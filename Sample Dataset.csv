Towards standardization of RNA quality assessment using user-independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces,"Purity and integrity of RNA are critical elements for the overall success of RNA-based analyses, including gene expression profiling methods to assess the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single assay. Starting with low quality RNA may strongly compromise the results of downstream applications which are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and highly expensive. However, in spite of the need for standardization of RNA sample quality control, presently there is no real consensus on the best classification criteria. Conventional methods are often not sensitive enough, not specific for single-stranded RNA, and susceptible to interferences from contaminants present in the sample. For instance, when using a spectrophotometer, a ratio of absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (A260:A280) greater than 1.8 is usually considered an acceptable indicator of RNA purity (1,2). However, the A260 measurement can be compromised by the presence of genomic DNA leading to over-estimation of the actual RNA concentration. On the other hand, the A280 measurement will estimate the presence of protein but provide no hint on possible residual organic contaminants, considered at 230 nm (3–5). Pure RNA will have A260:A230 equal to A260:A280 and >1.8 (1). A second check involves electrophoresis analysis, routinely performed using agarose gel electrophoresis, with RNA either stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) (6–9), or the more sensitive SYBR Green dye (10). The proportion of the ribosomal bands (28S:18S) has conventionally been viewed as the primary indicator of RNA integrity, with a ratio of 2.0 considered to be typical of ‘high quality’ intact RNA (1). However, these methods are highly sample-consuming, using 0.5–2 μg total RNA and often not sensitive enough to detect slight RNA degradation. Today, microfluidic capillary electrophoresis with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) has become widely used, particularly in the gene expression profiling platforms (11,12). It requires only a very small amount of RNA sample (as low as 200 pg), the use of a size standard during electrophoresis allows the estimation of sizes of RNA bands and the measurement appears relatively unaffected by contaminants. Integrity of the RNA may be assessed by visualization of the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands (Figure 1A and B); an elevated threshold baseline and a decreased 28S:18S ratio, both are indicative of degradation. A broad band shows DNA contamination (Figure 1C). As it is apparent from a review of the literature, the standard of a 2.0 rRNA ratio is difficult to meet, especially for RNA derived from clinical samples, and it now appears that the relationship between the rRNA profile and mRNA integrity is somewhat unclear (13–23). On the one hand, this may reflect unspecific damage to the RNA, including sample mishandling, postmortem degradation, massive apoptosis or necrosis, but it can reflect specific regulatory processes or external factors within the living cells. Altogether, it appears that total RNA with lower rRNA ratios is not necessarily of poor quality especially if no degradation products can be observed in the electrophoretic trace (Figure 1D).INTRODUCTIONFor all these reasons, the development of a reliable, fully integrated and automated system appropriate for numeric evaluation of RNA integrity is highly desirable. Standardized RNA quality assessment would allow a more reliable comparison of experiments and facilitate exchange of biological information within the scientific community. With that prospect in mind, and with the aim of anticipating future standards by pre-normative research, we identified and tested two software packages recently developed to gauge the integrity of RNA samples with a user-independent strategy: one open source, the degradometer software for calculation of the degradation factor and ‘true’ 28S:18S ratio based on peak heights (24) and the freely available RIN algorithm of the Agilent 2100 expert software, based on computation of a ‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) (25). Both tools were developed separately to extract information about RNA integrity from microcapillary electrophoretic traces and produce a user-independent metrics. Using these tools, we assessed the purity and integrity of 414 RNA samples, derived from 14 different human adult tissues and cell lines, many of which representing tumors. Those results were compared with conventional RNA quality measurement approaches as well as with highly expert human interpretation. We evaluated the simplicity for users and examined the potential, accuracy and efficiency of each method to contribute to standardization of RNA integrity assessment upstream of biological assays. These procedures were further validated by real-time RT–PCR quantitation of the expression levels of three housekeeping genes, using the same RNA samples, at different levels of degradation.Sample preparation ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTotal RNA was prepared from human cell lines (especially from the ATCC bio-resource center, N = 50) and tissue samples (clinical samples, N = 285) from 13 different human adult tissue types, i.e. blood, brain, breast, colon, epithelium, kidney, lymphoma, lung, liver, muscle, prostate, rectum and thyroid. RNA purification was performed by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (26), by phenol-based extraction methods (TRIzol reagent, Invitrogen, USA), or silica gel-based purification methods (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Germany; Strataprep kit, Stratagene, USA or SV RNA isolation kit, Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Material was maintained at −80°C with minimal handling. RNA extraction was carried out in an RNase-free environment (see Supplementary Table 1 online).Sample preparation ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe commercially available RNA samples were the ‘Universal Human Reference’ (N = 75) distributed by Stratagene (USA), and human brain (N = 2) and muscle (N = 2) RNAs supplied by Clontech (USA).Sample preparation ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSOnce extracted, RNA concentration and purity was first verified by UV measurement, using the Ultrospec3100 pro (Amersham Biosciences, USA) and 5 mm cuvettes. The absorbance (A) spectra were measured from 200 to 340 nm. A230, A260 and A280 were determined. A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios were calculated. For microcapillary electrophoresis measurements, the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used in conjunction with the RNA 6000 Nano and the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kits. In total, 39 assays were run in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (see Supplementary Notes online). To evaluate the reliability of the classifier systems described in this study, replicate runs were done on a set of 56 RNA samples loaded on different chips, resulting in 2 (N = 41), 3 (N = 12), 7 (N = 2) and 50 (N = 1) data points per sample.Human RNA integrity categorization ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSRNA integrity checking was performed by expert operators who classified each total RNA sample within a predefined discrete category from 1 to 5, examining the integrity of the RNA from electropherograms (see Supplementary Table 2 online). A low number indicates high integrity. Reference criteria parameters include ribosomal peaks definition, baseline flatness, existence of additional or noise peaks between ribosomal peaks, low molecular weight species contamination and genomic DNA presence suspicion. A smearing of either 28S and 18S peaks, or a decrease in their intensity ratio indicate degradation of the RNA sample and results in the classification into the higher categories. To evaluate the robustness of this human interpretation, five highly experienced operators, trained in these cataloging steps, separately classified a subset of 33 samples from breast cancers. It included samples with varying levels of integrity: intact RNA (33%), low quality samples (20%) and a wide range of degradation (47%).Degradometer analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSBioanalyzer electrophoretic data were exported in the degradometer software folder (.cld format). For comparison of samples, the original data were re-scaled by the classifier system, first along the time-axis to compensate for differences in migration time, then along the fluorescence intensity-axis to compensate for variation in total RNA amount. As a result, fluorescence curves that have the same shape will have the same peak heights after re-scaling. Then, Degradation Factors (DegFact) and corrected 28S:18S ratios were calculated (see Supplementary Table 3 online) using the mathematical model developed by Auer et al. (24), examining additional ‘degradation peak signals’ appearing in the lower molecular weight range and comparing them to ribosomal peak heights. Calculation of the DegFact is based on a numbering of continuous metrics, ranging from 1 to ∞; increasing DegFact values correspond to more degradation, and a new group of integrity is defined after 8 graduation steps. Once the classification of the RNA samples is completed, 4 groups of integrity are displayed, 3 showing an alert warning indicative of some measurable degradation (Yellow: 8–16, Orange: 16–24 and Red: ≥24), while all non-reliable data come together and form the fourth group (Black). We introduced a fifth class labeled White (<8), when no alert was produced by the software.Degradometer analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSSoftware and manual are freely available at . Degradometer version 1.4.1 (released in May 2004) of the software was used.‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) algorithm analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSBioanalyzer electrophoretic sizing files (.cld format) collected with biosizing software version A.02.12.SI292 (released in March 2003) were imported in the Agilent 2100 expert software (RIN beta release). The RIN algorithm allows calculation of RNA integrity using a trained artificial neural network based on the determination of the most informative features that can be extracted from the electrophoretic traces out of 100 features identified through signal analysis. The selected features which collectively catch the most information about the integrity levels include the total RNA ratio (ratio of area of ribosomal bands to total area of the electropherogram), the height of the 18S peak, the fast area ratio (ratio of the area in the fast region to the total area of the electropherogram) and the height of the lower marker.‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) algorithm analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSA total of 1300 electropherograms of RNA samples from various tissues of three mammalian species (human, mouse and rat), showing varying levels of degradation and an adaptive learning approach were used in order to assign a weight factor to the relevant features that describe the RNA integrity. A RIN number is computed for each RNA profile (see Supplementary Table 4 online) resulting in the classification of RNA samples in 10 numerically predefined categories of integrity. The output RIN is a decimal or integer number in the range of 1–10: a RIN of 1 is returned for a completely degraded RNA samples whereas a RIN of 10 is achieved for intact RNA sample.‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) algorithm analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSIn some cases, the measured electropherogram signals are of an unusual shape, showing for example peaks at unexpected migration times, spikes or abnormal fluctuation of the baseline. In such cases, a reliable RIN computation is not possible. Several separate neural networks were trained to recognize such anomalies and display a warning to the user or even suppress the display of a RIN number. Combining the results of the neural network for the RIN computation and the neural networks to detect anomalies, the RIN algorithm achieves a mean square error of 0.1 and a mean absolute error of 0.25 on an independent test set.‘RNA Integrity Number’ (RIN) algorithm analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe beta release of the software and manual are freely available at . Agilent 2100 expert version B.01.03.SI144 (released in November 2003) of the software was used.Real-time RT–PCR ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression levels of three housekeeping genes (HKG)—GAPD, GUSB and TFRC—were measured by quantitative PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sixteen aliquots of a unique batch of RNA sample (Universal Human Reference RNA, Stratagene, USA) of various levels of integrity (cf. Table 1) were used to test the influence of RNA quality on the relative expression of those three genes. In parallel, a 5′ to 3′ comparison was done using two separate GUSB and TFRC TaqMan probes.Real-time RT–PCR ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAn homogeneous quantity (0.8–1 μg) of the RNA samples was subjected to a reverse transcription step using the high-capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) as described by the manufacturer. Single-stranded cDNA products were then analyzed by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, USA). Single-stranded cDNA products were analyzed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, USA). The efficiency and reproducibility of the reverse transcription were tested using 18S rRNA TaqMan probes. Five assays were used, GAPDH-5′ (Hs99999905_m1), GUSB-5′ (Hs00388632_gH), GUSB-3′ (Hs99999908_m1), TFRC-5′ (Hs00951086_m1) and TFRC-3′ (Hs00951085_m1). In each case, duplicate threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained and averaged; then expression levels were evaluated by a relative quantification method (27). The fold change in one tested HKG (target gene) was normalized to the 18S rRNA (reference gene) and compared to the highest quality sample (calibrator sample), using the following formula: Fold change = 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = (Ct-target − Ct-reference)sample-n − (Ct-target − Ct-reference)calibrator-sample. Sample-n corresponds to any sample for the target gene normalized to the reference gene and calibrator-sample represents the expression level (1×) of the target gene normalized to the reference gene considering the highest quality sample. Mean 2−ΔΔCt and SD were calculated, considering the samples either individually or grouped by quality metrics categories, based on RIN metrics or DegFact values, together with the lower and upper bound mean of 95% Intervals of Confidence (IC). Using this analysis, if the expression levels of the HKG are not affected by the RNA degradation, the values of the mean fold change at each condition should be very close to 1 (since 20 = 1) (27).Statistical analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSDescriptive statistics were executed using the XLstat software, version 7.1 (Addinsoft, USA), P = 0.05. Mean, SD and coefficient of variation (variation or CV) between and within groups of samples were calculated, together with a measure of the dispersion (range), inter-quartile range (1st and 3rd quartiles, Q1–Q3) and evaluation of the lower and upper bound mean of 95% Interval of Confidence (IC). Comparative statistical analyses between groups were completed, P = 0.05, using non-parametric statistical tests: two-independent Mann–Whitney U-test and k-independent Kruskal–Wallis test.Conventional RNA quality characterization ::: RESULTSFollowing extraction, RNA purity was directly determined by UV measurement from the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios. We found an average A260:A280 ratio of 1.89 [Interval of Confidence (IC) 1.88–1.90] with 92% of the values falling within the theoretically expected range (1.8–2.1) (Figure 2A), and an average A260:A230 ratio of 1.99 (IC 1.92–2.06), with 73% of the values greater than 1.8 (See Supplementary Table 1 online for details). Significant differences in A260:A280 ratios were observed between specific groups of samples (i.e. tumoral versus normal or tissues versus cell lines). For instance, RNA extracted from normal samples displayed an improved ratio of 1.97, with 97% falling within the desired range (Figure 2A). In contrast, the distribution of A260:A280 ratios was not found to correlate with either purification methods or tissues of origin.Conventional RNA quality characterization ::: RESULTSRNA integrity was further assessed by resolving the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 protocol. The analysis was done on 399 RNA profiles; data from 15 samples was not obtained due to device problems during the runs. The system automatically provided 28S:18S ratios for 348 (87%) of the 399 profiles. Figure 2B shows the distribution of the 28S:18S computed values, with a median ratio around 1.7 and a variation of 54% from the mean (IC 1.9–2.1 and Q1–Q3 1.4–2.5). In addition, a significant degree of variability of the 28S:18S ratio (19–24%) was found for identical samples from replicate runs (2–50 times). Among those RNA samples, 28S:18S ratios of 2.0 or greater were rare, less than 44% of the values measured being within the theoretically desired range, except for the samples prepared from cultured cells (Figure 2B). The integration failed in the remaining 51 cases, displaying an atypical migration, with no clear 28S and 18S rRNA bands, and no 28S:18S ratio was computed (data not shown).Human categorization ::: RESULTSExpert operators categorized the set of RNA samples by inspecting the electrophoretic traces of successful assays. Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, 379 (95%) were scored within predefined categories (Figure 2C), namely good [Human Categorization (HC)-level 1], regular (HC-level 2), moderate (HC-level 3), low (HC-level 4) and degraded (HC-level 5). The remaining 20 (5%) were flagged as displaying a temperature-sensitive profile: RNA samples initially found intact became highly degraded when heated, although no RNase contamination was observed (data not shown). Estimation of the robustness of this cataloging was done through comparison of qualifying criteria using a set of 33 breast cancer samples (see Materials and Methods). Integrity of the samples was evaluated independently by five expert operators, and categorization was found highly reliable with a coefficient variation (CV) ∼16%. This is low considering that individual interpretation is involved, but can be explained by the fact that very experienced operators accomplished the scoring based on a clearly defined set of instructions, thus limiting frequently observed subjective visual interpretation and inconsistency of human categorization.Human categorization ::: RESULTSPredictably, a 28S:18S ratio of 2.0 denoted high quality for a majority of RNA samples, 91% being classified in HC-levels 1 to 3. However, 83% of total RNAs with 28S:18S ≥ 1.0 but a low baseline between the 18S and 5S rRNA or front marker were also classified in HC-levels 1–3 (see Figure 1D) and could be considered suitable for most downstream applications.User-independent classification ::: RESULTSRNA degradation was first assessed using the degradometer software (see Materials and Methods). Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, all were scored in one of the five predefined classes (Figure 3A). Altogether, 334 (84%) Degradation Factors (DegFact) values were computed, the remaining 65 RNA samples (16%) displaying profiles that could not be interpreted reliably; no DegFact values could be scored, and samples were flagged in the Black category (Figure 3A). Most of them (80%) correspond to samples previously classified by our operators as degraded (HC-level 5). The remaining cases had an average degradation factor of 7.5 (IC 6.7–8.3) with large variations over the entire set of samples (over 103% from the mean, range 1–52). A lower variability was persistently found when identical samples from replicate runs were considered, resulting in observed DegFact values with a 26–32% CV. In addition, statistically significant differences were found between DegFact values of samples sorted by types. The highest DegFact values were found characteristic of tissue samples, 41% of them displaying a DegFact > 8, as compared with 6% for the cell lines (data not shown).User-independent classification ::: RESULTSRemarkably, we found a significant linear relationship between the DegFact values distribution and the explicit human categorization. Most HC classes corresponded to an unambiguous DegFact distribution (Figure 3B), while HC-levels 2 and 3 form a single class: HC-level 1, mean DegFact of 3.3, SD of 2.8 (IC 2.8–3.7); HC-level 2 and 3, mean DegFact of 8.8, SD of 6.8 (IC 7.5–10.2); HC-level 4, mean DegFact of 15.9, SD of 7.8 (IC 12.7–19.1); HC-level 5, mean DegFact of 26.0, SD of 7.5 (IC 21.9–30.1). It is worth mentioning that the normalized heights of 18S and 28S peaks, and the interval between them after rescaling gradually decrease and then reverse with increasing degradation (Figure 3B).User-independent classification ::: RESULTSIntegrity of RNA samples was measured in parallel based on the RNA Integrity Number metrics using an artificial neural network trained to distinguish between different RNA integrity levels by examining the shape of the microcapillary electrophoretic traces (see Materials and Methods). Over the 399 RNA profiles checked, 363 (91%) were scored successfully (Figure 4A), with an average RIN of 7.7 (IC 7.4–8.0). The remaining 36 (9%) samples were associated with various unexpected signals, disturbing computation of the RIN using default anomaly detection parameters. In each case, a flag alert was added corresponding to critical anomalies including unexpected data in sample type, (or) ribosomal ratio, (or) baseline and signal in the 5S region (data not shown).User-independent classification ::: RESULTSRIN categorization was found regular, variability between replicate runs, compared to the other methods, being consistently very small (CV 8–12%). As expected, the highest RIN were characteristic of cell line samples, 72% of them displaying a RIN ≥ 9, as compared with 47% for the tissue samples (data not shown).User-independent classification ::: RESULTSA first group, corresponding to 295 (82%) of the 363 RNA profiles, was analyzed using the default settings of the RIN system, but with a lower threshold of RNA quantity loaded (20 ng) for reliable detection of anomalies than that recommended by the manufacturer (50 ng). A significant linear relationship was found between the RIN number and both the explicit human classification provided by our operators, and the DegFact values calculated by the degradometer software (Figure 4B). Each distinct HC class corresponds to an explicit RIN number, with HC-levels 2 and 3 forming once again a single class: HC-level 1, mean RIN of 9.6, SD of 0.7 (IC 9.5–9.7); HC-level 2 and 3, mean RIN of 8.6, SD of 0.9 (IC 8.4–8.9); HC-level 4, mean RIN of 6.1, SD of 1.5 (IC 5.2–7.1); HC-level 5, mean RIN of 3.7, SD of 2.0 (IC 2.9–4.5).User-independent classification ::: RESULTSFor the remaining 68 samples (assay done with <20 ng of RNA), two separate groups were considered: 41 samples with a computed RIN below 5.0, and 27 above 7.0. All samples in the first group were derived from RNA 6000 Nano assays, with mean RNA quantities loaded below 10 ng (Q1–Q3, 5–12 ng), i.e. below the lower limit of quantitation indicated by the manufacturer. All but 8 of these samples were estimated by our operators to be of poor quality (HC-level 4; N = 3) or degraded (HC-level 5; N = 30), and all but 4 were flagged Black by the degradometer software and no DegFact values were scored. These RNA profiles could not be interpreted reliably, possibly due to either the low RNA concentration or the unusual migration behavior and shifted baseline values of degraded samples. Thus, the two automated systems were in disagreement for these samples; while human interpretation was in most cases in agreement with the RIN system, with less than 20% of inconsistency. In the second group of 27 samples, 20 of the profiles were derived from RNA 6000 Pico assays with RNA quantities loaded being on average below 4 ng (Q1–Q3, 0.5–0.8 ng), which is within the manufacturer specifications. All but 3 of them were estimated by our operators to range from high (HC-level 1; N = 12) to correct (HC-level 2 and 3; N = 12) quality levels. In addition, all RNA profiles except 1 were scored by the degradometer software, most of them displaying an alert flag (N = 20); some slight degradation was detected, associated to a low mean DegFact value of 9.7 (IC 8.1–11.3; Q1–Q3, 6.2–12.6). Thus, both automated systems and human interpretations agreed in most of these cases, with <11% of inconsistency.Gene expression profiling versus RNA quality ::: RESULTSThe influence of RNA quality categorization obtained with both user-independent classifiers on gene expression profiling was explored using real-time RT–PCR. The expression levels of three housekeeping genes (HKG)—GAPDH, GUSB and TFRC—were measured in 16 aliquots of a unique RNA displaying various integrity metrics (Table 1). The mean correlation coefficient (r) between the threshold cycle (Ct) among the 16 samples and both quality metrics was found high: r = −0.87 considering the RIN metrics and r = 0.85 considering the DegFact values. The values of the mean fold changes, calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt quantification method (see Materials and Methods), were found lower than 1.0, corresponding to the expression level (1×) in the sample exhibiting the highest RNA quality (Table 2 and Figure 5). Considering that HKG expression was measured relative to the reference sample, an obvious decline of the relative expression levels was observed, up to 24, 70 and 82%, in samples categorized according to the RIN metrics (Figure 5A) and DegFact values (Figure 5B). These results indicate that 2- to 7-fold differences may be expected in the relative expression levels of genes in samples that differ only by their quality (Table 2). These fold differences are much larger than those measured for RNA samples of comparable integrity, consistently lower than 1.6 (Table 2 and Figure 5). In addition, an unambiguous gap in the distribution may be defined (Figure 5A and B), distinguishing the RNA samples of the higher quality categories (RIN ≥ 8 and DegFact values < 7) from those of the lower categories (RIN < 8 and DegFact values ≥ 12).Gene expression profiling versus RNA quality ::: RESULTSIt would be expected that measuring expression of an intact mRNA would yield approximately equal results regardless of the region being probed, and if mRNA fragmentation had occurred, then some sequences may be more abundant than others. We thus tested the effect of PCR probe location on the RNAs. The 5′ and 3′ GUSB probes, separated by 1209 nt, were associated with highly similar threshold cycle (Ct) measures (r = 0.98, β parameter = 0.88) (Figure 5C). Similar results were obtained for TFRC, with probes separated by 2066 nt (r = 0.84, β parameter = 0.92, data not shown). It seems therefore that the region being probed is not a source of variation in our results.DISCUSSIONIt is universally accepted that RNA purity and integrity are of foremost importance to ensure reliability and reproducibility of downstream applications. In the biomedical literature (PubMed, November 2004), from the 485 090 articles that relate to RNA, and the 287 515 or 40 395 including respectively the ‘quality’ or ‘integrity’ term, less than 100 were found to contain ‘RNA quality’ or ‘RNA integrity’ terms. Interestingly, half of them were published between 2001 and 2004; but none is proposing a standard operational procedure for RNA quality assessment to the scientific community. Except for two studies (24,25), those reports are based on 10 to 15 years old methods (1), indicating that they represent the established and currently mostly used methods. Our results strongly challenge the reliability and usefulness of those conventional methods, demonstrating their inconsistency to evaluate RNA quality.DISCUSSIONFirst, the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios are reflecting RNA purity, but are not informative regarding the integrity of the RNA. Available RNA extraction and purification methods yield highly pure RNA with very little DNA or other contaminations, resulting most often in both ratios ≫1.8, although 18% of the samples were found degraded and 7% more of poor quality. The high A260:A280 ratios are indicative of limited protein contaminations, whereas high A260:A230 ratios are indicative of an absence of residual contamination by organic compounds such as phenol, sugar or alcohol, which could be highly detrimental to downstream applications. Nonetheless, samples displaying low A260:A230 ratios (≪1.8) did not exhibit any inhibition during downstream applications, such as cDNA synthesis and labeling or in vitro transcription (data not shown). Second, due to a lack of reliability, the 28S:18S rRNA ratios may not be used as a gold standard for assessing RNA integrity. When ribosomal ratios were calculated from identical samples but through independent runs, a large degree of variability (CV 19–24%) was observed. Moreover, using the biosizing software, we found 28S:18S rRNA ratios evaluation compromised by the fact that their calculation is based on area measurements and therefore heavily dependent on definition of start and end points of peaks. In 13% of the cases, the system was unable to localize the ribosomal peaks, and therefore no 28S:18S ratios were computed. For the remaining samples, no clear correlation between 28S:18S ratios and RNA integrity was found although RNAs with 28S:18S >2.0 were usually of high quality. Most of the RNAs we studied (83%), displaying a 28S:18S > 1.0, could be considered of good quality. Interestingly, Auer et al. (24) in a study on 19 tissues from seven organisms, reported that an objective measurement of the RNA integrity may possibly be done through comparison of re-scaled 28S and 18S peak heights, but not of the corresponding areas. Actually, we observed a linear relationship between RNA integrity and differences in normalized 28S and 18S peak heights. Increased degradation resulted in a significant decrease in the scaled corrected heights of the ribosomal peaks, with inversion of the ratio at the highly degraded stages (cf. Figure 3B). In comparison to the area computation, 28S:18S rRNA re-scaled peak height measurement produced more consistent values, with a CV reduced to 12–14%, and displayed clear concentration-independent values (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 3 online). Human evaluation of the integrity of RNA through visual inspection of the electrophoresis profiles provided very consistent data. Variability between classifications produced by five independent expert operators (CV 16%) was lower than with automated management of more conventional control 28S:18S area values (CV 19–24%). It is, however, very time-consuming and strongly dependent on individual competence. Even with highly trained specialists, 5% of the set of RNA samples could not be allocated to any of the five predefined categories; their corresponding profiles were considered by our experts as atypical, displaying a temperature-sensitive shape (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThese strategies appear unsuitable for standardization and quality control of RNA integrity assessment, which require simple but consistent expert-independent classification, facilitating information exchanges between laboratories. We therefore investigated the performance of two recently developed user-independent software algorithms (24,25). The degradometer software provided a reliable evaluation of RNA integrity based on the identification of additional ‘degradation peak signals’ and their integration in a mathematical calculation together with the ribosomal peak heights. It allowed characterization of the integrity of 84% of the samples tested, one-third with an alert flag, which was first found to be fairly informative, as it strongly reduces the complexity of the metrics by introducing three distinct classes labeled Yellow, Orange and Red, and can be used as a first straightforward simple filtering step. However, degradation factors (DegFact) metrics yield precise measures with less than 32% CV and are much more valuable than flag alerts for the purpose of standardization. The same is true for the RNA Integrity Number ‘RIN’ software which allowed the characterization of the integrity of 91% of the RNA samples tested, with a RIN value for 363 RNA sample profiles with less than 12% CV. In general, there was a good agreement between the human classification, the degradation factor and the RIN (see Figure 4B). This provided a cross-validation of the user-independent qualification systems tested. Both resulted in the refinement of human interpretations, validating four statistically relevant classes of samples, namely good (HC-level 1), regular/moderate (HC-level 2 and 3), poor (HC-level 4) and degraded (HC-level 5). Moreover, the 5% RNA samples previously flagged by the operators as displaying an atypical temperature-sensitive shape were unambiguously assigned to one or the other category of samples [RIN = 7.3 (IC 6.8–7.8); DegFact = 11.9 (IC 9.5–14.2); data not shown].DISCUSSIONAltogether, we found the degradometer and RIN algorithms to be highly reliable user-independent methods for automated assessment of RNA degradation and integrity. The RIN system is a slightly more informative tool, able to compute assessment metrics for 91% of the RNA profiles, compared to 84% with the degradometer software; the remaining being flagged respectively as N/A or Black alert. For samples available below a low limit of 20 ng (N = 80) the RIN system provided metric values for 85% of them, compared to only 46% with the degradometer software. Similarly, the RIN system was able to provide metric values for 81% of poor quality samples (including low quality and degraded samples; N = 96), whereas the degradometer software could classify only 44% of them. Another advantage with the RIN classifier is that, if there are critical anomalies detected (including genomic DNA contamination, wavy baseline, etc.), threshold settings may be changed and a reliable RIN value computed. This was the case for 25 of the 363 RNA sample profiles successfully classified by the system.DISCUSSIONWhile intact RNA obviously constitutes the best representation of the natural state of the transcriptome, there are situations in which gene expression analysis may be desirable even on partially degraded RNA. Some studies report collection of reasonable microarray data from RNA samples of impaired quality (28), leading to meaningful results if used carefully. Moreover, Auer et al. (24) recently concluded that degradation does not preclude microarray analysis if comparison is done using samples of comparable RNA integrity. We confirmed the direct influence of the RNA quality on the distribution of gene expression levels, by detecting using Q-PCR a significant (up to 7-fold) difference in the relative expression of genes in samples of slightly decreased RNA integrity, which is much larger than the variation within comparable RNA quality categories (cf. Figure 5 and Table 2). This may correlate with ratio discrepancies in gene expression experiments, and therefore with false positive and false negative rates of differential gene expression when comparing two samples. Therefore, computing reliable metrics of RNA integrity, even if the RNA is found to be partially degraded, may be highly valuable. The straight and unambiguous relationships established between human interpretations and both RIN and DegFact distributions indicates that, using these metrics, it should be possible to distinguish specific samples that are too disparate to be included in comparative gene expression analyses without compromising the results. Although the information provided by these user-independent classifiers is not a guarantee for successful downstream experiments, it gives a more comprehensive picture of the samples and can be used as a safeguard against performing useless and costly experiments.DISCUSSIONThus, the RIN system may be used as simple metrics that can be easily integrated in any sample tracking information system for definition of standard operating procedures under quality assurance following a scheme such as the one described in Figure 6. In this context, we suggest that the growing number of laboratories performing RNA Quality Control by microcapillary electrophoresis should be offered the option to report objective RNA quality metrics as part of the ‘Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment’ MIAME standards (29). Through registration of RNA profiles in a public electronic repository, such standardized information should enable and facilitate comparisons of RNA-based bioassays performed across laboratories with RNA samples of similar quality, in much the same way as sequencing traces are compared.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary Material is available at NAR Online."
Species-independent detection of RNA virus by representational difference analysis using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription,"Identifying the causative agent of an infectious disease is the cornerstone for its eventual control. For example, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1). Developments in molecular biological approaches in recent years have led to the identification of many unknown pathogens. Once a fragment from the agent's genome has been isolated and sequenced, standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence, and computer homology searches can then be used to identify the likely phylogenetic relationship of the agent with other known organisms (2). Additionally, sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method (3,4). Thus, a detection method that is not based on the known sequence is essentially required as an alternative method to the normal PCR method.INTRODUCTIONRepresentational difference analysis (RDA) is one of the most reliable methods for identifying new agents since it does not require prior knowledge of the agent's class (5). The technique is based on PCR enrichment of DNA fragments that are present in agent-infected cells but absent in normal cells. Using RDA, Chang et al. (6) isolated two DNA fragments from a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesion in an AIDS patient. The determination of sequences of these fragments resulted in the discovery of the KS-associated herpes virus (7). Despite the fact that RDA has been developed for detecting agents with a DNA-based genome, it can be used to detect the presence or absence of RNA in a sample by generating a cDNA intermediate (cDNA RDA) to amplify the RNA (8). Since a large quantity of ribosomal RNAs interfere with cDNA RDA, the cDNA intermediate should be synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA. Therefore, it is difficult to detect RNA viruses from virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA because many viruses have no poly(A) at the end of the genome. If cDNA RDA can be applied to total RNA without interference with ribosomal RNAs, the virus genome can be amplified from total RNA of virus-infected cells by cDNA RDA.INTRODUCTIONThe selection of poly(A)+ RNA by using an oligo(dT) column followed by oligo(dT) priming can eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs on cDNA synthesis. Primers that are specific to a viral genome also efficiently eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs. However, prior knowledge of the virus genome is required for the construction of specific primers. In this study, based on the fact that cDNA can be primed with a mixture of oligomers, we constructed a set of oligomers that was inefficient for priming ribosomal RNAs but that normally primed most of the genome of an RNA virus (9,10). Based on the frequency distribution of hexanucleotides in ribosomal RNAs and viral sequences in current public databases, we determined a mixture of 96 hexanucleotides that rarely prime ribosomal RNAs but can prime all the known mammalian viruses listed in public databases. The results of this study show that species-independent detection of viral RNA from infected cells is possible.Design and synthesis of a primer mixture ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSA rat primary transcript, including 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA (V01270.1), was selected for hexanucleotide frequency analysis of ribosomal RNAs. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV (AY291315) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPI3, NC_002161) were also selected as representatives of RNA virus (11). We created three programs, GREG, GAS and OSC (produced by C's Labs, Sapporo, Japan and licensed by Sigma–Aldrich Co. Ltd, St Louis, MO), connected to a MySQL database server (version 4.0.20). The program GREG transformed FASTA-formatted sequence to a text-formatted sequence and inserted it into a table in the MySQL database (GREG table). Using these programs, we designed a mixture of hexanucleotide primers. First, sequences were divided into hexamers, and each hexamer was classified into a pattern of hexanucleotide sequence in which 46 = 4096 patterns were included. The program GAS generated frequency distributions of hexanucleotides in the sequences in the GREG table, extracted the progeny with their probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns and inserted them into a table (GAS table) of the database. We made four sets of GREG and GAS tables for rat ribosomal RNAs, a satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV (Table 1). The program OSC listed the differences between the two GAS tables, i.e. the program selected oligomer patterns that exist in BPI3 but not in ribosomal RNAs. The frequency of hexamer patterns in each RNA sequence was transferred into a table of Microsoft Access. A total of 96 hexamer patterns, including those having very low frequencies or those that did not appear in ribosomal RNAs, were synthesized and mixed for use as an RT primer (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides).Database for mammalian viral genomic data ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTo estimate the frequencies of priming sites with the selected hexanucleotides, we prepared a MySQL table that included sequence data of reported viral genomes as follows. First, we downloaded all viral sequences from the FTP site of EMBL database (release date 30 June 2004) and entered them into tables (EMBL data table) of the MySQL database. The table included EMBL ID, title, annotation and sequence as fields. The annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. We separated the words included in the annotation field into taxonomic words, such as family names, and inserted them into a new table (taxonomic table), in which EMBL IDs and taxonomic words were included. We then selected EMBL IDs of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in Table 5 from the taxonomic table. Next, sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. To determine the targets for hexanucleotide analysis, EMBL IDs having the longest sequence in the species were selected as the estimated genomic sequence of the virus, and then, a new table named ‘Sequences of viral species’ was prepared. Although the longest sequence from each species was selected, some of these sequences were very short. Therefore, we eliminated sequences that were shorter than half of the common genomic size of each viral family. The resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled ’Genomic sequence of viral species’. The frequency of the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides was determined in sense and complementary strands of the sequences included in the table titled ‘Genomic sequence of viral species’.Culture of virus-infected cells and RNA extraction ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe strains SARS-CoV and BPI3 were Frankfurt1 and BN-1, respectively (12–14). SARS-CoV and BPI3 were propagated by serial infection of Vero E6 and MDBK cells, respectively (15).Culture of virus-infected cells and RNA extraction ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSVero E6 cells were routinely subcultured in 75 cm2 flasks in DMEM (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 0.2 mM/ml l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experimental use, the cells were split once in 25 cm2 flasks and cultured until they reached 100% confluence. Prior to the virus infection, the culture medium was replaced with 2% FBS containing DMEM. SARS-CoV, which was isolated as Frankfurt1 and kindly provided by Dr J. Ziebuhr (16), was used in the present study. The viral infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 10. The infection of cells with SARS-CoV virus and the subsequent treatment of SARS-CoV RNA were restricted in the P4 area in the National Institute of Infectious Disease, and the work with SARS-CoV was performed in accordance with the rules for infectious pathogens that have been notified by the National Institute of Infectious Disease.Culture of virus-infected cells and RNA extraction ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSMDBK cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma–Aldrich) supplemented with 5% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were infected with BPI3 at an m.o.i of 0.1. The work on infection of BPI3 was performed in accordance with the rules for pathogens that have been notified by Rakuno Gakuen University.Extraction and in vitro synthesis of RNA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to cDNA synthesis, contaminated genomic DNA in the extracted RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C for 1 h. RNA was extracted serially with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol according to the standard protocol and subsequently used as a control RNA.Extraction and in vitro synthesis of RNA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSFor the synthesis of a model RNA, the entire molecule of pCIneo plasmid was transcribed in vitro from a T7 promoter. The synthesized 5.4 kb RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and subsequently used as a test RNA. After quantitation, the test and control RNAs were mixed to estimate the sensitivity of cDNA RDA in various conditions.cDNA RDA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from the mixed RNA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides by using a double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, i.e. the total RNA was diluted to 1 μg per μl and mixed with dNTPs, the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, 5× reaction buffer, 0.1 M DTT and an RNase inhibitor. Reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 50°C for 60 min. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), E.coli DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and RNaseH (Invitrogen) at 16°C for 2 h. Double-stranded cDNA was digested with Dpn II, and the resultant fragments were extracted from the digest by using a silicon-membrane-based purification kit (Gene Elute Purification Kit; Sigma–Aldrich).cDNA RDA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSLinker-derived amplification of DNA fragments and selective amplification steps of cDNA RDA were performed according to the method described by Hubank and Schatz (17). Briefly, 0.1 μg of Dpn II-digested double-stranded cDNA was ligated with RBam24 and RBam12 linkers (5). An aliquot of 1 μl of the ligation solution was diluted with Taq mixture (10 μl of 10× Taq buffer, including 15 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM each of dNTPs). The mixture was preheated to 72°C, and then, Taq polymerase (Promega) was added and the mixture was incubated at 72°C for 5 min to synthesize a complementary strand against the overhanging region of RBam24. This was immediately followed by a denaturation step (94°C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94°C for 1 min and 72°C for 8 min) to non-specifically amplify 200–800 bp Dpn II-digested cDNA fragments with linkers (amplicons). After amplification, amplicons were redigested with Dpn II and purified with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit to eliminate the spliced linkers. Some amplicons, including the test RNA, were religated with JBam24 and JBam12 linkers. Amplicons with the second linkers were mixed with a large quantity of amplicons without the test RNA sequences.cDNA RDA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe mixture was precipitated with ethanol and 3 M sodium acetate, dissolved in 4 μl of 3× EE buffer {30 mM EPPS [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid], 3 mM EDTA, pH 8.0} and covered with mineral oil. After the mixture was heated to 99°C for 4 min, 1 μl of 5 M NaCl was added, and the solution was incubated at 67°C for 21 h. During this incubation period, amplicons from normal cellular RNA with a linker included in the test amplicons were hybridized with those from uninfected cells without a linker. After hybridization, the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 μl with reaction buffer of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) as described above. Amplicons having the linker sequence at both ends were amplified by a denaturation step (94°C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94°C for 1 min and 72°C for 3 min).cDNA RDA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSRNAs extracted from virus-infected cells were subjected to cDNA RDA as described above, by using amplicons synthesized from RNA obtained from uninfected cells.Southern blot hybridization ::: MATERIALS AND METHODScDNA RDA-derived fragments in quantities ranging from 100 ng to 2 μg were separated on agarose gels, blotted onto a Biodyne nylon membrane (Pall Co. Ltd, Port Washington, NY) by capillary transfer in 20× SSC (3 M sodium chloride and 0.3 M sodium citrate) for 16 h and fixed to the membrane by baking in an oven at 80°C for 30 min. pCIneo was used as a probe for the in vitro synthesized RNA. A random primer labelling kit (BcaBest Labeling kit, Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) was used for labelling with 32P and hybridized in SuperHybPlus hybridization solution (Sigma–Aldrich) according to the manufacturers' protocol.Southern blot hybridization ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAlthough amplicons are cloned into a vector to identify its sequence, according to ‘Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety Text of the Protocol’, amplicons from SARS-CoV-infected cells should not be cloned into any plasmid. Therefore, by performing hybridization, we identified that the sequences of amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells were identical to SARS-CoV. To determine probes for SARS-CoV, the PCR products predicted from the genomic sequence and sizes of cDNA RDA products were amplified from the SARS-CoV genome. These PCR products were purified, labelled with DIG and independently hybridized using a slit of the nylon membrane blotted with amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells. DIG labelling and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the DIG-hybridization kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Diagnostics Division, Basel, Switzerland). Hybridization was carried out with DIG-labelled DNA probes at 65°C for 16 h in DIG-hybridization solution.Cloning and sequence analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe cDNA RDA-derived fragments were respliced with Dpn II, separated on agarose gels, extracted with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit and cloned into pSPORT1 (Invitrogen). Plasmids that included cDNA RDA-derived fragments were selected by colony PCR and purified with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit. Three clones of the plasmid were sequenced along with the fragment to detect PCR errors. Sequences of the cDNA RDA-derived fragments were determined using a DYEnamic ET-terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) and an ABI Prism 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA) with M13 forward and reverse primers (Takara Shuzo). We used the BLAST program on NCBI to determine sequences that were homologous to the isolated fragments.Frequency distribution of hexanucleotides within the ribosomal sequences ::: RESULTSTo predict the major RNA molecule in cellular RNA, we synthesized cDNA from RNA extracted from normal bovine cells, synthesized amplicons by using random primers, spliced them with Dpn II and finally subcloned them into pSPORT1. Among the sequences of 30 selected clones, the sequences of 25 clones and 5 clones were highly homologous to those of ribosomal RNA and a 1399 bp satellite repeat (GenBank accession no. V00125), respectively. Based on this result, ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for analysing hexanucleotide frequency. Since the reported ribosomal sequences of mammals are highly homologous to each other, we selected rat premature 18S, 5.8S and 28S ribosomal sequences as ribosomal sequences for hexanucleotide frequency analysis. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV and BPI3 were selected as representatives of RNA viral sequence. Table 1 shows the probabilities [number of the patterns/(length of sequence × 2)] of hexanucleotides in the human ribosomal RNA, V00125 satellite repeat, BPI3 and SARS-CoV. If a random sequence is assumed, frequencies would be distributed according to the Poisson's distribution, and the average of frequency would be the same as the variance of frequency. Although the average/variance ratios of all the four sequences were <1, the ratio of ribosomal RNA was smallest in these sequences (Table 3). This value suggests that the probabilities of hexamer patterns of ribosomal RNA were strongly biased from random sequence. Based on histograms of probabilities, the distribution of the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA differed greatly from those of V00125 satellite repeat or BPI3 (Figure 1). It should be noted that 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence. To determine primer sequences that do not prime ribosomal RNA but prime viral RNA, the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA and satellite repeat were calculated. The hexamer patterns were then realigned in an ascending order according to the sum of probabilities, and the 1st to 96th patterns were selected as non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, i.e. we selected 96 rarest hexanucleotide patterns (Table 2, non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) in major transcripts in normal mammalian cells on the assumption that ribosomal RNA and transcripts from satellites are the most frequent transcripts in normal cells.Frequency distribution of hexanucleotides within the ribosomal sequences ::: RESULTSThe rarity of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with non-V00125-satellite and random hexamers was confirmed in reported sequences of mammalian ribosomal RNAs (Table 4). The probabilities were relatively low in all the mammalian ribosomal sequences reported in GenBank. It is considered that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides inefficiently primed ribosomal RNAs in reverse transcription. On the other hand, the probabilities of non-ribosomal, non-V00125-satellite or random hexamers were different among the satellite sequences.Frequencies of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in viral genomic sequences ::: RESULTSIn addition to the inefficiency to prime ribosomal RNAs, efficient priming of V00125-satellite-repeat and BPI3 with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides is shown in Figure 1. To predict priming efficiency in many viruses, the probability of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes was estimated. In 1791 viral sequences in ‘Genomic sequences of viral species’, the median probabilities of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides of all known viral sequences is 13.2–37.6 × 10−3 (Table 5). When the average probabilities were calculated in viral families, the minimum probability was 3.7 × 10−3 in Herpesviridae and the maximum probability was 44.8 × 10−3 in Poxviridae (Table 5). These median values of probabilities in viral genomes were greater than those of ribosomal RNAs (Table 4) and comparable with those of non-V00125 and random hexamers (Table 5). These data suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides prime cDNA synthesis in most viruses.Model experiment for differentiated amplification of viral RNA by cDNA RDA ::: RESULTSThe database analysis suggests that viral RNAs were efficiently primed by non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in comparison with ribosomal RNAs. We investigated the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides on cDNA synthesis by using in vitro synthesized plasmid RNA (artificial RNA) and total cellular RNA, including ribosomal RNAs. An autoradiogram of 32P-labelled double-stranded cDNAs that were synthesized using non-ribosomal hexanucleotides or a random primer and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 2. When test and total cellular RNAs were reverse transcribed individually, the efficiencies of cDNA synthesis from artificial RNA using random and non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were almost similar; however, the efficiency of cDNA synthesis of cellular RNA was markedly lower in a non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed cDNA sample than in a random primer-primed cDNA sample (Figure 2A). In the mixed samples of test and total cellular RNAs, ribosomal RNAs were inefficiently reverse transcribed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. The total incorporated counts in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed cDNAs decreased with a decrease in the proportion of the test RNA in the mixed RNA samples (Figure 2A). It is considered that the efficiency of reverse transcription depends on the proportions of the test RNA in the mixed RNAs. When approximately the same counts of cDNAs were loaded on the gel, synthesis of ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA (ribosomal cDNA) was obvious in random primer-primed cDNAs (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the synthesis of ribosomal cDNA was not obvious in the cDNA primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. A relatively large cDNA derived from artificial RNA could be observed even when a smaller proportion of test RNA was mixed with cellular RNA and non-ribosomal hexanucleotide-primed samples. These data suggest that the relative amount of test RNA-derived cDNA is greater in non-ribosomal hexanucleotides-primed samples than in random primer-primed samples.Model experiment for differentiated amplification of viral RNA by cDNA RDA ::: RESULTSAfter the first round of cDNA RDA, amplified fragments were observed on agarose by staining with ethidium bromide. The bands that corresponded to artificial RNA could be observed in 1:0, 1:1 and 1:10 (test:total cellular RNAs) mixtures when cDNAs were primed with a random primer. On the other hand, these bands could be observed in 1:0 to 1:300 RNA mixtures when cDNA was primed with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides (Figure 3A). This amplification of test RNA was confirmed by hybridization with pCIneo, which was a template for in vitro RNA synthesis (Figure 3B). The hybridized bands were observed even in a lane corresponding to 1:1000 RNA mixture. When cDNA was primed with a random primer, the hybridized bands could not be observed in 1:100, 1:300 and 1:1000 RNA mixtures. These data suggest that the lower limit of the test RNA amplification decreased at least 30 times when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription when compared with the data obtained by using a random primer.Detection of BPI3 and SARS-CoV sequences from infected cell RNA ::: RESULTSTo amplify virus sequence from infected cells, we subtracted amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those derived from virus-infected cells. Amplicons with linkers derived from the infected cells were mixed with amplicons without linkers derived from uninfected cells at the ratio of 1:100 before a hybridization step of cDNA RDA. At the end of the first round of cDNA RDA, the ladders of amplified fragments were generated from BPI3-infected cells when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used (Figure 4). No cDNA RDA-derived bands were obvious when a random primer was used for reverse transcription (data not shown). Amplified fragments from cDNA RDA of BPI3-infected cells were cloned into pSPORT1 plasmid, and the sequences were determined. The sequences of all the cloned fragments from cDNA RDA were identical to the sequence of the BPI3 genome. These data suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides enables the identification of the BPI3 genome sequence from infected cells.Detection of BPI3 and SARS-CoV sequences from infected cell RNA ::: RESULTSSimilar to BPI3, cDNA fragments derived from SARS-CoV were also amplified from SARS-CoV-infected cells (Figure 5). Viral origin of the amplified fragments was confirmed by hybridization (Figure 5B) and PCR amplification by SARS-CoV-specific primers (Figure 5A). These results indicate that genomic fragments of SARS-CoV can also be isolated by this method.Reduction of influence of ribosomal RNA on cDNA synthesis by non-ribosomal hexanucleotides ::: DISCUSSIONIt is well known that 3–5% and 30% of cellular RNA are estimated to be messenger and ribosomal RNA, respectively. The frequency of ribosomal RNA has been estimated by competitive PCR and real-time PCR to be 10 000 copies per cell (18). The amount of ribosomal RNA has been reported to be 1000-fold greater than that of frequently transcribed mRNA, such as beta actin and G6PDH. Thus, the repertoire of cDNA would be strongly affected by ribosomal RNA. This influence of ribosomal RNA has been avoided by oligo(dT) selection. Alternative strategy for the elimination of ribosomal RNA from total RNA, however, has not been developed. Therefore, there have been only a few applications of cDNA RDA for non-poly(A) RNA, such as those in viral genomes. In this study, we developed a new strategy for the elimination of ribosomal RNA in cDNA RDA through the construction of a hexanucleotide mixture and demonstrated its efficiency in cDNA RDA.Reduction of influence of ribosomal RNA on cDNA synthesis by non-ribosomal hexanucleotides ::: DISCUSSIONThe main purpose of PCR is specific amplification of a gene. However, methods using multiple primers for simultaneous gene amplification have been recently employed for DNA chip methods. In order to simultaneously detect multiple genes by using a DNA chip, mixed oligonucleotides have been used as a primer for reverse transcription. This usage of mixed primers was based on the assumption that the specificity of primers was equal to the summation of the specificity of each primer. Thus, we searched for primers that do not prime ribosomal RNAs by frequency analysis of hexanucleotides. The frequency and distribution of oligonucleotides in mammalian and viral genomes have been studied to search for common motifs that might be used for controlling cellular functions (19–23). Volinia et al. (22) found sets of common decamers that can be used for the control of transcription control signals or for the common amplification of viruses. Programs for frequency analysis have been useful for searching common oligonucleotides in many subsets of sequences. On the other hand, database programming is useful not only for searching common oligonucleotides but also for searching oligonucleotides that do not exist in a subset of sequences. In this study, we found that there were hexanucleotide patterns that were rare or that did not exist in ribosomal RNA sequences. We also showed that sequences of 96 selected non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are normally present in known viral sequences (Table 5).Improvement of detection efficiency of extracellular RNA on cDNA RDA ::: DISCUSSIONIn the experiment for the determination of the effect of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, we used a mixture of artificially synthesized and total cellular RNAs. The probabilities of hexanucleotide patterns in the sequence of pCIneo was different from ribosomal RNA (18.4 × 10−3, 22.4 × 10−3 and 23.0 × 10−3 for non-ribosomal, non-V00125 and random hexamers, respectively). The artificially synthesized RNA included 30 priming sites for non-ribosomal hexanucleotides and was efficiently reverse transcribed (Figure 2). In the model experiments, cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides efficiently reverse transcribed and specifically amplified the extracellular test RNA in the mixed RNA (Figure 3). cDNA RDA-derived detection of the artificial RNA was 30-fold more sensitive when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used than when random hexamers were used. These results suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides dramatically improve the detection efficiency of cDNA RDA.Application of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for viral detection ::: DISCUSSIONThe common existence of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides in known viral genomes (Table 5) and the improved sensitivity for the amplification of a non-ribosomal sequence in the mixed RNAs (Figure 3) suggest that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides could be used for non-specific detection of a viral sequence in infected cells. However, the sensitivity for sequence detection may be low when compared with that of common PCR using specific primers. Thus, the usage of this method might be restricted to infected cells that contain many copies of a virus.Application of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides for viral detection ::: DISCUSSIONThe copy number of RNA viruses is dependent on the virus species, host cells and replicative and productive state of viruses. In our experiment, we detected 3 ng of contaminated RNAs in 1 μg of total RNA. Although this sensitivity is considerably lower than that of normal PCR, our experiments on SARS-CoV and BPI3 suggest that the sensitivity of cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides is sufficient to detect these viruses in productively infected cells. Additionally, this method can be applied to most productive viruses, since sense and complementary sequences of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were found to exist in most of the known virus sequences in GenBank (Table 5). In conclusion, this method could be applied as an alternative method for the detection of any emerging viruses.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary Material is available at NAR Online."
Factors affecting translation at the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting site of Cocksfoot mottle virus RNA in vivo,"The principal mechanism of translation is the accurate decoding of the triplet codon sequences in one reading frame of mRNA. Specific signals built into the mRNA sequences can cause deviations from this rule. Viruses exploit several translational ‘recoding’ mechanisms, including translational hopping, stop codon readthrough and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [reviewed in (1,2)], for regulating the amount of proteins produced from their polyproteins. For positive-stranded RNA viruses, −1 PRF is the prevailing recoding mechanism and an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral proteins. Most viral −1 PRF signals are regulating the production of replication-associated proteins. Depending on the virus, the efficiency of −1 PRF can vary between 1 and 40% (3), and changes in the efficiency can inhibit virus assembly and replication (4–6). Therefore, −1 PRF can be regarded as a potential target for antiviral agents (4,7). However, the development of efficient antiviral drugs is still hindered, since little is known about the trans-acting factors and the biophysical parameters affecting the −1 PRF efficiencies. Database searches have identified putative frameshift signals from a substantial number of chromosomally encoded eukaryotic mRNAs (8). Thus, −1 PRF may also have an impact on the complexity of the proteome of several eukaryotic organisms.INTRODUCTIONTwo cis-acting signals, a slippery heptamer X XXY YYZ (the incoming reading frame indicated) and a downstream secondary structure, direct the slippage and are therefore essential for this event (9). −1 PRF takes place after the accommodation step in the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of both tRNAs into the overlapping −1 frame XXX YYY (9,10). The sequence of the heptamer allows post-slippage base-pairing between the non-wobble bases of the tRNAs and the new −1 frame codons of the mRNA. Downstream RNA secondary structures [reviewed in (11)] force the ribosomes to pause, and place the ribosomal A- and P-sites correctly over the slippery sequence (12). However, the pausing of the ribosomes is not sufficient for −1 PRF to occur (13); in fact, the duration of the halt does not necessarily correlate with the level of the −1 PRF observed (12). Crystallographic, molecular, biochemical and genetic studies suggest that a pseudoknot restricts the movement of the mRNA during the tRNA accommodation step of elongation by filling the entrance of the ribosomal mRNA tunnel (14). This restriction can be eased either by unwinding the pseudoknot, which allows the mRNA to move forward, or by a slippage of the mRNA one nucleotide backwards. Chemical agents such as antibiotics, certain mutations in the translation apparatus, and in translation elongation factors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics, have been shown to influence −1 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)].INTRODUCTIONThe parameters known to contribute to the efficiency of −1 PRF are the sequence of the slippery heptamer, the downstream secondary structure, and the length and sequence of the spacer between the two cis-acting signals. Up- and downstream sequences such as termination codons in the vicinity of the −1 PRF signals, or even several kilobases away from them, can affect the −1 PRF efficiencies (3,17–22). A specific sequence in the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) 3′ untranslated region (UTR), 4 kb downstream from the slippage site, is vital for −1 PRF (6,19). A stimulating effect is achieved through the formation of a tertiary structure, where complementary nucleotides from the 3′ UTR base pair with a single-stranded bulge in the cis-acting stem–loop (6). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was also shown to require a more complex secondary structure instead of a simple stem–loop for optimal −1 PRF in vivo (21,22). These investigations suggest that −1 PRF studies carried out with minimal frameshift signals may lead to inaccurate estimates of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products during infection.INTRODUCTIONCocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV; genus Sobemovirus) infects a few monocotyledonous plant species such as barley, oats and wheat. It has a monopartite, single-stranded, 4082 nt long, positive-sense RNA genome (23,24). The polyprotein of CfMV is translated from two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 2A and 2B by a −1 PRF mechanism (25). In this study, we wanted to determine the in vivo −1 PRF efficiency guided by the CfMV U UUA AAC heptamer and the stem–loop structure. In addition to the minimal signal (18), we decided to test the effect of flanking CfMV sequences for their ability to contribute to −1 PRF. We found that the surrounding viral sequences promoted more efficient −1 PRF than the minimal signal sequence in vivo when measured with the dual reporter vector system developed by Stahl et al. (26). Therefore, we carried out an expression pattern and deletion analysis to understand the molecular basis of the observed upregulation. In addition, we critically analysed the suitability of the implemented experimental system for this type of a recoding study. An interesting possibility is that the viral proteins produced via −1 PRF could regulate −1 PRF. This hypothesis was tested by co-expressing the CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with the dual reporter vectors.Plasmid constructs ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThree regions from the CfMV polyprotein ORFs (Figure 1A) were cloned into the NheI and BclI sites between the lacZ and the luc ORFs in pAC74 (26). This dual reporter vector was a generous gift from Dr J. Rousset of the Universite Paris-Sud, France. The inserted sequences 1602–1720 (A region), 1386–2137 (B region) and 1551–1900 (C region), were amplified by PCR using pAB-21 as a template (18). Primers were used to introduce NheI and BglII sites to the flanking ends of the inserts. Since NheI digestion removed lacZ ORF, it was reintroduced into the plasmids as a final cloning step. The resulting plasmids were named pAC-A, pAC-B and pAC-C. Corresponding inframe controls, where one nucleotide was added in front of the slippery heptamer, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Exsite, Stratagene) and named as pAC-Am, pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm, respectively. Deletion plasmids pAC-AB/ABm (1602–2137), pAC-AC/ACm (1602–1900), pAC-BA/BAm (1386–1720) and pAC-CA/CAm (1551–1720) were also generated. The target sequences are shown in Figure 1B. The base numbering refers to the CfMV genome as in (23). Transcription was driven from SV40 promoter. Plasmids encoded leucine (LEU2) and β-lactamase (ampicillin resistance) as selective markers. Plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae H23 [MATα hsp150::URA3 ura3-1 his3-11 15leu2-3 112trp1-1 ade2-1 can100]. Dual reporter plasmid pAC1789 and the inframe control pAC1790 containing a 53 bp sequence from the HIV-1 frameshift region (26) were used as a positive control for monitoring the −1 PRF efficiency.Plasmid constructs ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTo analyse the proteins produced during −1 PRF, lacZ-A/Am/B/Bm/C/Cm-Fluc fragments were cloned inframe with the N-terminal 6xhistidine-tag in pYES2/NT KpnI and XhoI sites (Invitrogen). Reporter fusions were amplified by PCR using pAC-A/Am, pAC-B/Bm or pAC-C/Cm as templates. The resulting plasmids were named pYES2/NT-A/Am, B/Bm and C/Cm. Protein expression was regulated from GAL1 promoter. Two CfMV encoded proteins, P27 (C-terminal end of ORF2A) and replicase (ORF2B), were cloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen). Translation initiation codons were introduced within the oligonucleotides during PCR. The resulting plasmids were named pYES-P27 and pYES-Rep. Control plasmids, which lacked the translation initiation codons were prepared by PCR-based mutagenesis (pYES-P27ΔAUG and pYES-RepΔAUG) and the resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing. Plasmids encoded auxotrophic marker for uracil (URA3).Plasmid constructs ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAll cloning steps were performed using standard protocols. Plasmids were amplified either in Escherichia coli DH5α or JM110, and purified with Qiagen columns. Inserts were verified by sequencing. Yeast transformations were done using the LiAc method (27), and transformants were selected on a synthetic minimal defined medium (SC) lacking the corresponding auxotrophic marker(s) encoded by the used plasmid(s). Bacteria (E.coli DH5α) were grown in LB-medium containing ampicillin, whereas yeast cells were grown either in YPD, or in an SC medium. Protein expression from GAL1 promoter was repressed during growth at SC medium containing 2% glucose. Expression was induced by replacing glucose with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose.Protein purification and analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSReporter fusions were expressed in S.cerevisiae INVSc1 (his3Δ1/his3Δ1, leu2/leu2 trp1-289/trp1-289 ura3-52/ura3-52) (Invitrogen) overnight. Protein fusions were purified in denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and analysed in 6% SDS–PAGE gels. Proteins were visualized either by Coomassie staining, or by using antisera raised against the CfMV polyprotein region 1386–1724 encoding CfMV VPg (28). Protein antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham).Protein purification and analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids pYES-P27, pYES-Rep, pYES-P27ΔAUG, pYES-RepΔAUG, or empty pYES2 were co-expressed with pAC-A or with the corresponding pAC-Am inframe control in S.cerevisiae EGY48 strain (MATα, ura3, trp1, his3, 6lexAop-LEU2) (Invitrogen). Transformants were grown overnight in SC-Leu-Ura media in non-inducing conditions, and used to inoculate induction medium. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase. Expression of the CfMV proteins was confirmed by western blotting using polyclonal antisera against the CfMV ORF 2a and 2b proteins (28). Determining the enzymatic activities as described below monitored the effect of CfMV P27 and replicase on −1 PRF.In vitro transcription and translation ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSFor the in vitro analysis, the lacZ-gene of pAC-A/Am, -B/Bm and -C/Cm vectors was replaced with PCR-amplified Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene from pRLnull vector (Promega). The resulting pACRF plasmids were used as templates for PCR in order to add T7 promoter upstream of the Rluc gene. These PCR products were used for RNA synthesis with RiboMax kit (Promega). Transcripts were treated with RQ1-DNase (Promega), purified with Qiagen RNeasy columns, and quantified spectrophotometrically. The integrity of the transcripts was checked in agarose gels. In vitro translations were carried out in wheat germ extract (WGE) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Reactions were incubated in room temperature for 60 min, and stopped on ice prior to enzymatic measurements.Enzymatic measurements ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSCell cultures were started from at least three independent clones and grown until the late exponential phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 15 s), and yeasts by vortexing with glass beads (0.5 vol) in +4°C for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and enzymatic activities were determined immediately. Total protein concentrations were measured by using a Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase (LacZ) and firefly or Renilla luciferase (LUC or RUC) activities were measured with commercial kits from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. LacZ activity was determined as the colour intensity at A414 nm. Luciferase activities were measured as relative light units (RLUs) with luminometer (Biohit or ThermoLabsystems). −1 PRF efficiencies were calculated from normalized firefly luciferase activities with the following formula: [(LUC activity from the test construct)/(LacZ or RUC activity from the test construct)]/[(LUC activity from the inframe control)/(LacZ or RUC activity from the inframe control)] × 100%.Dual reporter vectors ::: RESULTSIn CfMV, the motif for −1 PRF is the slippery heptamer U UUA AAC and a stem–loop structure 7 nt downstream (25). The efficiency of −1 PRF directed by CfMV cis-acting signals was assayed in vivo using a dual reporter vector system (Figure 1A). Since reporters are produced from one single mRNA, factors that affect the stability of the mRNA as well as the rate of translation initiation have a similar influence on the expression of both reporters, and these variations can be monitored as changes in the activity of the upstream reporter. We quantified −1 PRF by comparing the β-galactosidase normalized firefly luciferase activities derived from the test constructs via −1 PRF to those obtained from the inframe controls, in which identical β-galactosidase–CfMV–firefly luciferase fusions are produced without −1 PRF due to the added nucleotide in front of the slippery heptamer (see Figure 1A). Similar vectors have been shown to detect even small changes in the recoding efficiencies resulting from alterations in the cis- or trans-acting factors (26,29–32).−1 PRF in yeast and bacteria ::: RESULTSThree inserts of varied lengths from the CfMV polyprotein-encoding region (ORF2A/2B) were introduced between the two reporters (Figure 1B). The A-region, which at 119 bp was the shortest, represented approximately the minimal frameshift signal proven to be functional in vitro (18). The longest region was the B-insert. At 752 bp, it started from the 5′-terminus of the 12 kDa viral genome-linked protein (VPg) gene and continued to the end of ORF2A. This region encodes CfMV protein P27 with an unknown function (28). Since the minimal requirements for the functional frameshift signal in vivo were not known, an intermediate 349 bp C-sequence was also selected for the analysis. A well-characterized 53 bp frameshift cassette derived from HIV-1 RNA was used as a positive control. Our results regarding the HIV −1 PRF efficiency, 0.7 ± 0.1% in bacteria, and 4.5 ± 1.1% in yeast (Figure 2), are corroborated by those published earlier (26,33,34) indicating that our dual reporter system was fully functional.−1 PRF in yeast and bacteria ::: RESULTSβ-Galactosidase has been shown to retain its specific activity well, irrespective of the C-terminal fusions (35). This is important, since the first reporter serves to control the variations among the abundance and translation rates of the studied mRNAs (26,30). In addition to changes in specific activities, heterologous fusions can cause alterations in the solubility and conformation, which can expose cryptic protease target sites and reduce the stability of the proteins (36). Therefore, for a reliable quantification of −1 PRF, it was important to test that equimolar amounts of fusions produced from the corresponding test and control constructs had similar enzymatic activities. Most inframe controls and the analogous test constructs had equal absolute β-galactosidase activities (Table 1). Comparable results were obtained, if activities were normalized with total protein concentration (data not shown). These results indicated that the length of the fusion as such did not affect the specific activities. The β-galactosidase activity from pAC-Am inframe control was also comparable to activity obtained from an empty pAC74, where this enzyme has no fusion (data not shown). This further supported the view that the few observed variations in the β-galactosidase activities more likely resulted from the changes in translatability or stability of the transcripts. In addition to pAC-Cm, two inframe controls pAC-Am and pAC-ACm showed ∼25% lower β-galactosidase activities when compared to the equivalent test constructs (Table 1), indicating that the productivity from these constructs was reduced. Taken together, β-galactosidase seemed to fit well to be used as the first reporter and thus normalization factor in the in vivo experiments of this study.−1 PRF in yeast and bacteria ::: RESULTSCfMV frameshift signals generated significant −1 PRF in yeast. −1 PRF level measured from pAC-A was 3-fold higher than from HIV RNA (Figure 2A and B). The extent of −1 PRF directed by the minimal region A in yeast, 14.4 ± 1.9%, was at the same level as that reported for the CfMV minimal frameshift signal in vitro (12.7%) (18). In contrast to our earlier in vitro observations (18), the longer CfMV sequences upregulated −1 PRF in vivo. In yeast, the level of upregulation was 2-fold for pAC-B, the −1 PRF frequency being 26.3%, and almost 5-fold for pAC-C resulting in efficiency close to 70% (Figure 2A), which is an extremely high value, if compared to the other values published earlier (3). CfMV frameshift signals directed −1 PRF at a lower level in bacteria than in yeast (Figure 2B). The extent of −1 PRF directed by region A in bacteria was 2.4 ± 0.7%. As in yeast, the longest B region stimulated −1 PRF 2-fold in bacteria when compared with pAC-A. However, region C did not further improve −1 PRF, but programmed −1 PRF to similar levels as pAC-B, the percentages being 4.7 ± 1.6% for pAC-C and 5.5 ± 1.5% for pAC-B.−1 PRF in yeast and bacteria ::: RESULTSTo identify the sequence(s) responsible for the enhancement of −1 PRF in vivo, a deletion analysis was carried out. The 5′- or the 3′-sequences flanking the A-region were deleted from pAC-B/Bm or pAC-C/Cm as indicated in Figure 1B, which generated vectors pAC-AB/ABm, pAC-BA/BAm, pAC-AC/ACm and pAC-CA/CAm. −1 PRF frequencies were determined in yeast (Figure 2C). Increased −1 PRF was observed in all deletion constructs in comparison to the −1 PRF directed by the A region. The BA and AB regions promoted −1 PRF as efficiently as the B region, whereas regions CA and AC were better than region A, but not as good as region B. In other words, the presence of nucleotides 1386–1720, or downstream nucleotides 1602–2137, was sufficient to increase −1 PRF to the level directed by the region B. Thus, the deletion analysis did not identify single specific sequence region as being responsible for the increased −1 PRF frequencies.Protein analysis ::: RESULTSThe expression pattern of the test and control constructs was analysed to understand the basis for the observed upregulation in yeast. Cassettes containing the reporters and the studied intercistronic sequences were expressed and purified as N-terminal histidine fusions. This allowed us to capture all the N-terminally intact products. The affinity-purified proteins were separated in SDS–PAGE gels, and visualized either by Coomassie staining (data not shown), or by western blotting with the CfMV-specific anti-VPg antibodies. The expected β-galactosidase–CfMV fusions terminating at the end of the 0-frame in the test constructs were detected. Also, the longer transframe β-galactosidase–CfMV–firefly luciferase fusion proteins were present in both the test and the inframe constructs (Figure 3). Comparison of the Coomassie-stained gels with the western blots revealed that the antisera recognized the products terminating at the CfMV-encoding regions better than the transframe products. Furthermore, the small size of the CfMV-specific region in the pYES2/NT-Am decreased the binding of the antibodies to these inframe control fusions. Thus, this data were not suitable for quantitative analysis of −1 PRF. Interestingly, an additional protein, which reacted with CfMV-specific antisera, was co-purified from the cells expressing pYES2/NT-Bm and pYES2/NT-Cm inframe controls (Figure 3). The size of these fusions suggested that translation had terminated approximately at the site for −1 PRF signals. If such putative termination products were also present in cells expressing the test constructs, the correctly terminated 0-frame products in the western blots masked these products.Protein analysis ::: RESULTSA closer look at the absolute β-galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities revealed that firefly luciferase expression from pAC-Cm was clearly reduced (data not shown). In fact, expression from the inframe control was comparable to the corresponding pAC-C test construct. This was also obvious when the firefly luciferase activities were normalized with the total protein amount. After setting the activity from pAC-Am to a relative value of one, the corresponding values from pAC-Bm and pAC-Cm were 0.80 and 0.28. Although the β-galactosidase measurements (Table 1) suggested that the overall translatability of the pAC-Cm mRNA was also reduced to some extent, it explained the decrease in firefly luciferase expression only partially. In the light of these findings, the extremely high −1 PRF frequency estimate calculated for the C-region could be explained with more frequent translation termination at the frameshift signals of the pAC-Cm mRNA, which reduced firefly luciferase activity in relation to β-galactosidase.−1 PRF in vitro ::: RESULTS−1 PRF was also assayed in vitro in WGE. Although LacZ-encoding gene is suitable for the in vivo studies, it is an unsuitable first reporter for the in vitro determination of −1 PRF efficiencies due to its big size (30). In good agreement with this, we observed several unexpected products in the in vitro translations programmed with LacZ–CfMV–luc mRNAs (data not shown). Renilla luciferase has been shown to retain its specific activity irrespective of the C-terminal fusions (30). Therefore, we decided to use Rluc–CfMV–luc transcripts to determine the −1 PRF efficiencies in the cell-free system. First, we verified the suitability of Renilla luciferase for the intended in vitro experiments as described in (30). Transcripts encoding monocistronic Renilla luciferase and Renilla luciferase fused to firefly luciferase (Rluc-Am/Cm-luc) were mixed in different ratios and used to program the in vitro translations. Increasing concentrations of transcripts encoding the Rluc-Am-luc fusion resulted in linearly growing firefly luciferase activities. At the same time Renilla luciferase activities remained constant, which showed that its enzymatic activity was not sensitive to the C-terminal fusions (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained with Rluc-Cm-luc mRNA (data not shown). −1 PRF efficiencies were then determined with transcripts that contained CfMV regions A, B and C, and their corresponding inframe controls. In all cases, slightly higher −1 PRF frequencies were obtained than in vivo. In nice correlation with the in vivo results, enhanced −1 PRF was observed with the region B, although the effect was weaker than in vivo. In this context, region C did not differ from the minimal region A in its capacity to program −1 PRF (Figure 4B).Effect of CfMV proteins P27 and replicase on −1 PRF ::: RESULTSThe ratio between the CfMV P27 and replicase is regulated by −1 PRF during CfMV infection (28). We studied whether these proteins could regulate the −1 PRF process. P27, replicase, or an empty expression vector was co-expressed in yeast together with the dual reporter vectors containing the minimal −1 PRF test and inframe control regions as intergenic sequences (pAC-A and -Am). P27 and replicase expression was verified by a western blot analysis (Figure 5). A faint band having nearly the same mobility as the replicase was detected in cells grown under repressing conditions. However, due to the small size difference, this protein was not regarded as replicase.Effect of CfMV proteins P27 and replicase on −1 PRF ::: RESULTSEnzymatic activities were measured from yeast lysates prepared from induced cultures. Measurements showed comparable levels of β-galactosidase in all the samples, indicating that P27 or replicase expression did not affect the stability of the dual reporter mRNA or the translatability of the first reporter (Table 2). The effect of P27 or replicase expression was monitored by comparing the reporter activity ratios to those measured from cells harbouring the empty expression plasmids (Table 2). Co-expression of CfMV replicase did not affect the normalized firefly luciferase expression (LUC/LacZ) from the inframe control, whereas slightly increased luciferase expression from the test construct was observed. In contrast, P27 expression reduced firefly luciferase expression both from the test and the inframe constructs. The effect was stronger in the presence of inframe control as normalized firefly luciferase levels reached only 54% of expression measured from the empty vector control.Effect of CfMV proteins P27 and replicase on −1 PRF ::: RESULTSTo verify that the observed differences in firefly luciferase production depended on the studied CfMV proteins, we co-expressed the dual reporter vectors with plasmids having the first translation initiation codons of P27 and replicase deleted (pYES-P27ΔAUG and pYES-RepΔAUG). Western blot analysis with antisera against ORF2A or 2B did not detect any proteins produced from these vectors (data not shown). The obtained LUC/LacZ ratios were compared to those measured from cells expressing the CfMV proteins (pYES-P27 or pYES-Rep). LUC/LacZ ratios measured from cells expressing replicase were slightly lower than the ratios calculated from cells harbouring pYES-RepΔAUG plasmids, being ∼90% when co-expressed with pAC-A and ∼84% when co-expressed with pAC-Am. In the presence of P27, LUC/LacZ ratio of pAC-A reached ∼81% of expression measured from cells transformed with pYES-P27ΔAUG. Again the effect of P27 expression was more evident with pAC-Am inframe control as P27 expression reduced LUC/LacZ ratio to half (∼48%) when compared to the corresponding value measured from the cells harbouring pYES-P27ΔAUG. This verified that CfMV P27 was able to reduce the downstream reporter expression from dual reporter mRNAs. Since CfMV P27 had a proportionally stronger effect to firefly luciferase production from the inframe control mRNAs in comparison to the test mRNAs (Table 2), the calculated −1 PRF efficiency increased from 14.7 to 22.4%.DISCUSSIONSince −1 PRF studies are affected by a huge number of different parameters, it is not an easy task to determine the real ratio between the proteins produced via this mechanism in vivo. However, in viral systems, the efficiency of −1 PRF is an essential determinant of the stoichiometry of synthesized viral protein products, which must be rigidly maintained for efficient propagation of the virus. For example, frameshifting in retroviruses determines the ratio of structural (Gag) to enzymatic (Gag-Pol) proteins, and plays a critical role in viral particle assembly (5). In this study, the capacity of CfMV frameshift signals to direct efficient −1 PRF was analysed in vivo by using dual reporter vectors. The length of the CfMV sequence clearly affected the actual efficiency percent in vivo. The PRF efficiency was elevated when longer viral sequences were directing the −1 PRF, but the deletion analysis did not identify any specific region as being solely responsible for the enhancement. Up- and downstream sequences nearby or far away from the cis-acting signals have been reported to enhance −1 PRF in other viruses, such as HIV, human T-cell leukaemia virus and BYDV (6,19,20). Also out-of-frame stop codons have been shown to influence −1 PRF frequency in vitro in retroviruses (17) and in CfMV (18). A study on the spacer sequences located between the cis-acting signals showed that high slippage frequencies were obtained when the first three nucleotides were G/U, G/A and G/A, the first two being the most important (37). In CfMV, the spacer starts with UAC, which partially explains the capacity of the CfMV sequence to promote high slippage levels. In this study, the observed enhancement of −1 PRF was, however, caused by sequences that were not in the immediate vicinity of the slippery sequence thus indicating that CfMV sequences further away also have an influence on the level of frameshifting in vivo. We conclude that the most reliable estimates for −1 PRF and consequently for the amount of replicase versus the 0-frame translation product P27 can be obtained only by using the full-length viral sequences. In reality, such a study would however be hampered by the non-quantitative nature of the western blot analysis, the presence of different polyprotein processing intermediates, and the differences in the stabilities of the end products in the infected cells.DISCUSSIONThe overall competence of CfMV signals to direct −1 PRF was high, when compared to related plant viruses, such as Potato leaf roll virus and BYDV. −1 PRF values of ∼1% have been reported for these viruses when measured with reporter-based assays (6,38). We can hypothesize that one reason for the high efficiency is the slippery tRNAAsn encoding the AAC triplet of the CfMV heptamer. Equal U UUA AAC slippery heptamer has been measured to induce 20–40% of −1 PRF in a diversity of animal viruses [(39); reviewed in (3)]. The low fitness of CfMV −1 PRF signals in bacteria is in agreement with the poor functioning of the eukaryotic slippery heptamers of the order X XXA AAC in prokaryotes (40–42). IBV RNA, having an identical shifty heptamer, has been shown to direct −1 PRF at similar 2–3% level in bacteria (41). A recent study reported that XXXAAAC heptamers dictate −1 PRF to occur via the slippage of two adjacent tRNAs placed over the heptamer, irrespective of whether the host is an eukaryote or a prokaryote (42). Therefore, the inability of prokaryotic translation systems to direct efficient −1 PRF from this heptamer is not an inherited property of prokaryotic tRNAAsn, but results from differences in the ribosomes (42).DISCUSSIONPaused ribosomes can pass the −1 PRF site by −1 frameshifting, resumption of 0-frame translation, or termination (43). Transient polypeptide intermediates that result from the pausing of ribosomes in the slippery sequences have been observed during IBV and S.cerevisiae L-A virus polyprotein synthesis (12,13,43,44). A pseudoknot structure formed by IBV mRNA causes a translational pause at fixed position upstream the secondary structure regardless of whether the slippery heptamer is present or absent (12). Based on the findings of this study, we propose that also here a certain percent of ribosomes stalled at the secondary structure of the frameshift site in our inframe control and test mRNAs in yeast, and this led to the prematurely terminated products observed with the inframe control constructs pAC-Bm and -Cm. Although not unambiguously proven by this study, high frequency of termination of translation especially at the frameshift site of the pAC-Cm mRNA would nicely explain the extremely high calculated −1 PRF efficiency.DISCUSSIONFactors that change the translation fidelity and kinetics have been shown to influence −1 PRF efficiency [(10,15); reviewed in (16)]. Autoregulation of +1 frameshifting by mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme has been reported (45). This mechanism allows modulation of frameshifting frequency according to the cellular concentration of polyamines. One could speculate that such a regulation mechanism could also be useful to adjust the amounts of the replication-associated proteins to match the requirements of different phases in viral replication cycle. This hypothesis was studied by expressing CfMV proteins P27 and replicase together with pAC-A and pAC-Am in yeast cells. Since β-galactosidase production remained constant regardless of the presence or absence of CfMV proteins, they did not interfere with translation initiation from pAC-A/Am mRNAs per se. However, P27 expression caused a reduction in the firefly luciferase production especially from the inframe control, whereas replicase production only slightly increased the firefly luciferase production from pAC-A, but not from pAC-Am. Since replicase expression had only a faint effect on the normalized firefly luciferase production via −1 PRF, our conclusion is that CfMV replicase had no pronounced effect on translation at the frameshift site. Co-expression of the non-translatable form of P27 with the dual reporter vectors verified that P27 truly affected firefly luciferase expression on the protein level. Therefore, we propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site. If CfMV P27 indeed interferes with viral protein synthesis during CfMV infection, the mechanism, its specificity and the possible biological role needs to be elucidated in the future."
A universal BMV-based RNA recombination system—how to search for general rules in RNA recombination,"A recombination is a very common phenomenon. It has been observed in all types of viruses using RNA as a carrier of genetic information: in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (1–4), in negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (5,6), in double-stranded RNA viruses (7,8) and in retroviruses (9–11). Moreover, it has been shown that RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses but also between distinctly different viruses (12). Sometimes it also permits crossovers between viral and host RNA (13–17). Taking into account the structure of viral genomic molecules and the location of crossover sites, three basic types of RNA recombination were distinguished: homologous, aberrant homologous and non-homologous (3,4,18). The former two occur between two identical or similar RNAs (or between molecules displaying local homology), while the latter involves two different molecules. Most of the collected data suggest that RNA recombinants are formed according to a copy choice model (4,18). A viral replication complex starts nascent RNA strand synthesis on one template, called RNA donor and then switches to another template, called RNA acceptor. Accordingly, two main factors are thought to affect RNA recombination: the structure of recombining molecules and the ability of the viral replicase to switch templates.INTRODUCTIONTo gain more knowledge of the mechanism of RNA recombination, several model experimental systems have been created. They provided us with some specific data describing homologous and/or non-homologous recombination in particular viruses, e.g. in poliovirus, (19) mouse hepatitis virus (20,21), brome mosaic virus (BMV) (4,22), turnip crinkle virus (23,24) or tomato bushy stunt virus (25). As a result, the involvement of viral replicase proteins in recombination has been demonstrated (26,27) and a wide spectrum of RNA motifs supporting recombination have been identified (4,23,28–30). In general, the collected data suggest that there exist two major types of RNA structural elements that induce recombination events: (i) universal ones mediating template switching by different viral replicases, e.g. regions of local homology (28,31) or complementarity (32–35) and (ii) virus-specific ones, e.g. promoter-like structures (36,37). Unfortunately, up till now there has been no in vivo recombination system that could be used to test the recombination activity of any given RNA sequence and consequently to verify the above hypothesis and find some general laws governing the studied process.INTRODUCTIONIn our studies on genetic RNA recombination we have used the well-characterized in vivo system developed in BMV (30,33). BMV is a model (+)RNA virus of plants (38). Its genome is composed of three segments called RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3. RNA1 and RNA2 encode BMV replicase proteins 1a and 2a, respectively. RNA3 encodes movement (3a) and coat proteins (CP) (38). All three BMV RNAs possess an almost identical 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). The first BMV-based recombination system was created by Nagy and Bujarski (33). They constructed a recombinationally active BMV mutant whose genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and modified RNA3 (PN0-RNA3 called the recombination vector, for details see Figure 1). Only 3′-UTR was modified in PN0-RNA3, while its 5′-UTR, intergenic and coding regions were unchanged. Despite the introduced changes, the recombination vector is stable and replicates when used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to infect plants. It starts to recombine if a recombinationally active sequence (RAS) is introduced just between the CP coding sequence and the modified 3′ region (into the RAS-cloning site). Non-homologous recombination was observed when a 140–60 nt sequence complementary to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into PN0-RNA3 (a sequence from the 3′-portion of RNA1 was introduced in antisense orientation) (30,33). Interestingly, the same RNA1 fragment inserted in sense orientation did not support homologous crossovers (33). Non-homologous recombination repaired the RNA3 vector by replacing its highly modified 3′ end with 3′-UTR derived from RNA1. The resultant recombinants replicated and accumulated better than the parental RNA3 molecule, and so the latter was out competed from the infected cells. The above system is extremely efficient, since it employs selection pressure to support the accumulation of RNA3 recombinants. Because RAS is placed in two different segments of the BMV genome, we have proposed to name this system heteromolecular.INTRODUCTIONUnfortunately, Nagy and Bujarski's BMV-based recombination system has one serious limitation. It was designed in such a manner that viable RNA3 recombinants can easily form only if a sequence derived from the 3′-portion of RNA1 or RNA2 is used as a RAS. Consequently, the heteromolecular system could not be applied for testing the recombination capacity of various RNA motifs. Olsthoorn et al. (39) attempted to solve that problem by inserting examined sequences into the 3′-noncoding region of BMV RNA2 and RNA3. This system was not further developed, since any changes in RNA2, which encodes BMV polymerase, could strongly affect the studied process.INTRODUCTIONHere, we describe a new BMV-based recombination system. It has been constructed in such a way that both tested RASes are placed in the same segment of the BMV genome (in the modified RNA3 molecule); therefore, we have called this system homomolecular. To prove the usefulness of the homomolecular system, we have employed it to examine the recombination activity of sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. The examined sequences have been inserted into RNA3 as direct or inverted repeats. This demonstrated that the 101 nt hypervariable region of HCV efficiently supports both homologous and non-homologous crossovers, while the most conservative 98 nt portion of HCV's 3′-UTR induces only non-homologous recombination events. Moreover, a direct comparison of the hetero- and homomolecular systems revealed crucial differences between the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination. The former involves preferentially two different segments of the BMV genome and the latter occurs more easily between the same genomic RNAs.Materials ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids pB1TP3, pB2TP5 and pPN0-RNA3 containing full-length cDNA of BMV RNA1, RNA2 and modified RNA3 (recombination vector), respectively, were the generous gift from J. J. Bujarski (Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL).Materials ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSRestriction enzymes (EcoRI, SpeI and XbaI) T7 RNA polymerase, RNasine, RQ DNase RNase free, MMLV-reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase and pUC19 cloning vector were from Promega.Materials ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe following primers were used for the construction of pMatNH- pMatH-, pMatNH-HVR-, pMatH-HVR-, pMatNH-X-, pMatH-X-RNA3: (i) 5′-AAGGTACCCATGAGGAGTACTGTTTGGTTGCC-3′; (ii) 5′-AAGAATTCTGGTCTCTTTTAGAGATTACAG-3′; (iii) 5′-AAGGTACCACGCG TGGATCCGATATCATCTTTAATTGTGTTAAGTGATGCGC-3′; (iv) 5′-AATCTAGAC GTTGACGGGGGAACCTATTGT-3′; (v) 5′-AATCTAGAAAGCTGGATTTTCTGGGAT GACCC-3′; (vi) 5′-ATTCTAGATTTCCTTTTCTTTCCTTTGGTGGCTCCATCTTAG-3′; (vii) 5′-AATCTAGAACTTGATCTGCAGAGAGGCC-3′; (viii) 5′-ATACGCGTTTTCCTTTTCT TTCCTTTGGTGGCTC-3′; (ix) 5′-AAGATATCACTTGATCTGCAGAGAGGCC-3′; (x) 5′-AAACGCGTCGTTGACGGGGGAACCTATGTG-3′; (xi) 5′-AAGATATCAAGCTGG ATTTTCTGGGATGACCC-3′. The following primers were used for a specific RT–PCR amplification of the 3′-portion of BMV RNA3 (the region where recombinant junction sites are located): primer A—first strand primer complementary to the 3′ end of all BMV genomic RNAs and introducing the EcoRI restriction site, 5′-CAGTGAATTCTGGTCTCTTTTAGAGATTTACAAG-3′; primer B—second strand primer specific for RNA3, representing RNA3 sequence between positions 1726 and 1751.Plasmid construction ::: METHODSPlasmids pMag1- and pMagH-RNA3 contain full-length cDNA of the RNA3 vector carrying the recombinationally active sequence RAS1 inserted in antisense or sense orientation, respectively. Both plasmids were constructed in the same way: pPN0-RNA3 was linearized with SpeI endonuclease and ligated with SpeI cut RAS1 cDNA. Then plasmids carrying RAS1 in antisense (pMag1-RNA3) and sense (pMagH-RNA3) orientation were identified (30).Plasmid construction ::: METHODSTo prepare pMatNH-RNA3 and pMatH-RNA3 plasmids (containing full-length cDNA of MatNH-RNA3 and MatH-RNA3), pMag1-RNA3 and pMagH-RNA3 were digested with KpnI and EcoRI endonucleases. Then, the deleted fragment was replaced with a KpnI–EcoRI cut 379 nt cDNA fragment corresponding to the BMV RNA1 3′ end (containing the entire 3′-UTR and RAS1). The latter were obtained by PCR involving primers 1, 2 and pB1TP3 as a template.Plasmid construction ::: METHODSTo construct pMat0-RNA3, i.e. a plasmid containing cDNA of the universal recombination vector Mat0-RNA3, the following modifications were introduced into pMatNH-RNA3. First, it was digested with SpeI endonuclease and religated. This way 5′RAS1as was removed and the 5′RAS cloning site (including only one restriction site SpeI) was created. Next, the plasmid was cut with KpnI and EcoRI to remove RNA1 3′-UTR and 3′RAS1s. Instead, a 295 nt fragment of RNA1 3′ end (between positions 2940 and 3234) followed by the 3′RAS cloning site (including KpnI, MluI, BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites) was ligated into pMatNH-RNA3. The inserted sequence was obtained by PCR using primers 2, 3 and pB1TP3 as a template and digested with KpnI and EcoRI, prior to ligation.Plasmid construction ::: METHODSTo test the recombination activity of HCV-derived sequences (hypervariable region 1, abbreviated HVR and sequence X, abbreviated X) cDNA of the corresponding fragments of the virus' genome was obtained by RT–PCR method (40,41) and cloned into the pUC19 vector. Then, both tested sequences were amplified by PCR with primers introducing an SpeI restriction site. Primers 4, 5 and primers 6, 7 were used to obtain HVR and X cDNA, respectively. PCR products and pMat0-RNA3 were digested with SpeI and ligated. Then pMat0-RNA3 derivatives bearing HVR and X in sense and antisense orientation were identified. HVR and X were amplified again by PCR involving primers introducing MluI and EcoRV restriction sites (primers 8, 9 and 10, 11 to amplify HVR and X, respectively). PCR products were cut with MluI and EcoRV and ligated into the 5′RAS cloning site of previously identified pMat0-RNA3 derivatives (carrying HVR and X in sense and antisense orientation). As a result four plasmids were obtained: (i) pMatH-HVR-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatH-HVR-RNA3 in which two HVRs were inserted in sense orientation; (ii) pMatNH-HVR-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatNH-HVR-RNA3 possessing two HVRs, 5′HVR in antisense and 3′HVR in sense orientation; (iii) pMatH-X-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatH-X-RNA3 in which two Xes are in sense orientation; (iv) pMatNH-X-RNA3—containing cDNA of MatNH-X-RNA3 carrying two Xes, 5′X in sense and 3′X in antisense orientation. Their structure was confirmed by sequencing.In vivo recombination assay ::: METHODSTo test the recombination activity of the BMV mutants, the previously described procedure was applied (30,33). Infectious BMV genomic RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription for which EcoRI linearized plasmids pB1TP3, pB2TP5, pMag1-RNA3, pMagH-RNA3, pMatNH-RNA3, pMatH-RNA3, pMat0-RNA3, pMatH-HVR-RNA3, pMatH-HVR-RNA3, pMatHN-X-RNA3 and pMatH-X-RNA3 were used. Five-leaf C.quinoa plants (local lesion host for BMV) were mechanically inoculated with mixtures containing BMV RNA1, RNA2 and one of the RNA3 derivatives. Two weeks post-inoculation, the number of lesions developed on each inoculated leaf was counted to establish the infectivity of the tested BMV mutant. Then, individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from every lesion. The isolated RNA was subjected to RT–PCR involving primer A (the first strand primer) and primer B (the second strand primer) specific for RNA3 3′ fragment amplification (the region where recombination crossovers occur). As a control identical reactions involving either parental RNA3 transcript (positive control) or water (negative control) were carried out. RT–PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The formation of 800 nt or shorter ∼500 nt products indicated that parental or recombinant RNA3 accumulated in the analyzed lesion, respectively. Next, RT–PCR products were cloned into the pUC19 vector and sequenced to determine the location of recombinant junction sites. Finally, the presence of recombinants in the selected local lesions was additionally confirmed by northern blot analysis.Construction of a mixed hetero- and homomolecular recombination system ::: RESULTSThe main question that we had to answer during our studies was how to design a vector that could be used for examining the recombination activity of any RNA sequences in vivo. As a result, the idea arose to construct a BMV-based homomolecular recombination system. In such a system, both tested sequences are supposed to be present within the same segment of the BMV genome (either in RNA1, RNA2 or RNA3). Thus, a new vector should possess two separately located RAS cloning sites, be replicable and stable during infection. It has to be capable of generating viable recombinants, which have selective advantage over parental RNA molecules. Consequently, recombinants ought to be able to out compete the vector with inserted RASes. Assuming that RNA recombination occurs according to a copy choice mechanism, we decided that RNA3, being dispensable for BMV replication, is the best candidate for a new vector. Any changes in RNA1 and RNA2, which encode BMV replicase proteins, would strongly affect the studied process. The next important question was whether the location of RASes within the same (homomolecular system) or within two different segments of the BMV genome (heteromolecular system) influences the recombination activity of the examined RNA sequence.Construction of a mixed hetero- and homomolecular recombination system ::: RESULTSTo address both issues, we decided to construct a so-called mixed system, homo- and heteromolecular at the same time. To this end two RNA3 molecules, prototypes of a new vector carrying two RASes, were prepared. To obtain them we used PN0-RNA3, described earlier, and a well-characterized recombinationally active sequence from BMV RNA1 (RAS1, see Figure 1). The 137 nt RAS1 corresponding to RNA1 between positions 2856 and 2992 was inserted into the PN0-RNA3 RAS cloning site, in antisense (RAS1as) and sense (RAS1s) orientations (Figure 2). As a result, we obtained Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 derivatives (30). Then the 356 nt portion of Mag1- and MagH-RNA3 3′ end was replaced with a 379 nt sequence representing the wtRNA1 3′ end (fragment encompassing the entire 3′-UTR and RAS1s sequence) (Figure 2). In addition, a marker mutation (called ΔXho) was introduced within the RNA1-derived fragment to make it distinguishable from an analogous region present in wtRNA1. To this end, the XhoI restriction site (2988–2994) was disrupted by a 4 nt insertion (GATC) between C-2991 and G-2992. Resultant RNA3 derivatives, called MatNH- and MatH-RNA3, have unchanged 5′-UTR, intergenic and coding regions and a highly modified 3′-UTR. The latter includes 3′-UTR coming from wtRNA1 and two RAS1 sequences (3′RAS1 and 5′RAS1) separated by a 338 nt spacer (sequence CCMV and B1). In MatNH-RNA3, 3′RAS1 is located in sense and 5′RAS1 in antisense orientation, while in MatH-RNA3 both RAS1 sequences are in sense orientation (Figure 2).Construction of a mixed hetero- and homomolecular recombination system ::: RESULTSHaving these two RNA3 derivatives, we were able to construct two variants of the mixed system: one for homologous (MatH-BMV mutant) and the other for non-homologous (MatNH-BMV mutant) recombination studies. The MatH-BMV genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatH-RNA3 and the MatNH-BMV genome of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatNH-RNA3 (Table 1). In genomes of both BMV mutants three copies of RAS1 are present: two in the RNA3 derivative (RAS1s-RAS1s or RAS1as-RAS1s in MatH- and MatNH-RNA3, respectively) and one in wtRNA1 (RAS1s). Thus, in the mixed systems two identical RASes or RAS and its complementary counterpart were capable of supporting, respectively, homologous or non-homologous (heteroduplex-mediated) recombination between the same or between different BMV genomic RNAs. As a result, we could directly compare homo- and heteromolecular recombination systems in one in vivo experiment and examine whether our presumptions concerning the new recombination vector are correct.Homologous recombination in the mixed homo–heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSEarlier, Nagy and Bujarski (33) demonstrated that the 66 nt portion of RAS1 did not support homologous recombination in heteromolecular system. We repeated this experiment using MH-BMV mutants. Recombinants also did not form although the entire RAS1 sequence was present in wtRNA1 and MagH-RNA3 molecules (Table 1 and Figure 3). To test RAS1 activity in the mixed homologous recombination system, a previously used, well-established procedure was applied (30,33). C.quinoa plants (local lesion host for BMV) were inoculated with a mixture containing in vitro transcribed wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatH-RNA3. After 2 weeks, when infection symptoms were well developed, the number of lesions formed on every inoculated leaf was counted to determine the infectivity of the MatH-BMV mutant. Individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from each of them. Then, the 3′-portion of RNA3 progeny accumulating in examined lesions was selectively amplified by RT–PCR involving RNA3 specific primers A and B (for their location see Figure 1). Reaction products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and their length was determined. The formation of an ∼800 or 400–500 nt DNA fragment indicated that the lesion contained parental or recombinant RNA3, respectively. In this way, we were able to determine the number of lesions in which a viable RNA3 recombinant was generated. The presence of recombinants in analyzed lesions was confirmed by standard northern blot hybridization. DNA fragments obtained during selective RT–PCR amplification of RNA3 were cloned and sequenced. Finally, the results obtained with our new mixed homologous recombination system were compared with analogous data previously got using the heteromolecular system (33) (see Table 1 and Figure 3).Homologous recombination in the mixed homo–heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSThe data presented in Table 1 indicate that the exchange of MagH-RNA3 (carrying a single RAS1) into MatH-RNA3 (bearing two RAS1 sequences) did not affect the infectivity of the BMV mutants. The average numbers of lesions appearing on the leaves inoculated with MH- and MatH-BMV were similar: 18 and 17, respectively. Interestingly, although RAS1 did not support homologous crossovers in the heteromolecular system represented by MH-BMV, it was very active in the mixed system. About 85% of the local lesions developed during MatH-BMV infection accumulated the RNA3 recombinant instead of parental MatH-RNA3. In all of them, one RAS1 and a spacer were deleted. This indicates that crossovers occurred either within 3′ end 5′RAS1 present in MatH-RNA3 (inter- or intramolecular crossovers) or within RAS1 and 5′RAS1 located in wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3, respectively. Recombinant junction sites were placed in identical regions; therefore, their location could not be precisely established.Homologous recombination in the mixed homo–heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSThe data presented till now also could not answer which molecules, exclusively MatH-RNA3 or wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3, participated in recombination. In the heteromolecular system, only RAS1-mediated crossovers between wtRNA1 and MagH-RNA3 were permitted. The situation seems to be more complicated in the mixed homologous system where three copies of RAS1 are present, all in sense orientation: two of them in MatH-RNA3 (3′RAS1 and 5′RAS1) and one in wtRNA1. Consequently, RAS1-mediated homologous recombination may happen according to four different scenarios (Figure 3). It can engage MatH-RNA3 only and occur as intra- or intermolecular process or it can involve wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3. In the latter case, recombination can be mediated by RAS1 present in wtRNA1 and either 5′- or 3′RAS1 located in MatH-RNA3.Homologous recombination in the mixed homo–heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSTo learn according to which scenario homologous recombination occurred, we checked whether mutation ΔXho introduced into MatH-RNA3 (just behind 3′RAS1) is still present in RNA3 recombinants. In this way, we were able to determine if their 3′-UTR was derived from MatH-RNA3 or wtRNA1 molecules. The undertaken analysis revealed that the mutation was present in ∼20% of recombinants. This result suggested that homologous crossovers preferentially occur between wtRNA1 and MatH-RNA3.Homologous recombination in the mixed homo–heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSHowever, there are other explanations why ΔXho was absent in a large fraction of recombinants. It is possible that the mutation was removed either from MatH-RNA3, due to homologous recombination between its 3′RAS1 and wtRNA1, or from the RNA3 recombinant (carrying a single copy of RAS1) because it could also have recombined with wtRNA1. To examine the first possibility, progeny RNA3 extracted from the local lesions accumulating MatH-RNA3 (lesions in which recombinant was not generated) was analyzed. About 800 nt RT–PCR products obtained during selective amplification of RNA3's 3′-portion were cloned and sequenced. In all of 20 analyzed clones ΔXho was present. To test the second possibility, a full-length cDNA clone of RNA3 recombinant containing ΔXho (RNA3-ΔXhoR) was obtained. It was inserted into the pUC19 vector under the T7 polymerase promoter. The resultant plasmid named pRNA3-ΔXhoR was used after linearization to produce an infectious RNA3-ΔXhoR molecule by in vitro transcription. Then, RNA3-ΔXhoR was used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to inoculate C.quinoa plants. After 2 weeks, total RNA was extracted from individual lesions and a 3′-portion of the progeny RNA3 was amplified by RT–PCR. Obtained products were cloned and sequenced. As described previously, ΔXho was present in all of the analyzed 20 clones. These two experiments proved that homologous recombination between either 3′RAS1 of MatH-RNA3 or RAS1 present in RNA3 recombinant and wtRNA1 does not occur frequently enough to explain why most recombinants lack ΔXho. Altogether, these results supported our initial thesis that ΔXho was removed from 80% of homologous recombinants, since most of the crossovers occurred within 5′RAS1 from MatH-RNA3 and RAS1 from wtRNA1.Non-homologous recombination in the mixed homo-heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSEarlier we showed that RAS1 can effectively support non-homologous recombination if inserted into PN0-RNA3 in antisense orientation (30,33). The heteromolecular system used in our experiment was composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and Mag1-RNA3 (M1-BMV mutant). Crossovers occurred within the local double-stranded region (local heteroduplex), which wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3 were capable of forming. In order to test RAS1 activity in the mixed non-homologous recombination system, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with the MatNH-BMV mutant (its genome is composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and MatNH-RNA3). Two weeks later progeny RNA3 were analyzed as described above. The number of lesions developed on each leaf was counted and total RNA was extracted from individual local lesions. After RT–PCR amplification, the 3′-portion of BMV RNA3 accumulating in each lesion was analyzed in an agarose gel, cloned and sequenced. The presence of recombinants was confirmed by a standard Northern blot. The results obtained were compared with analogous data we had got using the heteromolecular system (30) (Table 1 and Figure 4).Non-homologous recombination in the mixed homo-heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSAs described previously, we observed that the exchange of Mag1-RNA3 (with a single RAS1as sequence) for MatNH-RNA3 (with two sequences: RAS1as and RAS1s) did not influence the infectivity of the BMV mutants. The average numbers of lesions developed on each leaf during infection with M1-BMV and MatNH-BMV were 19 and 18, respectively. There was also no difference between the recombination activity of M1-BMV and MatNH-BMV. RAS-1 (in fact RAS1s and RAS1as) supported non-homologous recombination equally in both systems. Recombination events occurred with a similar frequency (100 and 95% for M1- and MatNH-BMV, respectively) and recombinant junction sites were located within the same region of the heteroduplexes, which recombining molecules were capable of forming.Non-homologous recombination in the mixed homo-heteromolecular system ::: RESULTSIn the heteromolecular system, only one type of heteroduplex supporting non-homologous crossovers could possibly form: between wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3. In the mixed system, recombining molecules were capable of forming three types of heteroduplexes: (i) intermolecular, between 5′RAS1as from MatNH-RNA3 and RAS1s from wtRNA1, (ii) intermolecular, between 5′RAS1as and 3′RAS1s located in two MatHN-RNA3 molecules and (iii) intramolecular, between 5′RAS1as and 3′RAS1s located in the same MatNH-RNA3 molecule (Figure 4). To determine the molecules that participated in non-homologous recombination, the RT–PCR amplified 3′-portions of RNA3 were checked for ΔXho. It was present in 90% of recombinants. This result clearly showed that non-homologous crossovers almost always involve one (intramolecular recombination) or two (intermolecular recombination) MatNH-RNA3 molecules.The universal BMV RNA3-based recombination vector ::: RESULTSThe results presented above indicated that the homomolecular system can provide new interesting data concerning the mechanism of RNA recombination, especially if it could be used for testing the recombination activity of RNA sequences derived from other RNA-based viruses. Consequently, we attempted to construct a universal BMV RNA3-based recombination vector called Mat0-RNA3 (for details see Materials and Methods and Figure 5A). In Mat0-RNA3, as in the former PN0-RNA3 vector, only 3′-UTR was modified. It is composed of the 295 nt very 3′ end of RNA1 followed by the 3′ RAS cloning site, a 338 nt spacer and the 5′ RAS cloning site.The universal BMV RNA3-based recombination vector ::: RESULTSTo determine the infectivity and stability of the new vector, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with a mixture containing wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and Mat0-RNA3 (Mat0-BMV mutant). After 2 weeks, the number of lesions developed on inoculated leaves was counted and then standard analysis of progeny RNA was carried out. Twenty separate lesions were excised, the total RNA was isolated and used for the selective RT–PCR amplification of the 3′-portion of progeny RNA3. The length of RT–PCR products was established by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. In addition, reaction products were cloned and sequenced. This demonstrated that the Mat0-BMV mutant is infectious (usually 20 lesions were developed on each leaf, see Table 2) and Mat0-RNA3 is stable during the whole period of infection and thus it can be used as a recombination vector.Practical application of Mat0-RNA3 vector ::: RESULTSIn order to demonstrate that Mat0-RNA3 can be used as an effective tool in recombination studies, we applied it to examine the recombination activity of two specific sequences derived from the HCV genome. The first, 101 nt sequence is placed within the 5′-portion of the HCV genome (within the fragment encoding E2 protein) and is named HVR (40,42). The second, called the sequence X (X) constitutes a 98 nt 3′ end of HCV genomic RNA. It has been shown that X represents the most conservative fragment of HCV genome (43). Both sequences were obtained by a standard RT–PCR method involving viral RNA isolated from the blood of infected patients as a template (40,41). Amplified fragments were inserted into the 5′-cloning site of Mat0-RNA3 in two different orientations (sense and antisense), then only in sense orientation into the 3′-cloning site (for details see Materials and Methods). As a result, four different Mat0-RNA3 derivatives were generated: (i) MatH-HVR-RNA3, possessing two copies of HVR in sense orientation (3′ and 5′HVRs); (ii) MatH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X in sense orientation (3′ and 5′Xs); (iii) MatNH-HVR-RNA3, with two copies of HVR, the 3′-copy in sense and the 5′ in antisense orientation (3′HVRs and 5′HVRas); (iv) MatNH-X-RNA3, with two copies of X located in different orientation (3′Xs and 5′Xas) (Figure 5B). The former two were applied to test HVR's and X's ability to support homologous crossovers while the latter two to examine Xs/Xas' and HVRs/HVRas' capacity to induce non-homologous, heteroduplex-mediated recombination. Unlike previously tested mutants (MatNH- and MatH-BMV), in MatH-HVR-, MatNH-HVR-, MatH-X- and MatNH-X-BMV, the examined sequences were present only in the recombination vector. They were absent in the two other genomic RNAs, so that recombination crossovers could involve only RNA3 molecules.Practical application of Mat0-RNA3 vector ::: RESULTSTo determine the recombination activity of HCV-derived sequences, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with four BMV mutants: MatH-HVR-BMV, MatNH-HVR-BMV, MatH-X-BMV and MatNH-X-BMV. Their genomes were composed of wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and one of the newly generated Mat0-RNA3 derivatives (either MatH-HVR-, MatNH-HVR-, MatH-X- or MatNH-X-RNA3) (Table 2). After 2 weeks, the standard procedure of BMV RNA3 progeny analysis was applied. The number of lesions developed during each infection was counted. The 3′-portion of progeny RNA3 was amplified by the RT–PCR method. The length of RT–PCR products was established (by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel), then they were cloned and sequenced.Practical application of Mat0-RNA3 vector ::: RESULTSWe found that BMV mutants carrying HVRs/HVRs and HVRs/HVRas sequences are as infectious as Mat0-BMV; usually they developed 14–18 lesions on each inoculated leaf. The two others, MatH-X- and MatNH-X-BMV mutants, are visibly less infectious and developed 3–5 and 4–8 lesions/leaf, respectively. Despite differences in their infectivity, BMV mutants carrying 3′HVRs and 5′HVRas as well as 3′Xs and 5′Xas supported non-homologous, heteroduplex-mediated crossovers very efficiently. An RNA3 recombinant was generated in 100 and 90% of lesions developed during infection with MatNH-HVR- and MatNH-X-BMV, respectively. Recombinant junction sites were located within the left portion of the local double-stranded region that could potentially be formed either by HVRs and HVRas or by Xs and Xas. As a result, both sequences supporting non-homologous crossovers were almost entirely deleted, together with the whole spacer (Figure 5D and E).Practical application of Mat0-RNA3 vector ::: RESULTSInterestingly, homologous recombinants were generated only during infection involving MatH-HVR-BMV. Fifty-five percent of analyzed lesions contained the RNA3 recombinant. In all sequenced recombinants, one HVR and the spacer were deleted (Figure 5C). Their 3′-UTR was composed of a 295 nt RNA1-derived sequence and HVRs followed by the CP coding region. All lesions developed on plants infected with MatH-X-BMV accumulated parental MatH-X-RNA3 molecules only.Practical application of Mat0-RNA3 vector ::: RESULTSThe presence of homologous and non-homologous recombinants in the examined lesions was always confirmed not only by RT–PCR but also by northern blot analysis (Figure 6). This revealed the same tendency as that observed earlier using the heteromolecular system (30,33). BMV accumulated to a very low level in lesions containing parental RNA3 (original molecules with duplicated sequences—Figure 6A, lane 5 and Figure 6B, lane 2). However, this changed in lesions where a recombinant was generated (Figure 6A, lanes 1–4 and Figure 6B, lanes 1 and 3).Recombination in the homo- and heteromolecular systems ::: DISCUSSIONEarlier it was shown that the BMV-based heteromolecular system can be used as an effective tool for investigating the mechanism of homologous and non-homologous recombination, although it is only suitable for testing the recombination activity of the sequences derived from the 3′-portion of BMV RNA1 or RNA2 (30,33). To overcome this problem, we attempted to create a new universal recombination in vivo system. The collected data suggested that a BMV RNA3-based homomolecular system would best fulfill our expectations. To confirm the correctness of the above presumption, to determine the efficacy of the homomolecular system and to compare it with the heteromolecular one, two mixed homo–heteromolecular systems were constructed—one to study homologous (MatH-BMV) and the other non-homologous (MatNH-BMV) recombination.Recombination in the homo- and heteromolecular systems ::: DISCUSSIONThe mixed systems were prepared in such a way that two identical or two complementary sequences were capable of supporting homologous or non-homologous crossovers, respectively, either between molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (modified RNA3) or between molecules representing two different segments of the BMV genome (wtRNA1 and modified RNA3). Experiments involving MatH- and MatNH-BMV showed that recombination can occur both in homo- and heteromolecular systems and proved that the former should be at least as effective as the previously utilized heteromolecular one. Interestingly, the RAS1s sequence did not support homologous recombination during infection with MH-BMV (heteromolecular system) and it was quite active in the mixed system. This clearly demonstrates that not only primary and secondary structure but also the location of RAS within the viral genome affects its ability to mediate homologous crossovers. The undertaken experiments also revealed that homologous recombination occurs more often between two different RNAs (RNA1 and RNA3), while non-homologous recombination usually involves molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (RNA3). The obtained results constitute yet another piece of evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different. The same conclusion was reached by us earlier while studying the influence of specific mutations in BMV-encoded protein 2a (26,27). We identified among other the mutation in the 2a protein, which inhibits non-homologous crossovers without affecting the frequency of homologous ones.Recombination in the homo- and heteromolecular systems ::: DISCUSSIONAt present, it is difficult to judge at which stage of the recombination process the observed differences occur. One can only suppose that the structural requirements of transfer of the replicase-nascent strand complex from the donor to the acceptor molecule must be different in homologous and non-homologous recombination. In the case of the former, a basic factor facilitating this process is complementarity between the acceptor and the nascent strand. Consequently, there is no necessity for the replication complex to be stable during homologous crossovers (22). Replicase can leave the donor template alone or together with a nascent strand. Then, the 3′ end of the newly synthesized RNA molecule can function as a guide; it can find a complementary sequence in the acceptor RNA, hybridize and serve as a primer allowing viral replicase to reinitiate RNA synthesis. In non-homologous heteroduplex-mediated recombination, a factor enhancing crossover seems to be the interaction between the donor and the acceptor (the formation of a local double-stranded region) (30,33). Considering that BMV genomic RNAs are copied within spherules (44), intramolecular hybridization between RAS1s and RAS1as, located in MatNH-RNA3, is much more likely. Thus, the results presented here indicate that the way the virus replicates can strongly affect the recombination process. However, further detailed studies are necessary in order to explain this phenomenon.Recombination in the universal homomolecular system ::: DISCUSSIONBased on results obtained using the heteromolecular (30,33) and mixed systems, we constructed a new homomolecular one. Its most crucial element is the Mat0-RNA3 vector, into which both tested sequences can be introduced. In order to show the usefulness of this system, we employed it to test the recombination activity of two distinctly different sequences deriving from the genome of an RNA virus not related to BMV. Our choice was the 98 nt sequence X and an HVR both from HCV genome. There are many reasons as to why the two sequences can be deemed drastically different. The most important of them are (i) sequence X is placed in a non-coding region, while HVR in a coding one, (ii) sequence X is the least variable and HVR the most variable fragment of the HCV genome (42,43,45), (iii) unlike to HVR, sequence X possesses a very stable and well-defined secondary and tertiary structure (42,45).Recombination in the universal homomolecular system ::: DISCUSSIONWe ascertained that the introduction of HVR into the Mat0-RNA3 vector (in sense/sense and antisense/sense orientation) does not influence BMV infectivity. The latter was, however, reduced if HVR was replaced with sequence X. We found that HVR supports homologous recombination and HVRs and its complementary counterpart HVRas mediate non-homologous crossovers. The frequency of homologous recombination amounted to 55% and of non-homologous to 100%. Sequence Xs did not support homologous crossovers but Xs and complementary sequence Xas were capable of inducing non-homologous ones (their frequency reaching 90%).Recombination in the universal homomolecular system ::: DISCUSSIONThe obtained results testify that the local double-stranded structures induce non-homologous recombination crossovers very efficiently. This may reflect the capacity of RNA viruses to remove inverted repeats from their genomes. Viruses lacking such ability would be an easy target for double-stranded RNA-induced RNA silencing, which is known as the plant antiviral mechanism (46). Moreover, the data presented suggest that sequence X, which adopts a very compact and stable structure (45), is not able to mediate homologous recombination. It occurs efficiently within AU-rich HVR sequences whose structure is more labile and dynamic (42). Earlier research on homologous recombination in BMV led to similar conclusions. It was shown that homologous recombination occurs effectively in AU-rich regions (47) and is not observed within highly structured 3′- and 5′-UTR (48). These observations concur with the proposed mechanism of homologous RNA recombination (22). It assumes that AU-rich regions facilitate the detachment of the polymerase-nascent strand complex from donor RNA. On the other hand, it is thought that the stability of RNA structure makes the hybridization of the nascent strand and/or replicase to the acceptor difficult.Recombination in the universal homomolecular system ::: DISCUSSIONCurrently, it is becoming increasingly clear that RNA recombination plays a very complex role in a virus' life cycle. Not only does it permit the exchange of genetic material between viruses (3,4,22), frequent homologous crossovers between molecules representing the same segment of the virus genome also stabilize genetic information (48). Moreover, here we showed that homologous and non-homologous recombination might control the organization of the virus genome by removing direct or inverted repeats, which affect the virus' ability to replicate or accumulate in the infected cells. Interestingly, we observed that complementary sequences are more effectively deleted than homologous ones. It seems that some of the latter can prevail in the viral genome probably due to their compact stable structure that prevents recombination events.Recombination in the universal homomolecular system ::: DISCUSSIONAltogether, the data presented here prove that the newly created BMV-based homomolecular recombination system can be used to examine in vivo recombination activity of various RNA sequences derived from the genomes of related or unrelated viruses. However, there are other factors which, in addition to RNA structure, can affect the course of the studied process. Specific properties of the viral replicase and the host proteins that are necessary for recombination events can be of equally great importance. Therefore, there is a need to create similar universal recombination systems in other viruses. We believe that these systems will be very helpful in finding some general rules in RNA recombination and will provide us with knowledge which is indispensable to understand how new RNA viruses or retroviruses are generated."
Engendering enthusiasm for sustainable disaster critical care response: why this is of consequence to critical care professionals?,"Disasters have been a part of human existence since ancient times, and so has disaster medicine [1]. We define disaster medicine as a human response to unexpected mayhem, with the intent to limit death, disease, and injury. In recent decades, disaster medical response has largely focused on prehospital care issues such as casualty evacuation, triage, and transport, without specific emphasis on hospital management. In the United States, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere'. Recent experiences with large-scale disasters have strongly reinforced the fact that hospital capacity is the major rate-limiting factor in the chain of medical response. This is especially true for critical care services and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity [2]. As we continue working to build adequate disaster medical response systems we must maintain our prehospital readiness efforts, and we must expand our focus to more precisely define the hospital and the ICU as critical links in the entire response process. The purpose of the present commentary is to explore ways in which this expansion of focus might be conceived.A number of recent examples illustrate the importance of the hospital and the ICU in the medical response to disaster. Within a few hours of the Madrid bombing explosions in March 2004, 27 critically ill patients were admitted to the two closest hospitals, which had a maximum ICU capacity of 28 beds, most of which were already occupied [3]. After the terrorist bombing in Bali, the Royal Darwin Hospital in Australia, with a capacity to care for a maximum of 12 ventilated patients, was presented with 20 critically ill patients, 15 of whom required mechanical ventilation [4]. Flooding due to heavy rain in June 2001 crippled the Texas Medical Center in Houston, and resulted in a sudden loss of 75% of the ICU bed capacity for a county of 4 million people [5]. And it is not just ICU bed capacity that is subject to being overwhelmed. Damage to the physical and organizational structure of the hospital may wipe out an entire critical care infrastructure. Some disasters may harm healthcare workers, thus limiting available ICU personnel. This was the case during the Tokyo Sarin gas subway attack in 1995, and more recently during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Canada and Asia [6].Viewed in the context of the everyday strain on our currently available resources, the challenge is even greater [7]. An analysis of the capacity of a 1200-bed hospital in the United States to handle patients in the setting of a toxic chemical exposure event revealed an ability to handle only two chemically contaminated patients at a time [8]. Add to this the fact that in many countries, because of efficiency and budgetary constraints, hospitals are shrinking in capacity. This has resulted in hospitals working at or near maximum capacity every day, with associated logistical concerns such as overcrowding, diversion of ambulance services, and lack of surge capacity. Particularly important is the inability of emergency departments to move critically ill patients to their inpatient setting [9] due to the unavailability of staffed critical care beds. With future projections for a shortage of critical care physicians [10] and critical care nurses [11,12], these logistical barriers to ICU care will persist [13] and will influence the provision of disaster critical care response.Taken together, this means that we do not need a major disaster like a terrorist attack or an emerging infectious disease epidemic to tip the strained balance between the supply and demand of critical care resources. Disasters of a local scale alone can tip the balance, such as when a fire broke out at a nightclub in Rhode Island in 2003. The local hospital immediately received 40 critically-ill patients, most requiring intensive care support [14].Education and training are effective modalities that tangibly enhance disaster medical response at every level. However, current disaster medical education programs for healthcare professionals are not coordinated in scope and content, and may not address the most pressing needs for critical care personnel. What are the imperatives that must be taught? For example, it would be an error to assume that principles of triage, recognition of smallpox, antibiotics for anthrax, proper dosing of atropine, and so forth, represent a sufficient knowledge base. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2003 emphatically demonstrated that scrupulous training and execution of infection control practices became a survival skill for ICU personnel. Unfortunately, this is not substantially represented in our current disaster medical education programs.Does this mean we need to build more beds, hire additional specialized personnel, or stockpile antibiotics, antidotes, and equipment against a possible disaster situation? We think not; this would be unworkably expensive and would still leave us incompletely prepared for many of the disaster scenarios just described. So, what are the solutions? We offer the following suggestions in order of priority. These concepts attempt to build on existing resources. We do not pretend to offer evidence-based guidelines. Rather, our intention is to engender discussion and dialog.Education and trainingPre-emptive education is the single most effective tool we can employ to mitigate the future effects of a disaster. In terms of impact, the education of healthcare professionals is at the top of the list [15]. The educational initiatives we propose to accomplish this goal are as follows: heightened disaster response awareness, enhanced skill sets, understanding of roles and responsibilities, alternate communication methods, self-preservation training, and experience in how to cooperate and coordinate during mayhem.Education and trainingMedical preparedness training should not be limited to first-line treatment, but must include targeted training that covers the entire disaster medical spectrum [16]. The challenge is distilling all of this into a curriculum that fits the very limited time availability of healthcare professionals. As one evolving example, the Society of Critical Care Medicine has developed a standardized and highly concentrated course (Fundamentals of Disaster Management) to equip critical care professionals with basic but essential disaster medical knowledge. The content of this program is still in evolution.Education and trainingDisaster response medical simulation approximating actual scenarios enables disaster planners and responders to test procedures and technologies, and to incorporate the lessons learned from past disasters [17]. This simulation has been shown to be effective [16,18]. The level of realism is much higher than in facility-based exercises, where time and personnel utilization are compressed and usually do not adequately teach disaster resource management.Education and trainingFinally, there is a useful role for what is termed 'just-in-time training'. The intent of these programs is to make concise knowledge available to providers, at the time of an event and at the point of care. Most of these are Web-based knowledge collections that can be queried. This approach is less time intensive, less labor intensive, and less cost intensive than traditional educational processes. We should point out, however, that 'just-in-time training' serves as an adjunct, but alone it is not an adequate replacement for the other methods enumerated here. Any 'just-in-time training' program is only as effective as the skills of the professional in accessing the training when it is needed, which must be in place beforehand.Interfacility cooperationExperience has shown that the burden of disaster medical response largely falls to healthcare facilities proximate to an event. Despite the widely held impression that 'the government will be there', outside help and intervention typically does not have a large impact on the initial phases of disaster medical response. We have already outlined some of the obstacles, such as strained resources or lack of communication and training, that impede cooperation. While most hospitals have plans for response to local disasters mapped out, plans that looked good on paper often go awry during execution [19]. In terms of interfacility cooperation, given that many local hospitals financially compete with each other, teamwork in the event of a disaster is expected to materialize where it has not been previously encouraged. As such, the results are seldom efficient.Interfacility cooperationA rational approach to tackle this issue includes the development of flexible and scalable plans for interchanging resources to augment the existing capacity of individual hospitals [20]. For example, many communities currently divide disaster responsibilities according to the type and severity of injuries among the various hospitals. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of casualties make their own way to the hospital, irrespective of these plans. A better way would be to build flexible surge capacity that allows hospital personnel to move from one facility to another according to need. Such adaptation to circumstances will not happen spontaneously, and will require significant pre-planning. An additional example of efficient sharing is disaster medical education; many or all of the educational proposals outlined in the previous section could be shared, increasing availability, cost-effectiveness and, probably, quality.Dual usage of resourcesAs we have suggested, the cost of effective disaster planning is enormous. It is not realistic to expect budget-constrained facilities to absorb these additional costs, and yet relief from governments will not fill the gap. It therefore seems reasonable to seek economies of scale, such as dual-use modalities. For example, to increase ICU surge capacity, consider our ability to provide critical care outside of a designated geographical location. A significant volume of critical care is provided (nondeliberately) every day outside the geographical constraints of an ICU, hence the growing development of medical emergency teams in hospitals around the world [21]. With little additional training, these teams could provide a highly effective adjunctive capability during disaster medical response when critical care units are full but additional ICU services are required.Dual usage of resourcesAs a second example, ensuring patient safety in the hospital is also emerging as a significant resource-consuming, but essential, activity [22]. This is especially true as we move beyond compliance activities into multidisciplinary, tiered accident and error prevention. From this perspective, a medical catastrophe may encompass a single patient who receives improper medication through to mass casualty circumstances. While these events are fundamentally different in scope, magnitude, and cause, they share at their core a need for accurate and complete planning and education to prevent or mitigate their consequences. Is there sufficient overlap to merge some of the planning, education, and practice of hospital patient safety and disaster medical response?Dual usage of resourcesIn summary, where we have been will not get us to where we need to go for disaster critical care response. First, we must work around apathy, confusion of purpose, and a lack of monetary resources to widen the spotlight of disaster medical response from the prehospital arena to include the hospital. We must enhance our abilities and capacity across the whole spectrum of disaster medical response.Dual usage of resourcesThese efforts are the responsibility of society as a whole. All involved organizations including hospitals, emergency medical services, fire services, police, the public health system, local municipalities and government authorities, and other health care institutions will need to integrate into a well-developed disaster educational system and response team [23]. In the present article we have attempted to outline conceptual elements that may facilitate some of this integration. For this to happen, someone with comprehensive understanding and the necessary expertise is required nationally, regionally, and locally to provide the leadership imperative that drives integration of these disparate entities and resources. The first step is ownership, and as critical care professionals we are obliged to step forward and provide the leadership for these processes.AbbreviationsICU = intensive care unit.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Biochip sensors for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral disease,"In 2003, China took measures to contain an outbreak of 'flu-like illness' [1]; when the same disease (which came to be called severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) began to appear in other countries, the World Health Organization initiated a global response [2]. This incident highlighted, on a world stage, the need for rapid and accurate techniques for pathogen identification. Failure to have such tools puts lives at risk by severely hampering containment and effective vaccination strategies.Over the past few decades, the identification and characterization of infectious agents has been refined and improved, resulting in highly sensitive and precise methodologies that will soon be able to measure individual molecules. This sensitivity comes at a cost, however, in terms of time, complexity of assay, and robustness of measurements, and this can have a negative impact on patient care. The prognosis for the majority of serious infections is vastly improved by early intervention, so the development of rapid detection and identification methods is essential, but this must not come at the expense of sensitivity. In the case of hepatitis C infection, for example, diagnosis needs low levels of virus to be detected [3], and this demands a high level of assay sensitivity. For these reasons there is an ever-increasing requirement for rapid, sensitive technologies that provide better diagnosis and clinical management of infectious diseases. In an effort to address that need, modern medicine has seen a revolution in new high-throughput approaches. Advances in genomics, microarrays and imaging technologies, in particular, have revolutionized the way in which infectious-disease problems are being addressed. Here, we briefly examine how such technologies are being applied to the detection and identification of viruses and the impact such systems might have in the clinic.DNA and protein microarray approachesUntil recently, virus detection and identification in the clinical setting has been centered around immunological or PCR-based techniques. One of the primary immunological techniques is the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of circulating virus-specific antibodies. By contrast, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR is used to detect the presence of viral genomes or specific viral genes. A combined approach using both techniques overcomes detection problems when either the infection produces a weak antibody response or when virus-specific transcripts are in low abundance. Both these approaches have well documented limitations, however. Immunological tests are hampered by the need for specific antisera that are both laborious and time-consuming to produce, whereas PCR, while being a definite advance in sensitive virus detection, is prone to failure and false recordings and is limited in its ability to identify multiple viruses simultaneously [4]. We therefore need a rapid, sensitive approach that is capable of identifying multiple viruses in parallel; this need is being addressed by the development of DNA and protein microarrays specifically designed for virus detection and identification.DNA and protein microarray approachesThe basic design principle is the same for all forms of microarray, whether based on DNA, protein or cells. Specific molecular 'targets' are detected simultaneously within the sample of interest by an array of 'probes'. The probes, often numbering thousands, are chemically attached in an array format to a solid substrate to construct either a DNA or a protein microarray (Figure 1). But the microarray concept is not limited to the use of just DNA or protein probes. Indeed, in recent years the concept has been greatly expanded to include the production of all manner of arrayed probes: cells, glycans and carbohydrates, to name but a few. The significance of the microarray to the field of infectious diseases is the parallel detection capabilities of the system (covered in more detail in [5]). Microarrays offer the ability to achieve simultaneous detection of many targets, and through optimization this can be achieved without detriment to sensitivity.DNA and protein microarray approachesDNA microarrays for viral analysis can be divided into viral chips and host chips, and each can be applied not only to detection and identification but also to the monitoring of viral populations. In 1999, we and colleagues [6] described the first viral DNA microarray for the temporal profiling of viral (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV) gene expression. Treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide or ganciclovir was used to block de novo protein synthesis or viral replication, respectively, and the microarray was then used to generate expression profiles of the viral genes represented on the chip. Using this approach, HCMV genes were assigned to immediate-early, early or late expression classes, depending on their expression profile in response to the drug treatments. If the expression profile is sufficiently unique, it can be used as an identifying hybridization signature for the molecular staging of an infection.DNA and protein microarray approachesWe described the idea of unique hybridization patterns being used for the identification of viral inhibitors [6], and in 2002 this idea was applied by Wang et al. [4] to the detection and identification of viruses. The authors [4] described the use of viral DNA microarrays to produce hybridization signatures of viral sequences that effectively serve as 'viral barcodes' for the identification of known, related or novel viruses. By taking advantage of the highly conserved regions within gene families, the authors were able to produce an array that could identify related viruses and discriminate between serotypes. The ability to distinguish subtypes is critical to effective infection management in the clinic: variola virus, for example, is an orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox and has two subtypes, variola major and variola minor, of differing pathogenicity. Laassri et al. [7] addressed the problem of orthopoxvirus subtype discrimination by producing an array capable of correctly identifying four of the orthopoxvirus species. Similarly, arrays have been developed for the detection and distinction of hantaviruses [8] and are capable of distinguishing between isolates that have up to 90% sequence similarity. Other groups have focused on the genotyping of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza [9,10].DNA and protein microarray approachesThe ability to monitor the divergence of virus strains is critical for maintaining the effectiveness of current vaccines and ensuring the safety of vaccines that use live, attenuated viruses. Cherkasova et al. [11] have demonstrated the use of oligonucleotide microarrays in the analysis of vaccine-derived polioviruses. They describe two chip-based approaches. The 'microarrays for resequencing and sequence heterogeneity' (MARSH) method uses probes with overlapping sequences from within the coding region of the gene for the poliovirus structural polypeptide VP1 to detect point mutations that have occurred and to determine regions of differing genome stability. By contrast, the 'microarray analysis of viral recombination' (MAVR) method can detect recombination events within virus strains by analyzing patterns of hybridization to probes unique to specific virus strains. Used in combination these chips provide a rapid genotype profile.DNA and protein microarray approachesViral chips provide a unique signature derived from the viral transcriptome or genome alone. An alternative approach is to examine the host response: changes in host gene expression provide a molecular signature of infection, an idea explored by Cummings and Relman [12]. The availability of commercial chips covering the whole host genome, from companies such as Affymetrix, allows genome-wide changes to be examined. Alternatively, smaller customized host chips can be constructed with a more restricted number of probes. One of the first groups to adopt this approach identified 258 cellular mRNAs whose level changed by a factor of four or greater before the onset of HCMV DNA replication [13]. Later, Domachowske et al. [14] examined pneumovirus strain differences and their ability to induce antiviral inflammation, and van't Wout et al. [15] examined HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells to identify changes in host gene expression that were specific to HIV infection and that did not occur in cells that had been heat shocked, treated with interferon or infected with influenza A virus. Host gene signatures identified included pro-inflammatory genes and genes involved in endoplasmic-reticulum stress pathways, the cell cycle and apoptosis. A cardinal signature and common molecular thread for all infections appears to be the markers in the interferon pathway.DNA and protein microarray approachesMicroarray applications such as those described above offer an accurate, rapid and sensitive method for the detection and identification of viruses, but they have important limitations that should be considered. The production of robust unique hybridization signatures - viral barcodes - which can be used to correctly identify a viral infection depends on a number of influencing variables. For example, signatures may be altered dramatically according to variations in the viral load, the stage of infection or the tissues sampled. Obtaining the DNA for hybridization could also be problematic for some infections: infected tissues may be inaccessible and could yield little nucleic acid.DNA and protein microarray approachesProtein arrays can also be constructed for the detection and identification of viruses. Viral antigens can be arrayed and used to detect serum antibodies, or antibodies can be arrayed and used to detect pathogens. Bacarese-Hamilton et al. [16] applied protein microarrays to the detection of antibodies to the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV and herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) type 1 and 2. Antigens were arrayed and used to detect serum immunoglobins IgG and IgM down to 0.5 pg, and the system was validated by comparison with existing ELISAs. The results showed 80% agreement between ELISA and array, and confirmed that smaller reagent and sample volumes are used by the array. They also highlighted the advantage of the array's internal calibration curve: by processing the calibration curve on the array and not in separate tubes, as is done in ELISA, matrix effects that are known to bias ELISAs were reduced.DNA and protein microarray approachesOnce constructed, protein arrays can be air-dried and easily stored at room temperature [17]; their production and use are readily automated and they offer a cost-effective alternative to ELISAs. In contrast to DNA arrays, protein arrays cannot provide a readout of global changes in protein expression, since extensive libraries of globally expressed proteins simply do not exist [18]. It is still possible, however, to generate protein analyte 'signatures' by using a specific selection of targeted proteins. For instance, cytokine responses to viral infection can vary greatly between viruses; by arraying antibodies to a spectrum of cytokines it is possible to generate a 'cytokine signature' of infection that is readily identifiable. The application of such technology to the clinic would, however, require a concerted effort to characterize and collate such cytokine signatures. Considering that each signature is subject to a number of variables, each of which can produce a significantly different output, establishing a catalog of viral identifiers that are consistently accurate would be no mean feat.Cell-based detectionDespite the rapidity and sensitivity offered by systems that use microarray detection and identification, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to engineer cell-based systems that outstrip microarrays in terms of speed of detection. Rider et al. [19] demonstrated the use of engineered B cells capable of detecting pathogens within 3 minutes (Figure 2). Their CANARY sensor (cellular analysis and notification of antigen risks and yields) comprises B cells that express the calcium-dependent bioluminescent protein aequorin together with membrane-bound pathogen-specific antibodies. Binding of the pathogen to the cell-surface antibodies triggers an elevation in intracellular calcium ions that in turn causes the aequorin to emit light, all within a matter of seconds. One of the engineered B-cell lines described by the authors could detect spores of Bacillus anthracis, a pathogen already feared by the general public in relation to terror attacks, highlighting the relevance of such a technique. These investigators [19] used naturally occurring pattern-recognition molecules - antibodies - but such systems are by no means restricted to the natural world; for instance, Golumbfskie et al. [20] have investigated the possibility of developing synthetic systems capable of specific recognition between polymers and surfaces. Such biomimetic approaches may have future applications in both cell-based and microarray sensor technologies.Cell-based detectionMore recently, Perlman et al. [21], have described multidimensional drug profiling by automated microscopy. The authors used automated microscopy to create profiles, analogous to those generated by microarray data, of changes in cellular phenotype resulting from drug treatment; the profiles could then be used to categorize various unknown drugs [21]. This cell-array technique should complement existing technology and allow rapid, cost-effective collection of data or individual cellular responses. Although the results are in the context of drug treatments, one can easily imagine the application of such a technique to the detection of infectious diseases. A system such as this, capable of creating profiles based on phenotypic changes in individual cells, would be a powerful tool. This technology illustrates how the ability to measure changes at the molecular level can allow us to turn individual cells into sensors.'Cell-omic' sensorsDespite the fact that microarray-based technologies are becoming increasingly rapid, cheap and ever more sensitive, there are still drawbacks. One approach to maximizing the effectiveness of existing technology is to combine complementary technologies (Figure 3). Microarrays provide the opportunity to develop a system whereby multiple viral infections can be identified in parallel by their hybridization signatures or 'viral barcodes'. Cellular systems, such as the light-emitting B cells engineered by the Rider group [19], while individually not having the parallel capabilities of the array, provide an extremely rapid detection system. In the future, therefore, we could see the production of hybrid technologies: 'cell-omic sensors', which have the parallel high-throughput capabilities of arrays coupled with the speed of the engineered B cells. This may take the form of microarrays constructed by arraying a panel of engineered cells, for instance, or even synthetic biomimetic systems. Alternatively, advances could allow arrays to be constructed that combine cellular sensors with gene or protein probes. It may be possible to take advantage of the immune system's natural pathogen sensors - macrophages or dendritic cells for example - arrayed onto protein probes or sensors of some description in such a way that cellular changes induced by contact with a pathogen can be measured in real time.'Cell-omic' sensorsThe goal of generating hybrid arrays of cells within arrays of protein probes is increasingly feasible with advances in science and technology. Ultimately it might be possible to engineer a 'microarray' within a cell, allowing real-time, continuous monitoring of complex signatures of infection. The goal of having an addressable array within a cell from which signals can be measured without perturbing cellular function may, for example, be enabled through the use of new nanomaterials that act as intermediaries between the biological system and the physical system used for measurement. Several types of nanomaterial, such as carbon nanotubes [22], gold nanoshells [23] and quantum dots [24], have unique electronic or optical properties that could be tuned to detect biomolecular concentrations within cells. In these examples, the nanomaterials may link with systems such as advanced silicon microelectronics or advanced imaging techniques such as fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) or Raman microscopy.'Cell-omic' sensorsThere is a strong need for rapid, sensitive pathogen-detection systems that can be easily applied to the clinic, industry or even the 'battlefield'. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the transition of these technologies from the bench to real-world application depends on certain requirements. A number of groups have produced array data that could be used to produce viral barcodes or unique identifiers. These efforts, whether at the DNA or protein level, are currently disparate, uncoordinated and mainly confined to studies in vitro. A collection of such infection profiles, an Infection Profile Database, for example, needs to be put together that sets out standards and requirements that would help such high-dimensional data to be translated into clinical utility. Indeed, such information would provide a valuable resource for constructing specific cell-based sensors or even synthetic sensors.'Cell-omic' sensorsOne of the overwhelming problems related to the creation of unique signatures that will consistently and accurately identify an infection is the fact that the signatures depend on a large number of variables. A potential solution might involve identifying a signature that is produced early in infection and yet can be sustained for capturing later. This idea is perhaps not too far-fetched, and it may well involve certain immune cells, in particular those destined to become antigen-driven memory cells. Although various responses can be used to identify an infection, the heterogeneity of the system we propose (Figure 3) may be too variable, and thus the detection of these responses would require all patients to present within a very narrow characterized window for their output to be informative. In clinical terms, this scenario is obviously completely unrealistic. The question is whether infections leave early footprints that are unique and readable, or whether the response to infection as a whole is simply too dynamic. Answers to these questions are tractable but will require carefully controlled and appropriately powered studies as well as standardization of data measurements and quality assurance. Increasing attention is being given to these critical areas, and as a consequence we are in exciting times in this rapidly moving field."
Peptide inhibitors of dengue virus and West Nile virus infectivity,"Enveloped viruses utilize membrane-bound fusion proteins to mediate attachment and entry into specific target host cells. During the virion assembly process, newly synthesized envelope proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus where initial folding and post-transcriptional processing occurs, including multimerization, glycosylation, and proteolysis. This initial folding and processing is required to achieve a conformation where the proteins are held in a metastable state prior to virion release. Post virion release, the multimeric envelope proteins are poised to undergo structural rearrangement leading to fusion of the virion and the new target cell lipid bilayer membranes. Depending on the virus system, the rearrangement trigger can take the form of specific receptor binding, multiple receptor binding, decreased pH following receptor mediated endocytosis, or a combination of triggers.IntroductionThe prototypic viral envelope fusion protein, the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, contains short alpha helical domains in the trimeric virion configuration. In response to receptor binding and decreased pH, the short helices rearrange with adjoining sequences to produce a longer helix, thus exposing an N-terminal fusion peptide that is believed to interact directly with the target cell membrane. This is followed by a hinge-like bending of the entire complex to adjoin and fuse the two lipid membranes [2,3]. The structural rearrangements that result in extrusion of the fusion peptide and subsequent collapse involve alterations in packing between regions both within individual fusion proteins as well as between monomeric subunits in the trimeric structures. Several disparate viruses, including arenaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and retroviruses, encode similar proteins that together are classified as class I fusion proteins. These class I viral fusion proteins vary in length and sequence, but are similar in overall structure [4,5].IntroductionQureshi et al. (1990) demonstrated that a peptide from one of the two extended helical domains of the HIV-1 transmembrane protein can block virion infectivity. Subsequently, the FDA approved anti-HIV-1 drug Fuzeon™ (aka DP178, T-20, enfuvirtide) and other N- and C-helix inhibitory peptides were developed [6,7]. These results have greatly motivated the search for other HIV-1 inhibitory peptides [8,9]. Additional peptide mimics of the fusion proteins of other retroviruses, and of orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses have also been identified and shown to inhibit viral entry [10-18]IntroductionThe envelope fusion proteins of several virus types, including the flaviviruses and alphaviruses, have a structure distinct from class I viral fusion proteins. The envelope glycoprotein (E) of the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) consists of three domains: a structurally central amino terminal domain (domain I), a dimerization domain (domain II) and a carboxyl terminal Ig-like domain (domain III), all containing predominantly beta sheet folds [19]. The primary sequence of E1, the fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus, an alphavirus, revealed a remarkable fit to the scaffold of TBEV E [20] suggesting the existence of a second class of viral fusion proteins. The dengue virus (DENV) E protein has also been shown to have a class II structure [21]. Recent studies of flavivirus virions and proteins by cryoelectron microscopy and crystal structure analysis have lead to a greatly increased understanding of the function of these class II viral envelope proteins, including the structural rearrangements they undergo during maturation, triggering and fusion [21-28].IntroductionThe flaviviruses, which include DENV, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and TBEV, among others, are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by insect vectors. The most serious manifestations of DENV infection are dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). There are four serotypes of DENV (1–4), which together cause an estimated 50 million human infections per year [29], and each can cause DF, DHF or DSS. Because of the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), or other immune phenomena, protection against one DENV serotype increases the risk of DHF or DSS when the individual is exposed to another serotype [30-32]. Cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing antibodies can mediate entry of DENV into macrophages, dendritic cells and other viral target cells via Fc receptors, increasing virus titers and thus pathology. Multivalent DENV vaccines have shown some promise in humans [32-39] and in nonhuman primate studies [40,41], but face several obstacles. Antiviral drugs, which target each of the four serotypes of DENV without enhancing pathogenesis of any serotype, are urgently needed. The recent introduction of WNV in the United States further highlights the public health challenges posed by flaviviruses. No effective vaccine or antiviral drug therapy is currently available against either DENV or WNV.IntroductionAlthough there are many differences between the structures of class I and class II viral fusion proteins, we hypothesized that they function through a similar membrane fusion mechanism involving rearrangements of domains, and that peptides mimicking portions of class II viral fusion proteins would inhibit virion fusion and entry steps thereby serving as lead compounds for the development of antivirals. We used a physio-chemical algorithm, the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale [1] in combination with known structural data to predict regions of the DENV and WNV E proteins that may play roles in protein-protein rearrangements or bilayer membrane interactions during the entry and fusion process. Several of these peptides specifically inhibit DENV or WNV infection.Identification of Flavivirus inhibitory peptides ::: ResultsThe domains that precede the transmembrane anchors of most class I fusion proteins are not highly hydrophobic, however, they usually contain a cluster of aromatic amino acids and display a tendency to partition into bilayer membranes, as revealed by analyses using the experimentally-determined Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [42]. Fuzeon's corresponding sequence overlaps the aromatic pre-anchor domain of HIV-1 TM. Synthetic peptides corresponding to other domains of class I viral fusion proteins with significant WWIHS scores may also inhibit viral infectivity [43]. Previously, we suggested that peptide drugs analogous to Fuzeon might be developed for HCV and other members of the Flaviviridae [44]. DENV E contains five domains with significant WWIHS scores (Fig. 1, WWIHS sequences in black). These include the fusion peptide domain, a portion of subdomain IIb, the pre-anchor stem region following domain III, and the transmembrane domain. Sequences with high WWIHS scores are similarly located in the X-ray structures of WNV E and alphavirus (SFV and Sindbis virus – SINV) E1, and potentially also in the putative class II fusion proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV), pestiviruses and bunyaviruses [44,45]. Regions with high WWIHS scores are predicted to play a role in protein-protein interactions during structural rearrangements or protein-lipid interactions during bilayer fusion, and we predicted that synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions may have the potential to inhibit flavivirus infectivity.Identification of Flavivirus inhibitory peptides ::: ResultsTo test this hypothesis, an initial set of synthetic peptides representing sequences of DENV E and WNV E with significant WWIHS scores was synthesized and screened for the ability to inhibit plaque formation by these flaviviruses (Table 1). Peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domain were not tested because this region is not exposed during the entry process. Initial assays for inhibitory activity were performed using the highest concentration of each peptide that could be obtained in aqueous solution with a maximum of 1% DMSO (between 29 and 128 μM). Plaque reduction in which the inhibitor is removed after virus adsorption is the most stringent test of an antiviral agent. Prior to initiating these studies, we developed a new immunoplaque assay for DENV and WNV. Approximately 200 focus forming units (FFU) of either WNV or DENV were preincubated with each of the peptides and used to infect monolayers of LLCKM-2 monkey kidney epithelial cells. The number of resulting viral foci was determined from three experiments and normalized to a no-peptide control to calculate the percent inhibition. Our screening of this initial set detected several peptides that were able to inhibit infection by DENV or WNV (Table 1, Fig. 2). Peptides similar in sequence to domains with a significant WWIHS scores, including domain II (IIb) (WN53 and WN83), and stem domain (DN59), were found to have inhibitory activity.Determination of 50% inhibitory concentrations ::: ResultsDose-response curves were determined for the most potent of the peptides WN53 and WN83 against WNV and also for peptide DN59 against DENV (Fig. 3). The WN53 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against WNV of 56.0 +/- 3.0% (mean +/- SD) at 99 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) at roughly 10 μM. The WN83 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against WNV of 70.0 +/- 3.0% at 128 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of roughly 10 μM. The DN59 peptide showed a maximum inhibitory activity against DENV of 100.0 +/- 0.5% at 20 μM. The inhibitory activity decreased with decreasing concentration with an IC50 of at roughly 10 μM. DENV stem peptide 59 (DN59) and WNV peptides 53 and 83 (WN53, WN83) reproducibly inhibited infectivity at low μM concentrations.Specificity of peptide inhibitory activity ::: ResultsThe DN59 peptide matches a pre-anchor domain sequence that is highly conserved among insect-transmitted flaviviruses. DN59 inhibited infection by DENV (>99% inhibition of plaque formation at a concentrations of <25 μM). Cross-inhibition of WNV fusion/infectivity (>99% inhibition at <25 μM) was also reproducibly demonstrated with DN59 (Fig. 6). However, WNV inhibitory peptide WN83 did not inhibit infectivity by DENV.Specificity of peptide inhibitory activity ::: ResultsTo determine if these peptides specifically inhibit infectivity of the viruses for which they were designed, the WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides were tested for inhibitory effects against Sindbis virus (SINV), an alphavirus that encodes a class II fusion protein. None of the peptides showed a statistically significant effect against SINV infectivity (Fig. 4). Peptides with the same amino acid composition as WN83 and DN59, but a scrambled sequence (Scrambled WN83: VATWHLDWSREFPLFLMNS; Scrambled DN59: YFIDTSGAIWGASHLTGVLFDFMGIQGGAVLAK) were synthesized and tested for the ability to inhibit infection by WNV and DENV respectively. Neither scrambled peptide significantly inhibited infection by these viruses (Fig. 5). These results provide evidence that the action of these inhibitory peptides not due to general inactivation of enveloped virions and is sequence specific.Peptide toxicity ::: ResultsIt is possible that inhibitory peptides induce cellular alterations or toxicity that can block flavivirus entry or other steps in the replication cycle. To address this possibility, LLCMK-2 monkey kidney epithelial cell monolayers were exposed to 100 mg/ml concentrations of WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides for 24 hrs, and cell viability was assayed with an MTT assay. No statistical difference was observed between the viability of control cells versus cells exposed to the peptides or DMSO (Fig. 7). This result suggests that these inhibitory peptides are not blocking infectivity via effects on host cell metabolism or viability.Non-synergistic activity of combined peptides ::: ResultsWhen added in combination, peptides that block entry at different steps or that target different domains may produce greater inhibition of DENV-2 infectivity than either peptide alone. Synergistic or antagonistic effects are also possible, if a peptide that alters protein-protein interactions allows greater or lesser access to E domains targeted by another peptide. Since the WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides all inhibited WNV entry, the possibility of antagonistic or synergistic function was examined by testing WN53 and DN59 alone or in combination at three concentrations (5, 10 and 20 μM). At all three concentrations, the peptide combination was more effective than WN53 alone, but less effective than DN59 alone. This indicates that the activity of the WN53 peptide has an antagonistic effect on the function of the DN59 peptide (Fig. 6).DiscussionSynthetic peptides corresponding to sequences in DENV and WNV E proteins were identified that inhibited infectivity of these viral pathogens of major public health importance. The inhibitory effects of these peptides were dose dependent with IC50s in the range of 10 μM. Several of the most potent of these peptides showed no inhibitory activity against SINV, an alphavirus that possesses a class II viral fusion protein with a similar overall structure as flavivirus E. Scrambled peptides with the same amino acid composition as the inhibitory peptides, but with a different primary sequence, failed to inhibit DENV and WNV infection. None of the DENV or WNV inhibitory peptides induced gross cytopathic effects, killing of cultured cells or showed evidence of in vitro cellular toxicity. These results indicate that these inhibitory peptides function through a sequence-specific mechanism and are not merely cytotoxic.DiscussionMembrane fusion by both class I and II viral fusion proteins is initiated by interaction of the fusion peptide with the target cell membrane. In class I viral fusion proteins, a subsequent rearrangement of a trimer of the proteins, each with two α helices, to form a six-helix bundle brings the viral and cell membranes into closer proximity. Inhibitors of viruses with class I fusion proteins, such as Fuzeon™ that mimic a portion of one or the other of the two α helices, interfere with a step proximal to six-helix bundle formation possibly by forming an inactive aggregate with the opposite helix. Recent studies indicate that after insertion of the fusion peptide, class II viral fusion proteins likewise undergo rearrangements. In this case, intraprotein interactions may occur between the stem domain and domains I, II and/or III [21-28,46]. According to this model, the viral and cellular membranes are brought closer by interactions of the stem with other portions of E, resulting in bilayer fusion. DN59, WN53 and WN83 peptides may interfere with the intramolecular interactions between the stem and other portions of class II viral fusion proteins, a possibility suggested previously [23,24,46].DiscussionTwo of the inhibitory peptides (WN53 and WN83) are designed from overlapping regions of the E protein domain I/II junction and are specifically inhibitory against WNV. Recently, other investigators have hypothesized that small molecule inhibitors to this domain I/II junction region might be developed. Modis et al (2003; 2004) predicted that interactions near this region (the k-l loop) that are involved in the rotational changes between these domains might be blocked by small molecule inhibitors. However, our similar peptides designed from the analogous region of the DENV E protein (D57 and D81) failed to inhibit DENV infectivity.DiscussionThe possibility that WN53, WN83 and DN59 interact with some target cell surface component to exert their inhibitory effects cannot be ruled out. However, the majority of flavivirus neutralizing antibodies that appear to be involved in receptor blocking bind to domain III, and soluble domain III itself can block flavivirus entry, apparently through competition for cellular receptors [47-51]. In contrast, the domains that correspond to WN53, WN83 and DN59 peptides, IIb and the pre-anchor stem, appear to be involved in structural rearrangements during fusion, rather than direct interactions with cellular receptors. Interestingly, previous observations indicate that some monoclonal antibodies block virion entry at a post attachment step, indicating that they may interfere with conformational changes necessary for fusion [52]. That possibility that some antibodies can gain access to regions important for conformational changes and block these changes suggests that these inhibitory peptide regions might be candidates for novel vaccine designs that either utilize the inhibitory peptide regions directly as antigens, or target the regions that interact with the inhibitory peptides. Further studies are needed to define the exact mechanism of inhibition of these DENV and WNV peptides, and the specific nature or location of their interactions with viral targets.DiscussionThe DN59 peptide is inhibitory against DENV as well as WNV. The corresponding pre-anchor region is highly conserved between DENV and WNV as well as among other flaviviruses (Table 2) and probably functions in a similar manner during entry of all flaviviruses [53]. Thus, DN59 or similar peptides may act as broad-spectrum flavivirus inhibitors. Other flaviviruses considered potential bioterrorism agents, including JEV, Kyasanur Forest disease virus and TBEV, may also be inhibited by DN59, a DN59 derivative, or by an analogous peptide. Unlike proposed DENV vaccines, which must be multivalent (ie. simultaneously effective against each of the four DENV serotypes because of the phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement), peptide drugs targeting the highly conserved stem conserved motifs in flavivirus E may demonstrate cross-strain efficacy.DiscussionIC50s in the μM range have been considered promising for class I viral fusion protein inhibitor development [54,55]. Thus, the peptides identified here can serve as lead compounds that may be developed as peptide drugs against the four serotypes of DENV, WNV and potentially other flaviviruses. We anticipate that such peptide inhibitors may be as successful as the HIV-1 inhibitory peptide Fuzeon™. Unlike persistant HIV infections, immune responses against DENV and other flaviviruses are capable of clearing the viruses in individuals that survive the initial infection. By reducing the viral load during the initial stages of infection, it may be possible to extend the window of time during which an immune response could arise, and thus enable more individuals to control, eliminate and survive infections by these agents. Evidence for the ability to therapeutically intervene in flavivirus-induced diseases has been demonstrated with the recent observation that administration of neutralizing antibodies against WNV can be curative, even after symptom initiation [56]. Development of resistant mutants will be a concern, but should be a less problematic than in the case of long-term treatment of persistent retroviral infections.DiscussionIt is worth noting that the HIV inhibitor Fuzeon™, was initially identified using a predictive strategy without the availability of structural data [6,7,57]. The fact that we developed these peptides using a predictive algorithm validates our approach as well as the accuracy of the flavivirus E protein structural data. A similar approach may be useful for the large number of other viruses with class II envelope fusion proteins with or without known structures.Design and synthesis of peptides ::: Materials and methodsSequences of DENV and WNV E with positive Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale scores were determined using the program Membrane Protein eXplorer [1]. After consideration of the known secondary structures for several subdomains of E, selected peptides were synthesized by solid-phase conventional N-α-9-flurenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry (Genemed Synthesis, San Francisco, CA). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptide stock solutions were prepared in 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 80% (v/v) H20, and concentrations determined by absorbance of aromatic side chains at 280 nm. Scrambled peptides sequences were obtained by drawing from a hat.Viruses and Cells ::: Materials and methodsDENV strain New Guinea-2 and WNV strain Egypt 101 were obtained from R. Tesh at the World Health Organization Arbovirus Reference Laboratory at the University of Texas at Galveston. DENV and WNV were propagated in the African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line, LLCKM-2, a gift of K. Olsen at Colorado State University. Sindbis virus (SINV) containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein expression cassette was obtained from K. Ryman at Louisiana State University at Shreveport and was propagated in baby hamster kidney cells. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, at 37°C with 5% (v/v) CO2.Viral plaque reduction assays ::: Materials and methodsLLCKM-2 target cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells in each well of a 6-well plate 48 h prior to infection. Approximately 200-focus forming units (FFU) of DENV, WNV, or SINV/EGFP were incubated with or without peptides in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at rt. Virus/peptide or virus/control mixtures were allowed to infect confluent LLCKM-2 monolayers for 1 h at 37°C, after which time the medium was removed and the cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with fresh DMEM/10% (v/v) FBS containing 0.85% (w/v) SeaPlaque Agarose (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME). Cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 day (Sindbis virus), 3 days (WNV) or 6 days (DNV). Sindbis virus infections were quantified by directly counting green fluorescing foci. Cultures infected with DENV were fixed with 10% formalin overnight at 4°C and permeablized with 70% (v/v) ethanol prior to immunostaining and visualization using a human polyclonal anti-flavivirus antibody (a gift of V. Vorndam, CDC, San Juan) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and AEC chromogen substrate (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). WNV plaques were similarly visualized using a mouse anti-WNV antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and an HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).Toxicity assay ::: Materials and methodsPeptide cytotoxicity was measured using the TACS™ MTT cell proliferation assay (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions."
"Neutrophil elastase, an acid-independent serine protease, facilitates reovirus uncoating and infection in U937 promonocyte cells","Mammalian reoviruses are the prototypic members of the Reoviridae family, which also includes the pathogenic rotaviruses, coltiviruses, seadornaviruses and orbiviruses. These viruses share elements of their replication cycle as well as structural features, including a non-enveloped multi-layered capsid that surrounds a segmented dsRNA genome. In humans, mammalian reoviruses are typically associated with mild and self-limiting enteric and respiratory infections. However, studies in neonatal mice reveal that reoviruses can spread to distant tissue sites in immunocompromised hosts (reviewed in[1]). The factors that determine reovirus cellular host range are poorly understood. Because reovirus attaches to cells through interactions with broadly expressed receptors, one or more subsequent steps in the viral life cycle must help to regulate host range and pathogenesis. Our recent studies suggest that one such step is proteolysis of the capsid protein σ3 [2,3].BackgroundIn cell culture, the first step in infection is attachment to cellular receptors through interactions with the viral protein σ1 [4,5]. σ1 interacts with two known receptors: sialic acid and junctional adhesion molecule 1 [6-8]. Following binding, virions are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis [9]. Endocytosis is an essential step in the viral life cycle under standard infection conditions [10]. Within the endosomal and/or lysosomal compartment, proteases convert virions into particles that resemble in vitro-generated intermediate subvirion particles (ISVPs) [10-14]. These uncoating intermediates, typically prepared using chymotrypsin or trypsin, lack σ3 and have a cleaved form of μ1. Studies using ISVPs and ISVPs recoated with recombinant outer capsid proteins reveal that σ3 plays a key role in regulating reovirus cell entry by interacting with, protecting, and controlling the conformational status of the underlying penetration protein μ1 [15-18]. In cells that cannot efficiently mediate σ3 degradation during uncoating, reovirus infection is slow or blocked; these cells can be productively infected by particles that lack σ3 [2]. In vitro, ISVP-like particles can be generated by a variety of proteases in addition to chymotrypsin and trypsin, including proteinase K, thermolysin, endoproteinase lys-C, Cat L, Cat B and Cat S[3,19-21].BackgroundRecent work has provided insight into the cellular determinants of reovirus uncoating. In murine fibroblasts, where reovirus entry has been best studied, the cysteine proteases Cat L, and to a lesser extent Cat B, are required for σ3 removal, whereas the aspartyl protease Cat D is not [14,21-25]. Virion disassembly in murine fibroblasts also requires acidic pH[10,26,27]. Recently, we demonstrated that reovirus uncoating in the macrophage-like cell line P388D is mediated by the acid-independent lysosomal cysteine protease Cat S[3]. This finding revealed that in different cell types, distinct proteases can facilitate reovirus uncoating. Our results suggested a model in which infection in some cells is acid-dependent because the proteases that mediate σ3 removal in those cells require acidic pH for maximal activity. Thus, in fibroblasts or other cells in which the acid-dependent proteases Cat L and Cat B mediate σ3 removal, infection is acid-dependent [21,23,28], whereas in Cat S-expressing cells it is not [3], because Cat S maintains its activity at neutral pH [29]. Insight from the analysis of reovirus cell entry facilitated the recent discovery that activation of the Ebola virus glycoprotein also depends on the activity of the acid-dependent endosomal proteases Cat B and Cat L [30].BackgroundThe role that specific intracellular and extracellular proteases play in regulating reovirus tropism, spread, and disease in animals is largely unknown, except in the murine intestinal tract where pancreatic serine proteases have been shown to mediate σ3 removal [31,32]. Reovirus also naturally infects hosts via the respiratory tract [33-35]. One protease with well-described effects in the respiratory tract is elastase 2 (GenBank NM_001972), an inflammatory serine protease of the chymotrypsin family, which is predominantly expressed by neutrophils [36]. NE plays a prominent role in wound repair [37-39] and in controlling microbial infections [38-40]. NE expression can also promote pathogenesis; it has been implicated in smoke-induced emphysema [41], respiratory syncytial viral bronchiolitis [42] and in the respiratory syndrome ARDS [4]. The fact that reovirus replication in the rodent lung causes an influx of neutrophils [35,43] and that reovirus infection can recapitulate ARDS [44], led us to ask whether NE could mediate productive reovirus uncoating. We investigated reovirus infection in the monocyte-like cell line U937, because it is known to express NE [45]. Experiments described in this report demonstrate that reovirus infection in U937 cells does not require cysteine protease activity and is not blocked in the presence of agents that raise vesicular pH. Studies using protease inhibitors suggest that, in the absence of cysteine protease activity, NE is largely responsible for productive infection of U937 cells. NE can directly mediate σ3 removal from reovirus virions; the resultant particles are infectious and do not require additional intracellular proteolysis. Our data raise the possibility that NE is involved in reovirus replication in the respiratory tract.Reovirus infection of U937 cells does not require cysteine protease activity ::: ResultsThe promonocytic cell line U937 expresses large amounts of elastase [45] and provided a suitable system to analyze the role of this protease in reovirus infection. To determine if NE can facilitate reovirus infection of U973 cells, we first established conditions under which lysosomal cysteine protease activity was inhibited. Cells were treated with 300 μM E64, a broad-spectrum cysteine protease inhibitor [46], and protease activity was assessed using the Cat L and Cat B-specific fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. We analyzed enzyme activity at two time points: first after 3 h of treatment, because we typically pre-treat cells with inhibitors for 3 h prior to infection, and second at 3 d, the time point at which viral yield would be quantified. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with 300 μM E64 completely abolished cysteine protease activity in U937 cells. Consistent with our previous findings [3], E64 also completely blocked cysteine protease activity in L929 cells. Raw values are provided, to illustrate the relative difference in Cat L/B enzyme activity levels between U937 cells and L929 fibroblasts. In the absence of inhibitor, Cat L and B activity was significantly lower in U937 cells than in L929 cells. This may be a consequence of high expression in U937 cells of cystatin F, an intracellular cysteine protease inhibitor with specificity for Cat L and papain [47].Reovirus infection of U937 cells does not require cysteine protease activity ::: ResultsNext, we compared reovirus replication in E64-treated U937 and L929 cells. Cells were pre-treated for 3 h and infected with Lang virions or ISVPs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. In the absence of E64, both L929 and U937 cells supported reovirus replication, consistent with the fact that these cells express Cat L. As expected, E64 blocked virion infection of L929 cells; however, viral yields in E64-treated U937 cells were only slightly reduced relative to untreated cells. ISVPs, which lack capsid protein σ3, replicated efficiently in treated cells, indicating that 300 μM E64 was not toxic to either cell type. These results demonstrate that productive infection of U937 cells by Lang virions does not require the activity of E64-sensitive, papain-like cysteine proteases.Infection of U937 cells is acid-independent ::: ResultsAcidic pH is required for productive reovirus infection of murine L929 fibroblasts [10,27], in which the acid-dependent proteases Cat L and Cat B mediate uncoating [21,23]. Serine proteases, including NE, and metalloproteases function over a broader pH range. Therefore, to gain insight into the nature of the protease(s) that can promote reovirus uncoating in U937 cells, we investigated the requirements for acidic pH. L929 and U937 cells were left untreated or pre-treated with E64 in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (Baf) or NH4Cl. These latter agents raise vesicular pH by blocking the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump or by acting as a weak base, respectively [48-50]. After pre-treatment, cells were infected with Lang virions at an MOI of 3 and viral yields were determined at 3 days post infection (d p.i.). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2. Treatment with either Baf or NH4Cl did not inhibit viral replication in U937 cells; yields reached 2.9 and 2.7 logs, respectively. Furthermore, these agents had little effect on viral replication in U937 cells even when the cells were also treated with E64 to inhibit cysteine protease activity. In contrast, Baf or NH4Cl alone completely blocked reovirus replication in L929 cells, consistent with the requirement for Cat L/B-mediated σ3 removal in these cells. Given that reovirus uncoating is an essential step in the viral life cycle [10], these findings revealed that a non-cysteine protease that functions at neutral pH can facilitate this step in U937 cells.Analysis of reovirus replication in U937 cells differentiated by PMA ::: ResultsTreatment of the promonocytic U937 cells with phorbol ester derivatives results in their differentiation into macrophage-like cells [51,52]. This differentiation is characterized by several major phenotypic changes, including increases in expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptors, upregulation of collagenase activity and a significant decrease in the expression of NE and Cat G [51,52]. We predicted, therefore, that PMA treatment might decrease the capacity of reovirus virions to replicate in U937 cells when cysteine proteases were inhibited. To confirm that there was a significant decrease in NE expression in U937 cells differentiated with PMA, U937 cells were treated with 150 nM PMA for 72 h and expression of NE was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, NE was expressed in untreated U937 cells, but its expression was dramatically reduced following PMA-induced differentiation.Analysis of reovirus replication in U937 cells differentiated by PMA ::: ResultsTo examine the effect of U937 cell differentiation on reovirus infection, PMA-treated and untreated U937 cells were left untreated or were treated with E64 for 3 h and infected with Lang virions or ISVPs at an MOI of 3. Yields were measured at 3 d p.i. and the results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 3B. In the absence of E64, PMA-treated U937 cells were permissive to infection by virions. PMA treatment only decreased yields by ~0.5 log relative to untreated cells. In contrast, when PMA-differentiated U937 cells were treated with E64 to inhibit cysteine protease activity, they no longer supported productive infection by Lang virions. Because these results could be explained if E64 was toxic to PMA-treated U937 cells, we examined the replication of ISVPs. In the presence of E64, ISVPs replicated to high yields in both undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells. Since PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells caused a substantial decrease in NE expression, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that NE or another similarly regulated neutral protease facilitates productive reovirus infection in promonocytic (pre-differentiated) U937 cells.NE can facilitate reovirus infection in U937 cells ::: ResultsWe directly examined the capacity of NE to facilitate reovirus infection by using the irreversible elastase inhibitor, N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone [53]. This inhibitor is highly specific for NE and does not inhibit the activity of the related serine protease, Cat G [53]. First, we established the efficacy and specificity of inhibitor treatment under our experimental conditions. U937 cells were treated with the NE inhibitor, E64, Baf or NH4Cl for either 3 h or 2 d and the activity of NE in cell lysates was examined using a colorimetric substrate. As shown in Table 1, the NE inhibitor was active at both time points. In cells treated with the specific inhibitor, NE activity was less than 9% of that in untreated U937 cells. In contrast, in U937 cells treated with E64, Baf or NH4Cl, NE activity was only modestly reduced, remaining above 80% even after 2 d. These results are consistent with the capacity of NE to function at neutral pH. To verify the specificity of the NE inhibitor, we also examined its effect on Cat L/B activity using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA. As expected, Cat L/B activity was completely inhibited by E64 but largely unaffected by the NE inhibitor.NE can facilitate reovirus infection in U937 cells ::: ResultsTo examine the effect of the NE inhibitor on reovirus replication in U937 cells, we pre-treated them for 3 h with E64 in the presence or absence of the NE inhibitor, infected them with Lang virions or ISVPs at an MOI of 3, and quantified viral yields at 2 d p.i. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4. Consistent with the results shown in Fig 1, virion replication was not blocked in E64-treated U937 cells. However, in the presence of both E64 and the NE inhibitor, yields were significantly reduced. ISVPs replicated to high yields in treated cells, indicating that the combination of inhibitors was not toxic to U937 cells. These results demonstrate that NE plays a critical role in reovirus infection of U937 cells when cysteine proteases are inhibited.NE-generated subviral particles are infectious and do not require additional proteolytic processing ::: ResultsNE, like many cellular proteases, is expressed as a proenzyme that becomes activated only after its pro-region is removed [54]. We envisioned two models by which NE could facilitate reovirus infection of U937 cells. In the first, NE could directly mediate σ3 degradation, leading to the generation of an ISVP-like particle. In the second, NE could act indirectly by activating another protease. To try to distinguish between these models, we examined the capacity of purified NE to directly mediate σ3 removal from Lang virions in vitro. Purified Lang virions were treated with NE for 1 and 4 h and the treated virus particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5A, NE efficiently removed σ3 from Lang virions; after 1 h very little intact σ3 remained on viral particles. After 4 h of NE treatment, σ3 was completely removed and the underlying μ1C was cleaved to the δ and φ fragments (φ was not retained on the gel). When we assayed the infectivity of the resultant particles by plaque assay we found that NE treatment did not negatively affect the titer of Lang particles (data not shown).NE-generated subviral particles are infectious and do not require additional proteolytic processing ::: ResultsTo determine if NE-generated SVPs required further proteolytic processing of σ3, L929 cells were pre-treated with E64 to block cysteine protease activity and infected at an MOI of 3 with Lang virions, ISVPs or NE-generated subviral particles (NE-SVPs). Viral yields were determined at 1 d p.i. As expected, E64 blocked infection of L929 cells by virions. In contrast, both ISVPs and NE-SVPs replicated efficiently in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Because virion disassembly in L929 cells requires acidic pH [10], we also examined the capacity of NE-SVPs to infect L929 cells treated with Baf, NH4Cl or monensin, three agents that raise vesicular pH by distinct mechanisms. Cells were treated with these agents and then infected with virions, ISVPs or NE-SVPs at an MOI of 10. At 18 hours post infection (h p.i.), cell lysates were harvested and expression of the reovirus non-structural protein μNS was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C). As expected, when treated cells were infected with virions, viral protein expression was blocked. In contrast, μNS expression was evident even in the presence of agents that raise pH when infections were initiated with ISVPs or NE-SVPs (Fig. 5C). Together, these results demonstrate that NE can directly mediate σ3 removal from virions to generate infectious particles that do not require further proteolytic processing by acid-dependent cysteine proteases in L929 cells.NE, an acid-independent serine protease, can promote productive reovirus infection in U937 promonocytes ::: DiscussionSerine proteases are involved in reovirus infection in the mammalian intestinal tract [31] and in this report we provide evidence that they can mediate uncoating and promote infection in U937 cells. This expands the range of proteases that promote reovirus infection in cell culture to include NE as well as the cysteine proteases Cat L, Cat B, and Cat S. Several lines of evidence now support the notion that protease expression is a cell-specific host factor that can impact reovirus infection. For example, some reovirus strains are inefficiently uncoated by Cat S and thus do not replicate to high yield in P388D macrophages [3]. In this report we demonstrate that PMA-induced differentiation influences the type of protease that mediates reovirus uncoating in U937 cells. In these cells, PMA treatment is reported to increase Cat L expression [55] and decrease expression of the serine proteases NE and Cat G [56,57]. Accordingly, when we used PMA to induce U937 cell cultures to differentiate, reovirus infection became sensitive to the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. We suspect that Cat L is largely responsible for uncoating in these PMA-differentiated cells, but the acid-independent protease Cat S may also play a role. We are currently addressing this question by analyzing infection in PMA-differentiated cells treated with either Baf or NH4Cl.Does the serine protease Cat G also play a role in reovirus infection of U937 cells? ::: DiscussionOur data do not completely resolve this question. Cat G is expressed by U937 cells and, like NE, it is down-regulated by PMA treatment. Furthermore, we found that in vitro treatment of reovirus virions with purified Cat G generates SVPs that behave like NE-SVPs in that they are infectious in the absence of further proteolytic processing (data not shown). Results of our experiment with the NE-specific inhibitor suggest that NE is largely responsible for the E64-resistant infection in U937 cells. While this inhibitor is reported not to inhibit Cat G [53], we have not independently confirmed this. Another approach to assess the role of Cat G in reovirus infection of U937 cells would be to examine the effect of Cat G-specific inhibitors on infection. We tried one such inhibitor, Cathepsin G Inhibitor I (Calbiochem)[58], but found that it was cytotoxic to U937 cell cultures. Given that both NE and Cat G can generate infectious reovirus SVPs, more work needs to be done in order to understand the role that these two proteases play in infection in these cells.The acid-dependence of reovirus infection is a reflection of the requirements for protease activation ::: DiscussionPreviously, we reported that virion uncoating mediated by Cat S does not require acidic pH [3]. These results were consistent with the acid-independence of Cat S activity [37]. Together, the results in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 reveal that, like Cat S, NE-mediates infection in an acid-independent manner. This finding thus provides further support for a model in which the requirement for acidic pH during reovirus infection of some cell types reflects the requirement for acid-dependent protease activity in those cells rather than some other requisite acid-dependent aspect of cell entry. The small effect of Baf and NH4Cl on E64-resistant reovirus growth (Fig. 2) may reflect the participation of one or more acid-dependent proteases (such as Cat D) in the activation of NE.Does NE mediate uncoating intracellularly or extracellularly in U937 cell cultures? ::: DiscussionElastase is stored in azurophilic granules that are the major source of acid-dependent hydrolases in neutrophils [59]. Although these granules do not contain LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 [60] they contain the lysosomal markers LAMP-3 [61] and CD68 [62] and are accessible to endocytosed fluid-phase markers under conditions of cellular stimulation [63]. NE can be released from neutrophils during degranulation [64] and its cell surface expression can be induced upon PMA treatment [65]. However, studies in U937 cells have shown that NE is predominantly retained intracellularly and that little if any activity is present in the extracellular medium [45]. Consistent with this, we have been unable to generate ISVP-like particles by treatment of virions with U937 culture supernatants (data not shown). This observation, together with our finding that PMA treatment decreases the capacity of E64-treated U937 cells to support reovirus infection, leads us to favor a model in which NE-mediated virion uncoating in U937 cell cultures occurs intracellularly.Implications for infection in the host ::: DiscussionIn vivo, a number of viruses, including dengue and respiratory syncytial virus, induce the release of IL-8, a cytokine that serves as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and promotes their degranulation [66,67]. Reovirus replication in the rat lung results in neutrophilic invasion [35,43] and studies in cell culture indicate that reovirus infection can induce IL-8 expression [68]. Thus, the capacity of reovirus to induce IL-8 secretion in vivo might facilitate the release of neutrophilic lysosomal hydrolases, including NE, into the extracellular milieu. In this report, we have shown that mammalian reovirus can utilize this acid-independent serine protease for uncoating. Our data suggest that, in vivo, one consequence of reovirus-induced IL-8 expression would be the generation of infectious NE-SVPs. Like ISVPs, these particles would be predicted to have an expanded cellular host range because they can infect cells that restrict intracellular uncoating [2]. Thus, inflammation might be predicted to exacerbate reovirus infection by promoting viral spread. Future studies using mice with deletions in the NE gene will be required to elucidate the role this protease plays during reovirus infection in the respiratory tract and other tissues. Finally, given the recent finding that endosomal proteolysis of the Ebola virus glycoprotein is necessary for infection [30], our results raise the interesting possibility that NE or other neutrophil proteases may play a role in cell entry of other viruses.Cells and viruses ::: MethodsMurine L929 cells were maintained as suspension cultures as described previously [Kedl, 1995 #94]. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented to contain 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco-BRL), 50-units/ml penicillin (GIBCO-BRL), 50 μg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO-BRL) and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO-BRL). Where indicated, U937 cells were differentiated by treatment with 150 nM of PMA (Sigma) for 48 h prior to infection.Cells and viruses ::: MethodsThird-passage lysate stocks of reovirus were prepared in L929 cell cultures. Purified virions were prepared by CsCl density gradient centrifugation of extracts from cells infected with third-passage lysate stocks [Furlong, 1988 #81]. ISVPs were prepared by treating purified virions with chymotrypsin as described elsewhere [Nibert, 1992 #95].Measurement of cysteine protease activity ::: MethodsCysteine protease activity was measured as described previously [23] with some minor modifications. Briefly, P388D U937 and L929 cells (2 × 106 each) were incubated in the presence or absence of 300 μM E-64, 5 nM LHVS, or 5 μM CA074 for the times indicated. After incubation, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation at 179 × g for 10 min at 4°C and washed once in PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM sodium acetate [pH 5.5], 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100), incubated on ice for 30 min and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 89 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For each sample, 20 μl of clarified cell lysate was added to 80 μl of reaction buffer (100 mM sodium acetate [pH 5.5], 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM dithiothreitol) in a well of a black 96-well plate (Corning). To measure Cat B activity, 100 μM Z-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg MCA) (Calbiochem) was included in the reaction buffer. To measure Cat L and Cat B activity, 100 μM Z-Phe-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-MCA) (Calbiochem) was added to the reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle tapping every 10 min. Fluorescence was measured using an FL600 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) with an excitation of 390 nm and emission at 460 nm.Measurement of serine protease activity ::: MethodsNE activity was determined by incubating 3 × 106 U937 cells in the presence or absence of 200 μM NE inhibitor (N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone) (Sigma) for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were collected by centrifugation at 179 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice in PBS and lysed in TLB (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2.5 mM MgCλ2, 100 NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/μl of leupeptin [Sigma], 1 mM PMSF) for 30 m on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 89 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For each sample, 20 μl of cell lysate was added to 80 μl of virion dialysis buffer (VDB) (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5]) containing 500 μM of NE substrate (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA) (Calbiochem) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle tapping every 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an EL340 BioTek microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments).Analysis of viral growth ::: MethodsCells were infected (in triplicate) at the indicated MOI and adsorption was allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice at 4°C. After adsorption, cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media. Virus and cells were then added to dram vials (2 × 105 cells/vial) containing 1 ml of chilled medium. Prior to infection, some cells were pre-treated for 3 h with 300 μM E64 and/or 25 nM Baf (Sigma), 20 mM NH4Cl (Sigma) and 200 μM NE inhibitor. Inhibitors were included in the medium throughout the time course for treated samples. Time zero samples were immediately frozen at -20°C and remaining samples were incubated at 37°C until the desired time point was reached. Samples were frozen and thawed three times and titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells as described elsewhere [69]. Viral yields were calculated according to the following formula: log10(PFU/ml)t = x hr - log10 (PFU/ml)t = 0 +/- standard deviation (SD).In vitro analysis of NE-mediated uncoating ::: MethodsNE digestions were performed as follows. Purified virions (7.5 × 1010) were incubated with 25 μg/ml of purified NE (Calbiochem) in 20 μL VDB at 37°C for the times indicated. Mock-treated samples were incubated in VDB for the longest time point. 1 mM PMSF and 200 μM of NE inhibitor were added to the samples to terminate the reactions. Protein sample buffer (0.125 M Tris [pH 8.0], 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% sucrose, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each reaction mixture and samples were resolved on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. The protein gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Immunoblot analysis of NE expression ::: MethodsTo analyze NE expression, cell lysates were generated from U937 cells, either treated or untreated for 48 h with 150 nM PMA as described for the analysis of viral protein expression. Lysate from the equivalent of 1 × 106 cells was run on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked overnight in TBST containing 10% nonfat dry milk. NE expression was analyzed using a polyclonal antibody against NE (1:400 in TBST) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:5000 in TBST). Bound antibody was detected by treating the nitrocellulose filters with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham) and exposing them to Full Speed Blue X-ray film (Henry Schein, Melville, NY).Analysis of viral protein expression in infected cells ::: MethodsCells were plated at 106/well in a 6-well plate 18–24 h prior to infection. Virus was allowed to adsorb to cells for 1.5 h at 4°C. At this temperature, virus binds to cells but is not internalized [70]. After adsorption, the cultures were incubated at 37°C in fresh medium. Prior to some infections, cells were pre-treated for 3 h with 300 μM E64, 100 nM Baf, 25 μM monensin (Sigma), or 20 mM NH4Cl. In those instances inhibitors were also included in the post-adsorption culture medium. At the indicated times p.i., cells were collected by centrifugation at 179 × g, washed twice in chilled PBS and lysed in TLB. After centrifugation at 179 × g to remove cellular debris, samples were resuspended in sample buffer. Protein samples (representing 1 × 105 cells) were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 100 V in 25 mM Tris-192 mM glycine-20% methanol. Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) were blocked overnight at 4°C in TBST (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, rinsed with TBST, and incubated with a rabbit anti-μNS polyclonal antiserum [71] (1:12500 in TBST) for 1 h. Membranes were subsequently washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunogloblin G (IgG) (1:7500 in TBST) (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). Bound antibody was detected by treating the nitrocellulose filters with enhanced chemilumescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham) and exposing the filters to Full Speed Blue X-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.).Generation of NE subviral particles for infection ::: MethodsPurified virions (1.4 × 1011) were incubated with 25 μg/ml of purified neutrophil elastase (Calbiochem) in 40 μL of VDB at 37°C for 3 h. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 mM PMSF and 200 μM NE inhibitor to the reaction mixture. 5.0 × 1010 particles were run on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm the removal of σ3. Viral infectivity was determined by plaque assay on L929 cell monlayers.Analysis of virus titer after NE treatment of virions ::: MethodsPurified Lang virions (1.4 × 1011) were treated with 25 μg/ml of NE in 40 μL of VDB at 37°C for the times indicated. Reactions were terminated as described above. To verify σ3 removal, the proteins from 5.0 × 1010 particles were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Viral infectivity for each time point was determined by plaque assay on L929 cell monolayers.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsJ.W.G. performed all experiments and was responsible for the experimental design and data analysis.

A new paradigm in respiratory hygiene: increasing the cohesivity of airway secretions to improve cough interaction and reduce aerosol dispersion,"Infectious respiratory diseases are a prime cause of morbidity, mortality and health system utilization worldwide, but have a greater impact on the developing and least developed countries. Respiratory infections including tuberculosis (TB) caused 5.5 million deaths during 2001. Mortality rates are only part of the burden, since individuals with infections are often unable to work, becoming trapped in a vicious cycle of ill health and poverty [1].BackgroundViruses and bacteria cause most of the infectious respiratory diseases. These pathogens can travel from country to country in different continents in a matter of hours, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of SARS [1,2]. Children, the elderly, and those with defective immune systems or with underlying chronic diseases are at highest risk of being affected by airborne infectious diseases.BackgroundHealth care providers are at risk of acquiring transmissible respiratory diseases while providing care or working in contaminated environments. The SARS outbreak has validated these concerns in advance of the feared flu pandemic. SARS has also confirmed that infectious diseases can cause great disruptions in all sectors – economic, educational, recreational, familial – and can bring health care systems to near collapse. Several strategies and devices have been designed to protect various sectors of society whether at peacetime or during conflicts.BackgroundDifferent individual protective barriers, such as surgical masks, face shields and respiratory protection equipment have been used; however, they yield a much lower protection than the theory might indicate [3]. The individual protective equipment must be chosen according to the agent and to the activities performed by the user, and consider the compliance of the user and the adequacy of the fit and the effectiveness of the seal. Wearing well-fitted protective equipment for long periods of time could impair the satisfactory performance of duties of health care providers. Hence adequate and cost-effective strategies are still needed.BackgroundVaccination is the main strategy to control outbreaks of a number of infectious diseases including the flu pandemic, but the WHO states that other advance control measures will definitively be required since vaccines take time to become available [4].BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a curable, transmissible malady known for at least 3,400 years. The WHO and other organizations estimate that two billion people around the world are infected with M. tuberculosis. Eight million new active cases of TB are reported annually, mostly in age-productive adults. Two million people died of TB in 2002, more than in any previous year in history, becoming the leading killer of adults worldwide [5].BackgroundM. tuberculosis can develop resistance to multiple, first-line anti-TB drugs (MDR-TB). This type of resistance spirals the costs beyond 100 times per patient, bringing more suffering to countries afflicted with TB [6]. Involuntary quarantine in TB patients with non-adherent attitudes is enforced as a last resource measure [7] to control its spread.BackgroundIn cystic fibrosis, recurrent and persistent respiratory infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Jones et al. [8] concluded that cross-infection outbreaks of P. aeruginosa were caused by respiratory aerosol dissemination.BackgroundInfectious respiratory diseases, whether viral or bacterial, are transmitted to non-infected subjects when an infected patient expels pathogenic microorganisms to the surrounding environment when coughing, sneezing or even possibly when talking. Duguid [9] determined that the number of particles of 100 μm or less in diameter contained in the aerosol formed during speaking were between 0 – 200 particles, while during coughing there were 0 – 3,500 particles and during sneezing there were 4,500 – 1, 000,000 particles. Fennelly [10], studying the size of the infectious particles generated during cough, estimated that close to 50% of them were fine particles, less than 2 μm range, small enough to reach the alveoli within the lungs.BackgroundFor the transmission of any respiratory pathogen at least three components are required: a) the transmissor or source (infected person), b) the surrounding environment, and c) the recipient (non-infected person). It is important to additionally consider the concentration of infectious particles determined by the volume of the space and its ventilation, the length of time of exposure, as well as the status of defense mechanisms of the exposed individual.BackgroundThis prompted a research question: Is it possible to control the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases by modulating the physical characteristics of viscoelasticity, cohesivity and surface tension of the respiratory secretions to minimize the aerosolization that facilitates transmission of airborne diseases – a transmission-blocking approach? We found in our literature search no report in regards to this type of approach or drugs. Before testing the mucomodulators we established a fundamental criterion: Can we modulate the physical characteristics of the respiratory secretions to reduce aerosolization without affecting normal clearance function, or even better by improving it?BackgroundHence, we focused our attention on the mucus layer of the airways. The mucin macromolecule (Figure 1) consists of a protein core surrounded by short oligosaccharide side-chains, held together by different links: O-glycosidic bonds, disulphide bridges, hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds, which are the targets of the existing mucolytic agents [11].BackgroundThe mucus along with serous fluid forms the airway surface fluid (ASF) that provides a protective milieu for the airways. The composition and physical characteristics of ASF allow for normal ciliary activity and airway protection [12,13]. When disruption of normal secretory or mucociliary clearance processes occurs, respiratory secretions can accumulate and impair pulmonary function, reduce lung defenses and increase the risk for infection and possibly neoplasia [14].BackgroundNinety-five per cent (95%) of mucus is water and the remaining 5% is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, salts, etc. Therefore, when the airway mucus layer interacts with high-speed airflow during coughing, there is formation of droplets of different sizes that are expelled to the surrounding environment as an aerosol. The concentration of droplets and their size distribution may each play an important role in the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases.BackgroundMicron-sized droplets dry quickly, remain airborne for long periods and reach the lower respiratory system when inhaled. These breathable particles might indirectly infect many persons, e.g. via a common ventilation system. In contrast, large droplets are propelled onto the nearest surface – oral, respiratory, or ocular mucosa of a nearby person – or settle readily to the floor. Regarding transmission, larger particles may have an immediate effect – direct but limited – while micron-size particles may have more indirect effects with longer-lasting and widespread consequences.BackgroundFor this study, our basic goal was to assess a new generation of mucomodulators in a novel approach that has the potential to modulate the physical characteristics of the mucin glycoprotein gel network. This intervention would increases the mucin crosslinking binding sites to reduce the aerosolizability on mucus simulants (surrogate of transmissibility), and/or forming poorly soluble mucin complexes. We aimed to achieve the former while interfering only minimally with normal mucus clearance and hopefully even improving clearability in patients with airway mucus retention.BackgroundOur hypothesis is that transmission of airborne diseases can be controlled by implementing a co-adjuvant pharmacological intervention, additional to the indicated standard treatment, aimed at modulating the physical and biochemical characteristics of the respiratory secretions of both the transmissor who carries the infection to minimize expectorated material that carries the pathogens, and in the non-infected potential recipient.Mucus simulants (MS) ::: MethodsThe MS ranged from a non-viscous, non-elastic substance (water) to MS of varying degrees of viscosity and elasticity. To prepare viscoelastic mucus simulants, we followed the procedure described by King et al. [15]. Mucus simulants were formulated and developed to be transported within the normal range of velocity in a ciliated epithelium and cleared from a simulated cough machine (SCM) set to have a close to normal human cough. Mucus simulants viscous-only were prepared dissolving different concentrations (0.5 %, 0.75 % and 1 %) of locust bean gum (LBG) in warm Ringer solution, and then adding activated charcoal, bromophenol blue 1% or Coomassie blue to dye the solution for better visualization.Frog palate preparation ::: MethodsFrom a bullfrog, Rana catesbiana, the upper portion of the head was removed following the procedures described in previous work [16,17], by cutting with scissors through from the junction of the posterior pharynx and esophagus out to the skin of the back. This procedure was carried out after lowering the body temperature of the frog for 30 – 60 minutes inside a refrigerator to abolish pain sensations. The palate was examined for macroscopic lesions, such as ulcers, petechia or redness as evidence of inflammation; only palates free of inflammatory indicators were used. Any blood remaining in the epithelial surface was carefully washed away, then the excised head was placed palate side facing upwards on a piece of gauze saturated with frog Ringer solution (FRS) in a Petri dish.Frog palate preparation ::: MethodsThe palate was placed inside the frog chamber, a wooden box with a glass top and fitted glass front, and manipulated through glove openings. The humidity inside the box was maintained near 100% using a Pari jet nebulizer, and the temperature was kept between 22° and 24°C by a rheostat-controlled, externally mounted light source. Before carrying out any measurement, the palate was allowed to stabilize inside the box for 15 minutes before testing.Frog palate preparation ::: MethodsThe FRS was prepared by mixing standard Ringer injection with sterile water (2:1). The composition of standard frog Ringer (in mmol/L) is 90 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, and 15 NaHCO3 (220 mosm/L). The Health Sciences Animal Policy and Welfare Committee, University of Alberta approved the experimental procedures involving animalsSimulated mucus transport velocity (MTV) determination ::: MethodsThe palate was placed under a dissecting stereomicroscope provided with a reticulated eyepiece. Mucociliary clearance was determined by observing the movement of particles of charcoal powder gently deposited on a sample of simulated mucus on the palate surface; its clearance was visually monitored and MTV determined. The displacement of 3 – 5 μL of endogenous frog mucus sample was calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the transit time across the 0.3-inch (7.62 mm) segment marked between 0.1 and 0.4 inches in the graduated eyepiece. To obtain control and simulated mucus transport velocities, at least five measurements of the time required for the mucus sample to travel the defined distance were made.Tissue and mucus sample collection ::: MethodsSamples of tissue and mucus from frog palates exposed to topical application of mucomodulators, were immersed in glutaraldehyde 2.5%, and stored at 4°C for later scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies. The epithelial tissue was carefully dissected and separated from the palate musculature.Aerosol formation assay ::: MethodsTo assess the aerosol pattern formed after coughing, we used a range of fluids of varied physical characteristics from non-viscous, non-elastic substances such as water, to highly viscoelastic substances such as simulated mucus samples of varying degrees of viscosity and elasticity. To better visualize the dispersion pattern of the fluids exposed to high-speed airflow in the SCM, we stained all the fluids.Spinnability ::: MethodsThe capacity of a fluid to form threads when stretched, an expression of elasticity, was assessed in the Filancemeter (SEFAM, France) prior to exposure to airflow in the SCM. A volume of approximately 50 μL of the sample to be studied is introduced in a reservoir that is then sucked in. A low current is applied to the sample from a voltage supply, and when the sample is stretched vertically, the apparatus electronically measures the maximum length of the thread at the moment of the rupture of the thread. For every mucus sample, four measurements of the length of the thread at the moment of rupture were made, and used to compute the spinnability in mm.Cough aerosolization ::: MethodsThe simulated cough machine was used to test the main hypothesis that the modulated mucus will result in less aerosolized (airborne) material following cough. Since cough is the most critical process of mucus aerosolization, the successful reduction of droplet production during cough will likely predict reduced amounts emitted during sneezing and speaking. All fluids were placed at different distances from the ""mouth"" opening of the simulated airway to examine if distance from the target may be a factor in determining the dispersion pattern. Later, we decided on a fixed distance to place the sample of MS to be exposed to high-speed airflow interaction. The target was a ""bullseye-type"" (circles within circles). We also placed paper sheets to lateral sides, on top, and below the target sheet to account for any fluid that is dispersed in areas other than on the target sheet.Cough clearability assay ::: MethodsThe modified simulated cough machine system comprises the following elements: A 10-L tank with compressed air, which serves as a pressure reservoir that generates airflow, simulating the lungs during a cough maneuver. The pressure generated prior to a normal adult cough is approximately 8 psi, and we used this pressure value to simulate the airflow pattern of a human cough for each trial.Cough clearability assay ::: MethodsThis modified machine has a model ""airway or trachea"" consisting of a 28 cm long rigid acrylic tube with a circular 2.5 cm cross-section. It has an 8 cm detachable muzzle end-piece (59.805 g) that enabled us to weigh the sample of MS loaded before and immediately after each cough maneuver and report the mass of MS expelled or retained. A solenoid valve located between the pressure reservoir and the model trachea control the gas released from the tank.Cough clearability assay ::: MethodsAn aliquot of sputum is layered on the bottom of the model trachea and driven forward by the pressurized gas. The distance traveled by sputum samples under standardized cough-simulating airflow is used as a measure of cough clearability. The target was placed at a working distance of 40 cm from the mouth of the SCM. The simulated cough maneuver is repeated four times with each sputum sample.Cough clearability assay ::: MethodsAirway clearance (""expectoration"" of mucus simulant from the ""airways""): Measurements of the weight of the MS sample loaded before and after each cough maneuver were carried out in a Mettler AE 163 microbalance.Scanning electron microscopy ::: MethodsSamples of mucus and tissue were placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution immediately after collection and stored at 4°C until processing. The samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in Millonig's buffer at room temperature for one hour. They were then washed in a series of ethanol (50 – 100%), ten minutes at each step, followed by two additional periods of absolute ethanol (10 minutes each). The samples were further dehydrated by critical point drying at 31°C for 5 – 10 minutes, then mounted on a specimen holder for SEM and dried overnight in vacuum desiccators. In the final stage of preparation for viewing, the samples were sputter coated with gold (Edwards, model S150B Sputter Coater). Samples were viewed using SEM (Hitachi S-2500). Images were scanned directly to a computer and stored as image files for subsequent viewing and analysis.Mucomodulators ::: MethodsWe explored four different approaches that have the potential to accomplish our primary goals of reducing aerosolization of mucus while promoting airway clearance. However, for the purpose of this study, we report only two of them here. Sodium tetraborate, named also as XL""B"" or mucomodulator B, and calcium chloride, named also as XL ""C"" or mucomodulator C. The other approaches, high molecular weight dextran, named also XL ""D"" or mucomodulator D, and polyarginine, named also XL ""A"" or mucomodulator A will be reported independently in other publications [18].Sodium tetraborate (XL ""B"") ::: MethodsSodium tetraborate causes reversible crosslink formation between galactose units [19], which are the major neutral sugar components of mucin. Addition of borate to galactose polymers preferentially raises elasticity relative to viscosity. We added three different volumes of 0.1 M borate (1.5 μL, 15 μL and 150 μL) to the MS to produce three levels of crosslinking, and exposed each of the gels to four cough maneuver measurements per trial.Calcium chloride (XL ""C"") ::: MethodsCalcium chloride increases the concentration of divalent cations in the mucus. Conceptually, this is the opposite of what occurs in nature during mucin exocytosis, where intracellular mucin granules, which were held tightly through ion crosslinks, give way to much looser interactions as ion exchange occurs during fusion with the apical membrane [20]. A volume of 4 μL of frog Ringer and 4 μL of three different concentrations of calcium chloride (0.001 M, 0.01 M and 0.1 M) were directly applied through a micropipette to a fresh frog palate in order to assess their effect on mucus transport velocity and on the morphology of the tissue and mucus layer.Statistical analysis ::: MethodsData are expressed as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. A paired Student-T test was used for simple comparison. Neuman-Keuls analysis was applied for repeated measurements. The level of significance was set at 5 %.Staining the samples ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsBromophenol Blue made the MS solutions very watery and it reduced viscosity of the MS; hence we rejected the use of this dye from further testing. Activated charcoal did not alter the viscoelastic properties of the MS sample and helped to better visualize the gel sample on the frog palate; however charcoal adds mass to the sample that eventually might alter the dispersion pattern. Coomassie Blue did not alter the viscoelastic properties of MS; hence it was used to dye the samples.Transportability ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsSamples of MS of non-viscous, non-elastic properties (frog Ringer solution) of approximately 0.2 – 0.5 mL at room temperature were placed on the frog palate; these dispersed on the surface and were not transported by ciliary action.Transportability ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsViscous-only samples in the low range of concentration (LBG 0.5%) did not maintain their shape and dispersed on the epithelial surface and were not propelled by ciliary action. Viscous-only samples in a higher concentration range (LBG 1.0%) maintained their shape and were transported very slowly by ciliary action, approximately five times slower than control.Thread formation ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsNon-viscous, non-elastic samples and the viscous-only samples did not produce any measurable spinnability in the Filancemeter. Working with samples of viscoelastic MS, we attained repeatable lengths of the filament in the low range (1 – 10 mm) and high range (30 – 50 mm) values in the Filancemeter, but found it difficult to consistently obtain medium ranges (11 – 29 mm), even using different combinations of viscosity and elasticity in MS. Elasticity of the crosslinked MS (length of the filament) increased in a direct proportion to the volume (1.5 μL, 15 μL and 150 μL) of 0.1 M added borate (Figure 2).Thread formation ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsPaired T-testing showed significant differences in thread formation when comparing the three added volumes. The Newman-Keuls test also indicated a significant difference (p < 0.05) in thread formation of the MS when comparing medium added volume (15 μL) to high volume (150 μL) of sodium tetraborate. Also, the Newman-Keuls test indicated a very significant difference (p < 0.01) in thread formation when comparing low added volume (1.5 μL) to high volume (150 μL) of borate.Thread formation ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsThe average linear velocity transport rate by ciliary action of crosslinked mucus simulant in the frog palate was approximately 60 percent (46% – 76%) as effective as native mucus transport used as control (100%) when different volumes (1.5 μL – 150 μL) of 0.1 M sodium tetraborate were applied. When different volumes of lower concentration borate (0.01 M) were applied, the transport velocity rate was no more than 30 percent (13% – 30%) as effective as control.""Cough clearance"" ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsNon-viscous, non-elastic MS samples (water) placed at various distances from the mouth of the artificial airway and exposed to a simulated cough maneuver had a high degree of dispersion onto the bullseye target.""Cough clearance"" ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsA sample of approximately 0.5 mL of crosslinked MS stained with Coomassie Blue was loaded inside the detachable portion of the artificial airway and then weighed in a microbalance. The cough machine was triggered and the detachable portion with the remaining aliquot of the sample not expelled by the cough maneuver was immediately weighed again. The amount of MS expelled from the artificial airway increased in direct proportion to the volume of 0.1 M sodium tetraborate added (Figure 3). Paired T-test analysis showed there exists a significant difference comparing the volume of MS sample expelled with increasing volume of 0.1 M added borate. The Newman-Keuls test indicated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the weight of MS expelled from the SCM when comparing low added volume (1.5 μL of XL ""B"") to high volume (150 μL of XL ""B"").""Cough clearance"" ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsMS loaded in the simulated airway and exposed to high-speed airflow interaction (simulated cough) broke up into multiple droplets of various sizes that were expelled in the form of a cloud of aerosol that landed on the target. Some portions of the MS expelled did not reach the target but landed on pieces of paper placed below, above and along the lateral sides of the corridor between the mouth and the target. The amount of aerosol striking the target and the amount of fine aerosol decreased progressively with added volume of crosslinking agent (Figure 4).""Cough clearance"" ::: Effects of sodium tetraborate ::: ResultsThe volume of XL ""B"" added to the MS sample was inversely related to the number of droplets formed after a cough maneuver and airflow interaction; the larger the volume added, the fewer droplets were formed. It was also observed that as the added volume of XL ""B"" (borate) increased, the size of the droplets formed after the airflow interaction increased; hence few, big cohesive droplets were formed, which did not reach the target but did fall in the paper placed immediately below the exit. The proportion of MS sample remaining in the ""airway"" after a cough maneuver correspondingly decreased with increasing added volume of crosslinking agent (from 53% for 1.5 μL to 40% for 15 μL to just 4% for 150 μL added sodium tetraborate).Calcium chloride effects ::: ResultsXL ""C"" (calcium chloride 5 μL) applied topically to our ex vivo frog palate model, causes mucus ""clumping"" without modifying the normal physical appearance of the ciliated surface when compared with ciliated surface exposed to frog Ringer solution (Figure 5).Calcium chloride effects ::: ResultsDirect application (5 μL) of three concentrations (0.001 M, 0.01 M, 0.1 M) of CaCl2 on the frog palate seems to moderately slow the way that native frog mucus is transported by ciliary action in the epithelial model (Figure 6). The Newman-Keuls analog procedure showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) of MTV of frog mucus samples only when the lowest concentration was applied, compared to the other concentrations and to the Frog Ringer control.DiscussionIn this study we have acquired preliminary evidence that the use of mucomodulators yields acceptable mucociliary clearance in an ex vivo epithelial model, increases ""expectoration"" in a model system, and yet achieves a desired target of a significant reduction in fine aerosol formation. We have also obtained graphic evidence that one of our mucomodulator agents, calcium chloride, which increases the concentration of divalent cations, in fact increases the interaction of the ion crosslinks in the frog mucus, resulting in modification of the physical structure of the mucous layer. This action suggests that the aerosolizability of the mucus or the ability to form tiny droplets may be decreased.DiscussionTo enhance the validity of the obtained results, we formulated an artificial mucus according to King [19] that displayed physical properties of viscosity, elasticity, reproducible thread formation and transportability in a ciliated epithelium within an acceptable range that most closely simulates airway mucus. The aerosolizability of MS was modified by increasing its cohesivity, thereby reducing the number of particles expelled from the SCM while interfering minimally with its clearance on the frog palate. An unexpected finding is that MS crosslinking increased ""expectoration"". Rubin & Van der Schans [21] stated, ""If an intervention is thought to have a directly measurable effect on sputum properties or on sputum clearability and if these changes cannot be demonstrated in vitro, it is unlikely that they will be observed in clinical trials.""DiscussionResults presented in this article and obtained thus far from our model system – mucous gel simulant, artificial airway, simulated cough function and ex vivo epithelial model – are limited but striking, and clearly support our mucomodulator approach. We were encouraged to continue with an in vivo mammalian model that will be presented independently (18). We expect that similar results will eventually be observed in clinical trials. Results from this study suggest that the mucomodulators tested appear not to affect the morphology or function of the mucociliary apparatus.DiscussionWe have designed a new mucomodulator therapy – aiming to change the physical properties of ASF to enhance the clearance of mucus from the respiratory tract, as well as to optimize aspects of lung defense that depend on the mucous layer. Mucomodulators work differently than mucolytics, since the latter were designed to disrupt the structural macromolecules that give respiratory tract mucus its physical characteristics, and from other agents designed to increase mucus flow by stimulating ciliary activity or improving periciliary fluid hydration. As used here, mucomodulators act to increase the cohesivity of airway mucus simulants. Mucomodulator therapy to combat mucus retention may become a major consideration in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases in which mucus hypersecretion and impaired airway clearance produce symptoms [11], and require adequate and novel secretion management. With the mucomodulator approach, we intend to adjust or regulate the mucin macromolecules that give respiratory mucus its physical characteristics in order to minimize the aerosolization that facilitates transmission of airborne diseases. It should be noted that it is not ""normal"" to cough and aerosolize particles that can be breathed in by others, although it is common. Thus a potential therapy that could reduce this tendency to aerosolize particles when coughing should be considered a form of modulation in the sense of restoring a balance or state of homeostasis.DiscussionCellular debris and other byproducts of infection contribute to make more difficult the clearance of infected mucus in CF patients, requiring antibiotics and mucolytic therapy. These approaches have helped to reduce the mortality rate in CF and other patients; however, there still remains a long way to go to reduce transmission of pathogens in non-infected subjects.DiscussionWe have invented a novel and non-intuitive approach to improving airway mucus clearance by adding crosslinks in a selective and controlled manner through a specialized new generation of mucomodulators. If further testing bears out our initial findings, it could lead to treatments that would reduce the rate of morbidity and improve the quality of life of individuals who have difficulties with airways secretions management.DiscussionEssentially, we have found preliminary evidence that certain mucomodulators that increase cohesive interactions between mucin macromolecules lead to a mucus that is more easily clearable, most likely by airflow-dependent mechanisms, as suggested by results obtained from our SCM The latter is a preliminary answer to a recurring question from lung experts: that using this approach could ""gum up"" the airway secretions. Such an improvement in mucus quality related to clearance would benefit many, if not most, patients with chronic airway disease, including those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who depend in whole or in part on airflow clearance mechanisms to maintain airway hygiene [13,22]. Further work is needed in clarifying the mechanisms involved in the clearance of the airway secretions.DiscussionThis novel approach might be of particular importance for those in the ICU or those with spinal cord lesions who require assisted ventilation. At the same time, increasing the cohesiveness in this manner leads to a reduction in fine aerosol formation during expectoration – a clear advantage in helping to control the spread of airborne infections. This new approach may be applicable to a range of infectious disease threats occurring naturally like the feared next flu pandemic or the possible deliberate use of biological agents.DiscussionThere are some additional critical advantages of this novel technology: Health Canada and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies have already approved the selected compounds for pharmaceutical use in humans. If any of these compounds (or a combination thereof) is judged suitable for clinical trials, established safety data could be utilized to fulfill some of the regulatory requirements for pre-clinical studies.DiscussionSome areas of applicability would include transmission prevention of clinically and epidemiologically important pathogens like M. tuberculosis and MDR-TB, in the feared flu pandemic and SARS-CoV, as well as P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Our mucomodulators would most likely represent containment for transmission of respiratory pathogens especially during outbreaks, allowing strategic sectors of society to be protected and remain functional, like the health system, law enforcement, service providers, as well as the work force.DiscussionSome other critical advantages of this novel technology are: Our low cost mucomodulators will not need to undergo constant development and reformulation due to viral or bacteria mutation or resistance. The technology is designed to act on the host rather than the causative organism, which will provide more longevity to it. The compounds under consideration are less perishable than vaccines, amenable to distribution, particularly in warm climates, and simple to manufacture to even allow for rapid response in outbreak situations. In addition, some of the concept testing could involve veterinary trials in airborne animal diseases, an aspect which we are also exploring.DiscussionIn model studies using vegetable polysaccharides, sodium tetraborate preferentially raises elasticity relative to viscosity, and current knowledge prior to the development of mucomodulators indicated that tetraborate solutions would favour mucociliary clearability at the expense of cough clearability and aerosolizability [12] Now, it appears that cough clearability and aerosolizability are both linked to cohesivity, but in opposite senses, at least within the range of the current study. Thus it appears that sodium tetraborate solutions, by altering mucous gel cohesivity, can decrease aerosolizability (fine aerosol formation during coughing) while increasing cough clearability (bulk clearance of mucus).DiscussionIn summary, the mucomodulator technology is innovative in that it represents a reversal in current thinking about respiratory disease management. The resulting product will be an unprecedented type of tool in airway hygiene, in secretion management as well as in prevention of droplet-spread illnesses, close person-to-person-contact and airborne transmission – a safe, efficacious, non-vaccine preventative therapy.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Pre-publication historyThe pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:Pre-publication history"
The health impacts of globalisation: a conceptual framework,"Good health for all populations has become an accepted international goal and we can state that there have been broad gains in life expectancy over the past century. But health inequalities between rich and poor persist, while the prospects for future health depend increasingly on the relative new processes of globalisation. In the past globalisation has often been seen as a more or less economic process. Nowadays it is increasingly perceived as a more comprehensive phenomenon, which is shaped by a multitude of factors and events that are reshaping our society rapidly. This paper describes a conceptual framework for the effects of globalisation on population health. The framework has two functions: serving as 'think-model', and providing a basis for the development of future scenarios on health.IntroductionTwo recent and comprehensive frameworks concerning globalisation and health are the ones developed by Woodward et al. [1], and by Labonte and Togerson [2]. The effects that are identified by Woodward et al. [1] as most critical for health are mainly mediated by economic factors. Labonte and Torgerson [2] primarily focus on the effects of economic globalisation and international governance. In our view, however, the pathways from globalisation to health are more complex. Therefore, a conceptual framework for the health effects of the globalisation process requires a more holistic approach and should be rooted in a broad conception of both population health and globalisation. The presented framework is developed in the following three steps: 1) defining the concept of population health and identifying its main determinants, 2) defining the concept of globalisation and identifying its main features and 3) constructing the conceptual model for globalisation and population health.Population healthAs the world around us is becoming progressively interconnected and complex, human health is increasingly perceived as the integrated outcome of its ecological, social-cultural, economic and institutional determinants. Therefore, it can be seen as an important high-level integrating index that reflects the state-and, in the long term, the sustainability-of our natural and socio-economic environments [3]. This paper primarily focuses on the physical aspects of population health like mortality and physical morbidity.Population healthOur identification of the most important factors influencing health is primarily based on a comprehensive analysis of a diverse selection of existing health models (see Huynen et al [4] for more details). We argue that the nature of the determinants and their level of causality can be combined into a basic framework that conceptualises the complex multi-causality of population health. In order to differentiate between health determinants of different nature, we will make the traditional distinction between social-cultural, economic, environmental and institutional factors. These factors operate at different hierarchical levels of causality, because they have different positions in the causal chain. The chain of events leading to a certain health outcome includes both proximal and distal causes; proximal factors act directly to cause disease or health gains, and distal determinants are further back in the causal chain and act via (a number of) intermediary causes [5]. In addition, we also distinguish contextual determinants. These can be seen as the macro-level conditions shaping the distal and proximal health determinants; they form the context in which the distal and proximal factors operate and develop.Population healthSubsequently, a further analysis of the selected health models and an intensive literature study resulted in a wide-ranging overview of the health determinants that can be fitted within this framework (Figure 1 and Table 1). We must keep in mind, however, that determinants within and between different domains and levels interact along complex and dynamic pathways to 'produce' health at the population level. Additionally, health in itself can also influence its multi-level, multi-nature determinants; for example, ill health can have a negative impact on economic development.GlobalisationThere is more and more agreement on the fact that globalisation is an extremely complex phenomenon; it is the interactive co-evolution of multiple technological, cultural, economic, institutional, social and environmental trends at all conceivable spatiotemporal scales. Hence, Rennen and Martens [6] define contemporary globalisation as an intensification of cross-national cultural, economic, political, social and technological interactions that lead to the establishment of transnational structures and the global integration of cultural, economic, environmental, political and social processes on global, supranational, national, regional and local levels. Although somewhat complex, this definition is in line with the view on globalisation in terms of deterritorialisation and explicitly acknowledges the multiple dimensions involved.GlobalisationHowever, the identification of all possible health effects of the globalisation process goes far beyond the current capacity of our mental ability to capture the dynamics of our global system; due to our ignorance and interdeterminacy of the global system that may be out of reach forever [7]. In order to focus our conceptual framework, we distinguish-with the broader definition of globalisation in mind-the following important features of the globalisation process: (the need for) new global governance structures, global markets, global communication and diffusion of information, global mobility, cross-cultural interaction, and global environmental changes (Table 2) (see Huynen et al. [4] for more details).Conceptual model for globalisation and healthWe have identified (the need for) global governance structures, global markets, global communication and the diffusion of information, global mobility, cross-cultural interaction, and global environmental changes as important features of globalisation. Based on Figure 1 and Table 1, it can be concluded that these features all operate at the contextual level of health determination and influence distal factors such as health(-related) policies, economic development, trade, social interactions, knowledge, and the provision of ecosystem goods and services. In turn, these changes in distal factors have the potential to affect the proximal health determinants and, consequently, health. Our conceptual framework for globalisation and health links the above-mentioned features of the globalisation process with the identified health determinants. This exercise results in Figure 2.Conceptual model for globalisation and healthFigure 3, subsequently, shows that within the developed framework, several links between the specific features of globalisation and health can be derived. These important links between globalisation and health are discussed in the following sections. It is important to note that Figure 3 primarily focuses on the relationships in the direction from globalisation to health. This does not mean, however, that globalisation is an autonomous process: globalisation is influenced by many developments at the other levels, although these associations are not included in the Figure for reasons of simplification. In addition, the only feedback that is included in Figure 3 concerns the institutional response. One also has to keep in mind that determinants within the distal level and within the proximal level also interact with each other, adding complexity to our model (see Huynen et al. 4 for more details and examples of important intralevel relationships).Health(-related) policies ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsGlobal governance structures are gaining more and more importance in formulating health(-related) policies (Figure 3; arrow 1). According to Dodgson et al. [8], the most important organisations in global health governance are the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB). The latter plays an important role in the field of global health governance as it acknowledges the importance of good health for economic development and focuses on reaching the Millennium Development Goals [9]. The WB also influenced health(-related) policies together with the International Monetary Funds (IMF) through the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) (e.g. see Hong [10]). In order to give a more central role to pro-poor growth considerations in providing assistance to low-income countries, the IMF and WB introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy approach in 1999 [11]. In addition, the policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are also increasingly influencing population health [10,12-14]. Fidler [15] argues that 'from the international legal perspective, the centre of power for global health governance has shifted from WHO to the WTO'. Opinions differ with regard to whether the WTO agreements provide sufficient possibilities to protect the population from the adverse (health) effects of free trade or not [16]. In 2002, the WTO ruled that the French ban on the import of all products containing asbestos was legal on health grounds, despite protests from Canada [17,18]. However, protecting citizens against health risks remains difficult, as health standards often need to be supported by sound scientific evidence before trade can be restricted (see e.g. the WTO ruling against the European trade barrier concerning hormone-treated meat [19,20]).Health(-related) policies ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsAnother important development is the growing number of public-private partnerships for health, as governments increasingly attract private sector companies to undertake tasks that were formerly the responsibility of the public sector. At the global level, public-private partnerships are more and more perceived as a possible new form of global governance [12] and could have important implications for health polices, but also for health-related policies.Economic development ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsOpinions differ with regard to the economic benefits of economic globalisation (Figure 3; arrow 2). On the one side, 'optimists' argue that global markets facilitate economic growth and economic security, which would benefit health. They base themselves on the results of several studies that argue that inequities between and within countries have decreased due to globalisation (e.g. see Frankel [21], Ben David [22], Dollar and Kraay [23]). Additionally, it is argued that although other nations or households might become richer, absolute poverty is reduced and that this is beneficial for the health of the poor [24]. On the other side, 'pessimists' are worried about the health effects of the exclusion of nations and persons from the global market. They argue that the risk of exclusion from the growth dynamics of economic globalisation is significant in the developing world [25]. In fact, notwithstanding some spectacular growth rates in the 1980's, especially in east Asia, incomes per capita declined in almost 70 countries during the same period [26]. Many worry about what will happen to the countries that cannot participate in the global market as successful as others.Trade ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsDue to the establishment of global markets and a global trading system, there has been a continuing increase in world trade (Figure 3; arrow 2). According to the WTO, total trade multiplied by a factor 14 between 1950 and 1997 [27]. Today all countries trade internationally and they trade significant proportions of their national income; around 20 percent of world output is being traded. The array of products being traded is wide-ranging; from primary commodities to manufactured goods. Besides goods, services are increasingly being traded as well [28]. In addition to legal trade transactions, illegal drug trade is also globalising, as it circumvents national and international authority and takes advantage of the global finance systems, new information technologies and transportation.Social interactions: migration ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsDue to the changes in the infrastructures of transportation and communication, human migration has increased at unprecedented rates (Figure 3; arrow 3) [28]. According to Held et al. [28] tourism is one of the most obvious forms of cultural globalisation and it illustrates the increasing time-space compression of current societies. However, travel for business and pleasure constitutes only a fraction of total human movement. Other examples of people migrating are missionaries, merchant marines, students, pilgrims, militaries, migrant workers and Peace Corps workers [28,29]. Besides these forms of voluntary migration, resettlement by refugees is also an important issue. However, since the late 1970s, the concerns regarding the economic, political, social and environmental consequences of migration has been growing and many governments are moving towards more restrictive immigration policies [30].Social interactions: conflicts ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsThe tragic terrorist attacks in New York and Washington D.C. in September 2001 fuelled the already ongoing discussions on the link between globalisation and conflicts. Globalisation can decrease the risk on tensions and conflicts, as societies become more and more dependent on each other due the worldwide increase in global communication, global mobility and cross-cultural interactions (Figure 3; arrow 3). Others argue that the resistance to globalisation has resulted in religious fundamentalism and to worldwide tensions and intolerance [31]. In addition, the intralevel relationships at the distal level play a very important role, because many developments in other distal factors that have been associated with the globalisation process are also believed to increase the risk on conflicts. In other words, the globalisation-induced risk on conflict is often mediated by changes in other factors at the distal level [4].Social interactions: social equity and social networks ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsCultural globalisation (global communication, global mobility, cross-cultural interaction) can also influence cultural norms and values about social solidarity and social equity (Figure 3; arrow 3). It is feared that the self-interested individualism of the marketplace spills over into cultural norms and values resulting in increasing social exclusion and social inequity. Exclusion involves disintegration from common cultural processes, lack of participation in social activities, alienation from decision-making and civic participation and barriers to employment and material sources [32]. Alternatively, a socially integrated individual has many social connections, in the form of both intimate social contacts as well as more distal connections [33]. On the other hand, however, the geographical scale of social networks is increasing due to global communications and global media. The women's movement, the peace movement, organized religion and the environmental movement are good examples of such transnational social networks. Besides these more formal networks, informal social networks are also gaining importance, as like-minded people are now able to interact at distance through, for example, the Internet. In addition, the global diffusion of radio and television plays an important role in establishing such global networks [28]. The digital divide between poor and rich, however, can result in social exclusion from the global civil society.Knowledge ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsThe knowledge capital within a population is increasingly affected by developments in global communication and global mobility (Figure 3: arrow 3). The term 'globalisation of education' suggests getting education into every nook and cranny of the globe. Millions of people now acquire part of their knowledge from transworld textbooks, due to the supraterritoriality in publishing. Because of new technologies, most colleges and universities are able to work together with academics from different countries, students have ample opportunities to study abroad and 'virtual campuses' have been developed. The diffusion of new technologies has enabled researchers to gather and process data in no time resulting in increased amounts of empirical data [34]. New technologies have even broadened the character of literacy. Scholte [34] argues that 'in many line of work the ability to use computer applications has become as important as the ability to read and write with pen and paper. In addition, television, film and computer graphics have greatly enlarged the visual dimensions of communication. Many people today 'read' the globalised world without a book'. Overall, it is expected that the above-discussed developments will also improve health training and health education (e.g. see Feachem [24] and Lee [35]).Ecosystem goods and services ::: Globalisation and distal health determinantsGlobal environmental changes can have profound effects on the provision of ecosystem goods and services to mankind (Figure 3; arrow 4). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [36] concludes that it is expected that climate change can result in significant ecosystem disruptions and threatens substantial damage to the earth's natural systems. In addition, several authors have addressed the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and it is agued that maintaining a certain level of biodiversity is necessary for the proper provision of ecosystem goods and services [37-40]. However, it is still unclear which ecosystem functions are primarily important to sustain our physical health. Basically, the following types of 'health functions' can be distinguished. First, ecosystems provide us with basic human needs like food, clean air, clean water and clean soils. Second, they prevent the spread of diseases through biological control. Finally, ecosystems provide us with medical and genetic resources, which are necessary to prevent or cure diseases [41].Health services ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsHealth services are increasingly influenced by globalisation-induced changes in health care policy (Figure 3; arrow 5), economic development and trade (Figure 3: arrow 6), and knowledge (Figure 3; arrow 7), but also by migration (3: arrow 7). Although the WHO aims to assist governments to strengthen health services, government involvement in health care policies has been decreasing and, subsequently, medical institutions are more and more confronted with the neoliberal economic model. Health is increasingly perceived as a private good leaving the law of the market to determine whose health is profitable for investment and whose health is not [10]. According to Collins [42] populations of transitional economies are no longer protected by a centralized health sector that provides universal access to everyone and some groups are even denied the most basic medical services. The U.S. and several Latin American countries have witnessed a decline in the accessibility of health care following the privatisation of health services [43].Health services ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsThe increasing trade in health services can have profound implications for provision of proper health care. Although it is perceived as to improve the consumer's choice, some developments are believed to have long-term dangers, such as establishing a two-tier health system, movement of health professionals from the public sector to the private sector, inequitable access to health care and the undermining of national health systems [10,12]. The illegal trading of drugs and the provision of access to controlled drugs via the Internet are potential health risks [44]. In addition, the globalisation process can also result in a 'brain-drain' in the health sector as a result of labour migration from developing to developed regions.Health services ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsHowever, increased economic growth is generally believed to enhance improvements in health care. Increased (technological) knowledge resulting from the diffusion of information can further improve the treatment and prevention of all kinds of illnesses and diseases.Social environment ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsThe central mechanism that links personal affiliations to health is 'social support,' the transfer from one person to another of instrumental, emotional and informational assistance [45]. Social networks and social integration are closely related to social support [46] and, as a result, globalisation-induced changes in social cohesion, integration and interaction can influence the degree of social support in a population (Figure 3; arrow 9). This link is, for example, demonstrated by Reeves [47], who discussed that social interactions through the Internet influenced the coping ability of HIV-positive individuals through promoting empowerment, augmenting social support and facilitating helping others. Alternatively, social exclusion is negatively associated with social support.Social environment ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsAnother important factor in the social environment is violence, which often is the result of the complex interplay of many factors (Figure 3; arrows 5, 8 and 9). The WHO [48] argues that globalisation gives rise to obstacles as well as benefits for violence prevention. It induces changes in protective factors like social cohesion and solidarity, knowledge and education levels, and global violence prevention activities such as the implementation of international law and treaties designed to reduce violence (e.g. social protection). On the other hand, it also influences important risk factors associated with violence such as social exclusion, income inequality, collective conflict, and trade in alcohol, drugs or firearms.Lifestyle ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsDue to the widespread flow of people, information and ideas, lifestyles also spread throughout the world. It is already widely acknowledged and demonstrated that several modern behavioural factors such as an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol misuse and the use of illicit drugs are having a profound impact on human health [49-52] (Table 3). Individuals respond to the range of healthy as well as unhealthy lifestyle options and choices available in a community [53], which are in turn determined by global trade (Figure 3; arrow 8), economic development (Figure 3; arrow 8) and social interactions (Figure 3; arrow 9).Lifestyle ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsAlthough the major chronic diseases are not transmittable via an infectious agent, the behaviours that predispose to these diseases can be communicated by advertising, product marketing and social interactions [54]. Global trade and marketing developments drive, for example, the nutrition transition towards diets with high proportions of salt, saturated fat and sugars [51,53]. Another example is the worldwide spread of tobacco consumption as transnational tobacco companies take advantage of the potential for growth in developing countries [51,55]. Additionally, the scale of cigarette smuggling poses a considerable global threat to the efforts to control tobacco consumption [44]. Illegal trade in illicit drugs poses similar problems. At the same time, the alcohol industry is almost as globalised as the tobacco industry [56].Lifestyle ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsHowever, health education can play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles by improving an individual's knowledge about the health effects of different lifestyle options (Figure 3; arrow 9). Besides health education, (global) policies can also directly discourage unhealthy behaviour by means of economic incentives (e.g. charging excise on tobacco) or other legislation (Figure 3; arrow 5).Physical environment: infectious diseases pathogens ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsThe spread of infectious diseases is probably one of the most mentioned health effects of globalisation and past disease outbreaks have been linked to factors that are related to the globalisation process (see e.g. Newcomb [57]). The recent outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) demonstrates the potential of new infectious diseases to spread rapidly in today's world, increasing the risk of a global pandemic. The combination of movement of goods (Figure 3; arrow 10) and people (Figure 3; arrow 11), and profound changes affecting ecosystem goods and services (Figure 3; arrow 12) all contribute to increased risk of disease spread [57]. For example, the globalisation of food production, trade and consumption has been associated with the increased spread and transmission of food born diseases [57,58]. Diseases like HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B can also spread through trade in infected biological products (e.g. blood) [44].Physical environment: infectious diseases pathogens ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsEnhanced knowledge and new technologies will improve the surveillance of infectious diseases and monitoring of antibiotic resistance [24,35] (Figure 3; arrow 11). Globalisation potentially increases the speed of responses in some cases. Wilson [29] states that responding to disease emergence requires a global perspective-both conceptually and geographically-as the current global situation favours the outbreak and rapid spread of infectious disease. As a result, the policies and actions undertaking by the WHO are becoming increasingly important in controlling infectious diseases at a global level (Figure 3; arrow 5). For instance, the WHO played a critical role in controlling SARS by means of global alerts, geographically specific travel advisories and monitoring [59].Food ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsFood trade has become an increasingly important factor with regard to food security worldwide (Figure 3; arrow 10). At present, however, the developed countries usually subsidise their agricultural sectors. Current liberalisation policies are expected to have profound implications on food trade and, subsequently food security [60]. Some argue that the resulting free trade will create access to better and cheaper food supplies via food imports and can stimulate more efficient use of the world's resources as well as the production of food in regions that are more suitable to do so [60,61]. Free trade permits food consumption to grow faster than domestic food production in countries where there are constraints on increasing the latter. Accelerated economic growth can also contribute to food security (Figure 3; arrow 10) [60]. Others, however, argue that the forces of globalisation in fact endanger food security (e.g. see Lang [62]) and that countries should strive to become more self-sufficient [60]. For many countries the increasing dependence on food imports goes hand in hand with a higher vulnerability to shocks arising in global markets, which can affect import capacity and access to food imports [60]. Many food insecure countries are not able to earn enough with exporting goods in order to pay for the needed food imports [63].Food ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsAt the global level, there are increasing international efforts to achieve widespread food security (Figure 3; arrow 5). For instance, the right to adequate food is directly addressed in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In 1996, the World Food Summit reaffirmed the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food. In case of extreme food-insecurity and insufficient import capacity, food aid may be provided in order to supplement the scarce food imports. Globalisation can affect food security by enhancing the knowledge of foreign nations about the usefulness of food aid (Figure 3; arrow 11) [60].Food ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsBesides food trade, one can also deal with the mismatch between demand and supply by increasing food production in food-short regions. The globalisation process can increase food security by facilitating the worldwide implementation of better technologies and improved knowledge (e.g. irrigation technologies, research on genetically modified food) (Figure 3; arrow 11). At the same time, the natural resource base for food production is increasingly threatened (Figure 3; arrow 12). Finally conflicts are, of course, a threat to food security and it is expected that food security in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, will not increase without the establishment of political instability (Figure 3; arrow 11) [64].Water ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsThe effects of globalisation are also raising concerns over water security. The current globalisation process is accompanied by privatisation policies affecting the provision of water [65] (Figure 3; arrow 5). Governments and international financial institutions promote privatisation, as they believe it will promote market competition and efficiency. However, others are less optimistic about the effects of privatisation. In fact, some cases show that prices and inequalities in access even rise [66]. It is also argued that water, with vital importance socially, culturally, and ecologically, 'cannot be protected by purely market forces' [65]. On a global scale, there are increasing efforts to set up global guidelines or policies with regard to fresh water (Figure 3; arrow 5), however none of the international declarations and conference statements requires states to actual meet individual's water requirements [67].Water ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsThe virtual trade of water is also believed to be of increasing importance (Figure 3; arrow 10). The water that is used in the production process of a commodity is called the 'virtual water' contained in that commodity. Therefore, the increasing global trade of commodities is accompanied by an increasing global trade in virtual water. The global volume of virtual water embedded in crop and livestock products traded between nations is estimated to be 1400 billion cubic metres per year [68].Water ::: Globalisation and proximal health determinantsIn addition, the globalisation process can increase water security by facilitating the worldwide implementation of better technologies and improved knowledge (Figure 3; arrow 11). At the same time, the natural resource base is increasingly threatened as, for example, global climate change and deforestation profoundly affect our ecosystems ability to provide us with sufficient and adequate fresh water (Figure 3; arrow 12).ConclusionGlobalisation is causing profound and complex changes in the very nature of our society, bringing new opportunities as well as risks. In addition, the effects of globalisation are causing a growing concern for our health, and the intergenerational equity implied by 'sustainable development' forces us to think about the right of future generations to a healthy environment and a healthy life.ConclusionDespite some empirical research efforts indicating the links between the globalisation process and specific health impacts, the present weakness in empirical evidence on the multiple links between globalisation and health is still a problem [44]. The described conceptual framework could give a meaningful contribution to further empirical research by serving as a well-structured 'think-model' or 'concept map'. It clearly demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach towards globalisation and health is required, which draws upon the knowledge from relevant fields such as, for example, medicine, epidemiology, sociology, political sciences, (health) education, environmental sciences and economics.ConclusionIn addition, the exploration of possible future health impacts of different globalisation pathways by means of scenarios analysis could provide a useful contribution to the ongoing discussions on globalisation and health [4]. Scenarios can be described as 'plausible but simplified descriptions of how the future may develop, according to a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces and relationships' [69]. Recent research showed, however, that the health dimension is largely missing in existing global scenarios [70]. The developed framework for globalisation and population health has contributed to the understanding of future health implications and the model is, therefore, considered to be a useful tool to structure future scenario studies on the health implications of the globalisation process.ConclusionTo conclude, the framework provides valuable insights in how to organise the complexity involved in studying the health effects resulting from globalisation. We claim that our approach has several beneficial characteristics. First, it is embedded in a holistic approach towards globalisation; in this paper we perceive globalisation as an overarching process in which simultaneously many different processes take place in many societal domains. In addition, the conceptual framework is embedded in a holistic approach towards population health. As a result, our model explicitly visualises that globalisation affects the institutional, economic, social-cultural and ecological determinants of population health and that the globalisation process mainly operates at the contextual level, while influencing health through the more distal and proximal determinants.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
The potential impact of the next influenza pandemic on a national primary care medical workforce,"It is probably only a matter of time before the next influenza pandemic. The only uncertainties are its timing and impact. Effective planning for public health interventions before and during a pandemic is likely to reduce its impact [1]. A pandemic is likely to be extremely disruptive, particularly for the health sector. Not only will there be a surge in demand for health services (preventive as well as curative), but the health workforce is likely to have higher exposure and incidence rates.BackgroundWe estimated for the impact of pandemic influenza on the primary care medical workforce (i.e., general practitioners) for a single country – New Zealand. The estimates inform planning for the pandemic as well as for other new emerging infectious disease threats, including those from bioterrorism, by providing some estimates for the level of ""surge capacity"" that must be built into the health sector.BackgroundNew Zealand has approximately 23 000 health practitioners plus around 30 000 support workers delivering services in the community [2]. Around 40% of its medical practitioners and 23% of its nurses work in primary care settings. The population to general practitioner (GP) ratio varies considerably across different territorial authorities from about 450 to about 2300 [3]. New Zealand's Primary Health Care Strategy [4], released in 2001, places primary care at the centre of the country's health system. It defines a future for primary care where, increasingly, primary care and public health strategies are expected to be coordinated and intermeshed, with the overall objective of improving population health and reducing health inequalities.BackgroundThe Strategy led to the formation of new non-profit umbrella organisations, called Primary Health Organisations (PHOs) [5]. PHOs are responsible for ensuring that their constituent general practices and community organisations provide comprehensive, continuing and coordinated care to their enrolled populations, including health promotion and prevention programmes. Increasingly, PHOs are held accountable to their funders for a range of population health outcomes. The development of PHOs mirrors, to an extent, the development over the past five years of primary care groups and trusts in the United Kingdom [6].The FluAid model ::: MethodsThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed a relatively simple deterministic model, ""FluAid"" (on freely available software), for analysing the impact of future influenza pandemics [7]. The output of the model is the number of deaths, hospitalisations, and illnesses requiring medical consultations for a wave of pandemic influenza. These outputs were used to estimate lost workdays in this analysis. The model assumes that no public health interventions (e.g., limitations of movement, vaccine, or antiviral drugs) are used to control disease spread. Specific details on the FluAid software and the various assumptions in the model are detailed on the CDC website [8] and other documents [9,10]. This model has been used in other studies [11-13].Baseline model assumptions ::: MethodsThe default values used in FluAid were used for the mortality rates, the hospitalisation rates and the rates of illness. The default values for the incidence rates of clinical illness were also used (i.e., 15% and 35% for ""most likely"" results). Working doctors are likely to be in better health than the general population (the ""healthy worker effect""), and have fewer risk factors associated with severe sequelae from influenza infection. For example, they are probably far less likely to have chronic respiratory disease, since they have markedly lower smoking rates in New Zealand than the rest of the population [14]. Therefore, the proportion of doctors assumed to be in the ""high-risk"" category was arbitrarily halved (i.e., from 14.4% for 19–64-year-olds down to 7.2%). This may be overly conservative, but we wished to systematically err towards underestimating the impact of a pandemic on this workforce in the baseline model.Baseline model assumptions ::: MethodsThe length of time associated with hospitalisation (average of eight days) and from clinical illness (two days) was based on the United States data in a previously published model [10]. In addition to this, it was assumed that there would be one day of convalescence for clinical illness and three days convalescence after hospitalisation (i.e., before returning to work). To determine the working days lost, these figures were adjusted by the proportion of a typical week that is spent at work (i.e., five out of seven days).Population data ::: MethodsThe latest available national figure for the total number of registered medical practitioners working in primary care was 3074 (i.e., those working four or more hours per week in 2002 and who are classified as working in ""general practice"" or ""primary care"") [15]. The average hours worked per week by these doctors is 42 hours, and it was assumed that they would work full time during the pandemic period (unless affected by illness).Time distribution ::: MethodsThe FluAid model does not consider the time frame of the pandemic within an affected region. The length of influenza epidemics is highly variable [16,17]. For the baseline analysis the distribution of cases and a duration of eight weeks was used, based on the results of a stochastically simulated influenza pandemic [18].""More severe"" scenario assumptions ::: MethodsFor this scenario the pandemic wave was assumed to last only six weeks and the upper range ""maximum"" values from the FluAid model were used (for the 35% incidence rate scenario). The proportion of cases in the peak week was raised to 40% (from 32.3%), the upper limit of the days of hospitalisation was used (13 days [10]), and days lost from illness was doubled relative to the baseline model (i.e., to four days). In addition, it was assumed that every doctor would spend an average of 0.5 days during the pandemic wave period caring for sick relatives or household members.ResultsBaseline assumptions result in 584 to 1320 lost workdays for 15% and 35% incidence rates respectively (Table 1). The lost work time was 1.2% to 2.7% of maximal capacity at the time of estimated peak pandemic impact (week 4). An estimated 88% of lost workdays arose from illness not requiring hospitalisation, 8% from hospitalised cases, and 4% from deaths caused by influenza (when using the 35% incidence rate).ResultsThe ""more severe"" model inputs resulted in 3591 lost workdays (Table 2), with a loss of 9.3% of maximal capacity in the peak week and 2.9% over the six-week period. The lost workdays mainly arose from the impact of illness not requiring hospitalisation (64%), then the time spent caring for others (31%), the impact of hospitalisation (4%), and then the impact of premature death (1%).Impact on health and workdays ::: DiscussionThe model results suggest a substantial impact on general practitioners, even with very conservative assumptions. For the ""more severe"" scenario a mortality rate of 65 per 100 000 is predicted (albeit for just one pandemic wave). This is much less than the total population rate for the 1918 pandemic in New Zealand of 745 per 100 000 [19], but it is more than United States total population rates for the 1957 Asian flu pandemic (22 per 100 000) and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic (14 per 100 000) [20].Impact on health and workdays ::: DiscussionThe results suggest that the major contributor to lost workdays will be episodes of uncomplicated illness that do not require hospitalisation. If time spent caring for sick relatives is considered (i.e., as in the ""more severe"" scenario) then this also made a substantial contribution to the total workdays lost. The impact of lost workdays will be magnified by the increased demand on the medical workforce, as has recently been modelled for primary care consultations and hospitalisations in New Zealand [12], and for critical care services in both New Zealand and Australia [21].Implications for the health sector ::: DiscussionThere are several broad strategies to reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic on health care workers. First, infection control strategies aimed at doctors need to be in place. These measures include basic hygiene practices and also mask use may be appropriate (depending on risk [1]). Health authorities and doctors themselves could also stockpile and then use antivirals at the appropriate time. Such stockpiling has already commenced at a national level in New Zealand and various other countries [22]. Recent modelling work indicates that access to enough antivirals could substantially reduce the number of clinical cases and hospitalisations in the population [23].Implications for the health sector ::: DiscussionSecond, pandemic planning needs to include specific measures to maintain the functional capacity of health care workers, bearing in mind that the impact of an influenza pandemic is likely to vary between urban and rural areas. While exposure to infection may be less in relatively isolated rural areas, such areas generally have far less ""spare"" health care capacity, should GPs be incapacitated. General practices and health authorities can consider plans to provide care for the ill dependents of their medical staff so as to reduce absenteeism rates. Through other pandemic planning activities they can also potentially reduce the overall impact of a pandemic and hence demands on their staff. For example, rapid action at the start of the pandemic to cancel elective procedures could enhance workforce capacity. Establishing dedicated primary care assessment centres for patients with suspected influenza could also reduce overall GP workload.Implications for the health sector ::: DiscussionThird, strategies are needed to manage the psychological impact of pandemic influenza on health care workers. Surveys of such workers show that they report a lower willingness to report for duty for infectious diseases epidemics (SARS, smallpox) than for most other forms of catastrophic disasters (environmental disasters, mass casualty incidents) [24]. Experience with SARS also demonstrated the psychological importance of having well-designed policies and protocols in place. Even in situations where health care workers perceive themselves to be at increased risk, they report feeling reassured by simple protective measures based on sound epidemiological principles, when implemented in a timely manner [25]. A review of the foundations for a SARS preparedness and response plan has specifically highlighted the importance of both appropriate staffing and support [26].Implications for the health sector ::: DiscussionFourth, improving health sector surge capacity now would be desirable as the New Zealand health sector is often running at stretched capacity (e.g., especially emergency departments [27]). Expanding existing services such as the ""Healthline"" (a free telephone information service to the public staffed by nurses) may also be worthwhile. Similarly, active promotion of key websites with information on managing influenza (e.g., as per the CDC website [28]) could be publicised each winter season. All such measures would benefit the public prior to a pandemic as well as potentially reducing the demands on the medical workforce in the primary care and secondary care settings during a pandemic.Implications for the health sector ::: DiscussionFinally, a greater focus on the primary care nursing workforce would be of benefit. Following the implementation of the Primary Health Care Strategy there has been a rapid shift to capitation funding of general practices, and an attendant increased focus on team-based primary care (principally GPs and practice nurses). This trend raises the possibility of increasing substitution of GP work roles by nurses. This type of substitution has occurred for a decade or more in a range of community-governed non-profit practices and other capitation-funded practices [29,30]. A recent review of the medical workforce in New Zealand also highlights the potential efficiencies from some role shifting from doctors to other health workers [31]. Expanding such a non-medical health workforce, while also vulnerable to the infection during a pandemic, would provide a buffer for the GP workforce in the event of attrition of GP capacity.Limitations with the modelling ::: DiscussionThe uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza mean that estimating its future impact is problematic. This model could substantially underestimate the true impact because the new strain may be particularly infectious and/or virulent, and the incidence rate for clinical illness might be higher for doctors given their likely occupational risk [32]. For example, one review of nosocomial outbreaks reported a health care worker incidence rate to be as high as 60% [33]. Furthermore, doctors may be relatively slow to seek care for themselves – especially at the time of a national crisis when their professional obligations are greatest. Other parameters used in the modelling may also have been overly conservative, such as the extent of the healthy worker effect among doctors and the amount of time off work taken to care for sick relatives (which was zero in the baseline model and fairly small at 0.5 days in the ""more severe"" scenario). There was also no consideration in the model of absenteeism effects from fear of infection (e.g., in the case of particularly virulent strains). Indeed, this absenteeism effect could be more important than actual disease in reducing health sector capacity.Limitations with the modelling ::: DiscussionAlthough we consider that the baseline results are more likely to underestimate than to overestimate the impact of a future influenza pandemic, there are still plausible reasons why they could be overestimates. These include the following:Limitations with the modelling ::: Discussion• various international and national public health interventions (as recommended by WHO [1]) may reduce the impact of pandemic influenza;Limitations with the modelling ::: Discussion• at least for subsequent pandemic waves, an appropriate vaccine may be available;Limitations with the modelling ::: Discussion• antivirals could prevent infection and reduce morbidity amongst the medical workforce and the rest of the population [23];Limitations with the modelling ::: Discussion• improved treatment could lower hospitalisation and mortality rates (relative to the figures used in this model).Further research ::: DiscussionThis modelling could be further refined to address some of the limitations detailed above. Clarifying the prevalence of ""high-risk"" conditions among the medical workforce would be a particularly important refinement along with improving the estimates of time off work to care for relatives (or even absenteeism from fear of infection). Expanding such modelling to other parts of the health sector workforce is also desirable, along with exploring the extent that such research is generalisable to other threats (e.g., from other new emerging infectious threats, including those from bioterrorism).SummaryThis modelling work has a number of limitations and so these results could still substantially overestimate or underestimate the impact of the next influenza pandemic on the primary care medical workforce. Nevertheless, this modelling work highlights the importance of infection control strategies for health care workers, pandemic planning, and improving current health sector surge capacity.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsAll authors contributed to the writing and NW, MB and OM also contributed to the design.

"Patterns of HIV prevalence among injecting drug users in the cross-border area of Lang Son Province, Vietnam, and Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China","Both injecting drug use and HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) have become major international public health problems. HIV infection has been reported among IDUs in over 100 countries [1]. Travel by IDUs, particularly along drug distribution routes, appears to be a major mechanism for the spread of both injecting drug use and HIV among IDUs. HIV spread north [2] and south [3] from New York City along the East Coast in the U.S. Stimson [4], and Beyrer and colleagues [5] have reconstructed the spread of HIV among IDUs in South East Asia. Beyrer et al. used molecular epidemiology (mapping the different subtypes of HIV) in their reconstruction. A recent study by Kato and colleagues (2001) found patterns of HIV genetic subtyping consistent with cross-border transmission either from Vietnam to China or from China to Vietnam.BackgroundWhile these regional and country level analyses have great value in understanding the worldwide spread of HIV among IDUs, they have important limitations with respect to HIV prevention efforts. Reducing HIV spread by attempting to disrupt regional and country drug distribution routes may have the unintended consequence of displacing distribution to new routes, leading to additional spread of injecting drug use and HIV among IDUs.BackgroundSuccessful prevention efforts will be greatly facilitated by more detailed understanding of the spread of injecting drug use and transmission of HIV among IDUs within smaller geographic areas. Understanding of HIV transmission across international borders is particularly important, as few HIV prevention programs are coordinated across such borders. We present here data on injecting drug use and HIV among IDUs in the adjacent border provinces of Lang Son, Vietnam and Guangxi, China. HIV among IDUs was noted in this area in 1996 [6] and since then there has been substantial transmission among IDUs in both provinces. The present situation shows a clear geographic pattern, with the potential for additional spread across the border between the provinces and within each of the provinces.BackgroundThe data reported here were collected as part of baseline surveys of IDUs conducted before implementation of a cross-border HIV prevention intervention in Lang Son Province, Vietnam and-Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, Vietnam [7]. Figure 1 shows a map of the area, with the project sites – in Lang Son Province and in Ning Ming County.BackgroundThere is considerable official and entirely legal movement of commercial goods across the border in both directions. There are also semi-official and informal crossing points and pathways through the hills that permit local residents to cross the border with little or no regulation. Crossing the border is a regular aspect of life for many people who live near the border, for example, to attend market days in the larger villages. Drug dealers cross the border to sell drugs and drug users also cross to obtain drugs of higher purity and at better prices. The frequency of border crossing can vary, influenced by current price and purity of heroin, the ebb and flow of law enforcement activity and, factors such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China.BackgroundThere is also substantial trade and migratory employment in the region. Lang Son City, Aidian, and Puzhai (near Pingxiang) are bustling centers of legitimate cross-border trade, as well as drug trafficking and sex work. Many people cross the border daily and seasonally to find work and many are employed as porters in the cross-border trade. The region is home to many ethnic minority groups (e.g., Zhuang, Tay, Nung), some of whom live on both sides of the border (for example, the Zhuang in China and the Tay in Vietnam are the same ethnic group but are known by different names in the two countries). There is frequent intermarriage across the border, although this might be illegal and might lead to loss of nationality. Kinship ties, like migratory employment and trade, result in additional cross-border movement.Subject recruitment – China ::: MethodsIn Ning Ming County, a modified snowball/peer recruitment technique was used. The project peer educators sent recruiting letters to IDUs they knew personally, inviting them to come to a project center and participate in the survey. The IDUs who came to project centers for interviews were encouraged to recruit 2–3 additional participants. The research participants received 20 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.50) for the interview, 5 yuan for each additional male respondent recruited, and 10 yuan for each additional woman respondent recruited. The eligibility criteria were a minimum of 18 years of age and recent (in the past 6 months) drug injection.Subject recruitment – Vietnam ::: MethodsApproximately one-half of the sample was based on individuals initially selected from the lists of known IDUs in the project sites. The other half was based on participants initially selected from IDUs present at gathering or shooting places mapped by project staff as part of the initial project implementation. For the half of the sample based initially on registered lists, 10 clusters of 25 individuals each were selected by probability proportional to size (PPS) from the lists of IDUs in each commune. Then four IDUs were picked at random from each selected cluster and these referred others until the quota for the commune was reached.Subject recruitment – Vietnam ::: MethodsFor the portion of the sample selected initially at IDU gathering or shooting places, sample quotas for these places were determined by PPS based on the numbers of individuals observed at these places during the mapping phase. The interview team then revisited the selected places and chose four individuals at random from among those present at each place at that time (who were not necessarily those present during the mapping phase).Subject recruitment – Vietnam ::: MethodsThe Vietnamese participants were paid 30,000 Vietnamese dong (approximately US$2) for participating in the interview and HIV test.Informed consent ::: MethodsIn Vietnam, an oral informed consent was obtained for participation in the study, with the interviewer certifying that oral consent had been obtained. This procedure was requested by the Institutional Review Board of the National AIDS Standing Bureau in order to provide more assurance of confidentiality to prospective participants. In China, standard signed informed consents were obtained from all participants. Unique codes were constructed for each participant based on numeric date of birth and several letters representing, for example, the first letter of the mother's family name. (Construction of the record number was slightly different in the two countries.) The objective was to have a unique identifier that the participant could readily reconstruct if he or she lost the project participation card.Questionnaire ::: MethodsA structured instrument was used for the interviews, based on version 2b of the questionnaire being used in the World Health Organization's Drug Injection Study, Phase II [8]. Trained interviewers, primarily staff of the local health departments, conducted the interviews. The questionnaire covered demographics, drug use, injection and sexual risk behavior, HIV testing history, HIV and hepatitis knowledge, and cross-border travel patterns. A question on the number of times the subject had crossed the border in the 6 months prior to the interview was included.Questionnaire ::: MethodsThere are many factors which could influence the ""ease/difficulty"" in crossing an international border, including distance to the border, cost of transportation, time needed to reach the border, and the need to have official papers for crossing. It was not practical to measure all such factors. Instead, used simple physical distance (in kilometers) to the nearest border point. This gave five distance categories in Vietnam and three distance categories in China.Questionnaire ::: MethodsThe baseline survey was conducted in July 2002 in Vietnam and between July and September 2002 in China.HIV testing ::: MethodsThe survey included HIV antibody testing. Participants were given pre-test counseling and post-test counseling at local health centers. Blood was drawn at the time of the interviews by trained phlebotomists from local health departments. Participants were given a card with their unique identifier and returned to the local health center to receive their test results using this identification number. Indeed, they could only retrieve their results by using this number since blood samples were not otherwise labeled. In China, testing was by double ELISA (Vironostika HIV- Uni-form, Organon (Holland)) with confirmation of initial HIV-positive results by Western Blot (Genelabs Diagnostics). All testing was conducted at the laboratory of the Guangxi Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in Nanning. In Vietnam, testing was performed at the laboratory of the Lang Son Provincial Health Services using the Serodia SFD screening test (Biorad {France}) and double ELISA (Genescreen, Biorad (France); Vironostika, Organon [9]). This is the official protocol of the Ministry of Health in Vietnam and the Lang Son laboratory is authorized to provide HIV testing according to this protocol by the Ministry of Health.Data analysis ::: MethodsData were entered and data sets were prepared in EpiInfo, version 6.04 by staff of the Guangxi Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and the National AIDS Standing Bureau of Vietnam (which has since been merged into the General Department of Preventive Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control of the Ministry of Health). The data were analyzed at Beth Israel Medical Center and Abt Associates Inc. using the Statistical Analysis System, Version 8.2 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). Chi square tests were used to assess bivariate relationships among categorical variables. Multi-collinearity problems precluded multivariate analyses.Ethical review ::: MethodsThe study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the following institutions: Guangxi Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the National AIDS Standing Bureau of Vietnam, Abt Associates Inc., and Beth Israel Medical Center.ResultsTable 1 shows selected demographic characteristics of the IDU subjects recruited in China and Vietnam. In both provinces, the subjects were primarily young males who had never been married. Although there are known to be female IDUs on both sides of the border, the project has had difficulty inducing women to participate in the interventions and in recruiting them for the surveys. Over two-thirds of the subjects in China and one-half in Vietnam belonged to ethnic minority groups (primarily Zhuang in China and Tay and Nung in Vietnam). The ethnic minority subjects tended to live closer to the border. Table 2 and 3 shows the percentages of ethnic minority subjects in the different sites by distance to the border (in kilometers).ResultsFigure 2 shows the relationship between mean number of years injecting drugs and the site's distance from the border. There is a general gradient of decreasing mean years of drug injecting running from the site farthest from the border on the Vietnamese side (Lang Son City) to the site farthest from the border on the Chinese side (Ning Ming City). This gradient was statistically significant, p = -0.002. The estimated slope was -0.02, so the average number of years of injection use decreased by about a week (0.02 of a year) for each kilometer in the Chinese direction. This was based on a weighted linear regression model fitted to the mean number of years used in a site and distance to the border of the site. The weights were based on the sample size at each site.ResultsFigure 3 shows the HIV prevalence by distance to the border for the sites in Vietnam and China for the baseline data. There is a strong gradient of decreasing prevalence from the largest Vietnamese site and the one farthest from the border (Lang Son City) to the largest Chinese site and the one farthest from the border (Ning Ming City). Only one site- (Tan Thanh in Vietnam) does not fall along this gradient. Overall baseline seroprevalence among IDUs was 46% in Lang Son and in 17% Ning Ming. This gradient was statistically significant, p < 0.001. The estimated odds ratio was 0.97, so the odds of an individual being HIV positive decreased by 2–3% for each kilometer in the Chinese direction. This relationship between the proportion of subjects in a site testing positive and distance to the border was modeled using logistic regression.ResultsTable 2 shows factors related to crossing the border (in the 6 months prior to the interview) among the subjects in Vietnam and China. Overall, 10.6% of subjects in China and 24.5% of subjects in Vietnam reported having crossed the border in the six months prior to the interview. Being a member of an ethnic minority group and living closer to the border were strongly related to crossing the border in both countries. In Vietnam, being HIV seropositive was negatively related to crossing the border, while in China being HIV seropositive was positively related to crossing the border (although this relationship did not reach statistical significance, p = .12). Being a member of an ethnic minority group was related to being HIV seropostive in China (19% HIV seropositive among ethnic minority subjects versus 10% seropositive among ethnic majority subjects, (p < 0.05). Ethnicity was not related to HIV status in among the Vietnamese subjects.DiscussionIn this report, we present data on injecting drug use and HIV infection among IDUs in Lang Son province, Vietnam and Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China from a baseline survey conducted before implementation of a peer-based cross-border HIV prevention intervention.DiscussionSeveral limitations should be noted. First, we were working with cross-sectional data, where longitudinal data from the initial spread of injecting drug use in the area would have certainly been preferable. Second, there are measurement and sample size limitations. It would have been helpful to have a measure of ease of travel to the border rather than simple physical distance to the border. Also it would have been helpful to have sufficiently large sample sizes so that the relationship between being a member of an ethnic minority group and being HIV seropositive could be examined within individual geographic sites. Despite these limitations, there are very clear patterns in the data.DiscussionThere are similar gradients for mean length of injecting history and baseline HIV prevalence running in descending order from the Vietnamese site farthest from the border to the Chinese site farthest from the border. These patterns are consistent with the theory that both the practice of drug injection and the prevalence of HIV infection among IDUs spread from Northern Vietnam to Southern China along a major heroin trans-shipment route [5]. The patterns in our data suggest that, in some circumstances, it may be possible to reconstruct histories of the diffusion of injecting drug use and HIV among IDUs using cross-sectional data.DiscussionThere is clearly a potential for further cross-border transmission of HIV in both directions. Our discussions with the peer educators in the cross-border HIV prevention project suggest three primary reasons for these IDUs crossing the border: 1. Obtaining higher quality/lower priced drugs, 2. Avoiding police pressure on drug injectors, which can be unpredictably variable and involves large-scale periodic crackdowns, and 3. Personal factors, such as migratory employment, commerce, and family ties. It would appear to be very difficult to reduce these reasons for IDUs crossing the border.DiscussionBecause of the possibility of arrest, IDUs who cross the border are unlikely to carry needles and syringes with them, even if they are crossing the border at places without any supervision or inspection.DiscussionPrevention of risky injections among border crossing IDUs will require very good supplies of sterile injection equipment on both sides. If IDUs who crosses the border cannot readily access sterile injection equipment on both sides of the border, then their fellow IDUs will need to have sufficient supplies of sterile injection equipment for use by themselves and the IDUs who cross the border. This will require large-scale safer injection programs on both sides of the border.DiscussionThe majority of subjects in this study belong to ethnic minority groups, primarily Zhuang in China and Tay and Nung in Vietnam. Ethnic minority IDUs were also overrepresented among the border crossers. The issues of ethnic minority status, injecting drug use, and HIV infection deserve much more research and policy development. Ethnic minority IDUs are more likely to be infected with HIV in many places, from African-American and Latino/a IDUs in New York City [10] to Roma in Eastern Europe [11] to First Nations in Vancouver [12] to Vietnamese in Australia [13] to Manipuris in India [14]. As noted above, there was a strong relationship between ethnic minority status and HIV serpositivity in Ning Ming (OR = 5.08 (95% CI 1.41,18.26, p = .013) [15]. Social stigmatization of ethnic minority communities may make them more vulnerable to illicit drug use, including injecting drug use. Employment discrimination against ethnic minority communities may increase the extent to which drug distribution occurs in these communities, and to which drugs are transported by minority community members. Persons belonging to ethnic minority groups also may have important factors facilitating international travel, such as social support systems and persons that speak the same language on the other side of international borders.ConclusionThe data presented here illustrate many of the factors in the international diffusion of HIV among IDUs at modest geographic scale. (There is a total distance of 71 kilometers between the two most distant sites in the study). These include gradients of length of injecting drug use and HIV seroprevalence across the international border, border crossing by IDUs and its association with HIV infection for those crossing from China into Vietnam, overrepresentation of ethnic minority persons among the border crossers. Both injecting drug use and HIV among IDUs are already well established among IDUs on the Vietnamese side of the border and injecting drug use is well established on the Chinese side of the border. HIV is present among IDUs on the Chinese side of the border, but at lower seroprevalence levels than in Lang Son.ConclusionThere are multiple reasons that people cross the border in this area, and it would not appear to be possible to stop IDUs from crossing the border or from injecting drugs across the border. Thus, HIV prevention goals must include increasing the safety of injections among border crossers (as well as reducing risk behavior among the IDUs who do not cross the border). This will require coordinated HIV prevention that increases the likelihood that IDUs will inject safely on both sides of the border. Such a program has been implemented in Lang Son and Guangxi provinces. It includes peer outreach, increased access to sterile injection equipment through syringe distribution and exchange and a pharmacy voucher program. IDUs may exchange used injection equipment for new needles/syringes or for vouchers that can be redeemed at local pharmacies for needles/syringes, sterile water, and condoms. IDUs may also directly receive new needles/syringes or pharmacy vouchers even if they do not return used equipment. The program also includes large-scale collection and safe disposal of used needles/syringes, general community education about drugs and HIV, and social support for people living with HIV or AIDS [7].ConclusionReducing the international transmission of HIV among injecting drug users will require programs at the global, regional, national, and ""local cross-border"" levels. The local cross border programs will need to be coordinated on both sides of the border and on a sufficient scale that IDUs who cross the border will be able to readily obtain clean injection equipment on the other side of the border. The cross-border HIV prevention project currently being implemented in Lang Son Province and Ning Ming County, Guangxi offers an example of how such a coordinated approach can be implemented. Evaluation data being collected in Lang Son and Ning Ming will be used to gauge the effectiveness of the interventions.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsTH conceived of the study, the study design and coordination and assisted in the drafting of the manuscript.

Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease that was first reported in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002. The disease rapidly spread to at least 30 countries within months of its first appearance, and concerted worldwide efforts led to the identification of the etiological agent as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel member of the family Coronaviridae [1]. Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV [2,3] confirmed that this pathogen is not closely related to any of the previously established coronavirus groups. Budding of the SARS-CoV occurs in the Golgi apparatus [4] and results in the incorporation of the envelope spike glycoprotein into the virion. The spike glycoprotein is a type I membrane protein that facilitates viral attachment to the cellular receptor and initiation of infection, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV [5]. We have recently shown that the processing of the spike protein was effected by furin-like convertases and that inhibition of this cleavage by a specific inhibitor abrogated cytopathicity and significantly reduced the virus titer of SARS-CoV [6].BackgroundDue to the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the potential for rapid spread of the disease, and the absence of proven effective and safe in vivo inhibitors of the virus, it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections. Many novel therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in laboratory studies of SARS-CoV: notable among these approaches are those using siRNA [7], passive antibody transfer [8], DNA vaccination [9], vaccinia or parainfluenza virus expressing the spike protein [10,11], interferons [12,13], and monoclonal antibody to the S1-subunit of the spike glycoprotein that blocks receptor binding [14]. In this report, we describe the identification of chloroquine as an effective pre- and post-infection antiviral agent for SARS-CoV. Chloroquine, a 9-aminoquinoline that was identified in 1934, is a weak base that increases the pH of acidic vesicles. When added extracellularly, the non-protonated portion of chloroquine enters the cell, where it becomes protonated and concentrated in acidic, low-pH organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. Chloroquine can affect virus infection in many ways, and the antiviral effect depends in part on the extent to which the virus utilizes endosomes for entry. Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15]. Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease.Preinfection chloroquine treatment renders Vero E6 cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection ::: ResultsIn order to investigate if chloroquine might prevent SARS-CoV infection, permissive Vero E6 cells [1] were pretreated with various concentrations of chloroquine (0.1–10 μM) for 20–24 h prior to virus infection. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV, and virus antigens were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods. Microscopic examination (Fig. 1A) of the control cells (untreated, infected) revealed extensive SARS-CoV-specific immunostaining of the monolayer. A dose-dependant decrease in virus antigen-positive cells was observed starting at 0.1 μM chloroquine, and concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection. For quantitative purposes, we counted the number of cells stained positive from three random locations on a slide. The average number of positively stained control cells was scored as 100% and was compared with the number of positive cells observed under various chloroquine concentrations (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with 0.1, 1, and 10 μM chloroquine reduced infectivity by 28%, 53%, and 100%, respectively. Reproducible results were obtained from three independent experiments. These data demonstrated that pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with chloroquine rendered these cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection.Postinfection chloroquine treatment is effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV infection ::: ResultsIn order to investigate the antiviral properties of chloroquine on SARS-CoV after the initiation of infection, Vero E6 cells were infected with the virus and fresh medium supplemented with various concentrations of chloroquine was added immediately after virus adsorption. Infected cells were incubated for an additional 16–18 h, after which the presence of virus antigens was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. When chloroquine was added after the initiation of infection, there was a dramatic dose-dependant decrease in the number of virus antigen-positive cells (Fig. 2A). As little as 0.1–1 μM chloroquine reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90–94% inhibition was observed with 33–100 μM concentrations (Fig. 2B). At concentrations of chloroquine in excess of 1 μM, only a small number of individual cells were initially infected, and the spread of the infection to adjacent cells was all but eliminated. A half-maximal inhibitory effect was estimated to occur at 4.4 ± 1.0 μM chloroquine (Fig. 2C). These data clearly show that addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV if the drug is added immediately following virus adsorption.Postinfection chloroquine treatment is effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV infection ::: ResultsElectron microscopic analysis indicated the appearance of significant amounts of extracellular virus particles 5–6 h after infection [16]. Since we observed antiviral effects by chloroquine immediately after virus adsorption, we further extended the analysis by adding chloroquine 3 and 5 h after virus adsorption and examined for the presence of virus antigens after 20 h. We found that chloroquine was still significantly effective even when added 5 h after infection (Fig. 3); however, to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after adsorption.Ammonium chloride inhibits SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells ::: ResultsSince chloroquine inhibited SARS-CoV infection when added before or after infection, we hypothesized that another common lysosomotropic agent, NH4Cl, might also function in a similar manner. Ammonium chloride has been widely used in studies addressing endosome-mediated virus entry. Coincidently, NH4Cl was recently shown to reduce the transduction of pseudotype viruses decorated with SARS-CoV spike protein [17,18]. In an attempt to examine if NH4Cl functions similarly to chloroquine, we performed infection analyses in Vero E6 cells before (Fig. 4A) and after (Fig. 4B) they were treated with various concentrations of NH4Cl. In both cases, we observed a 93–99% inhibition with NH4Cl at ≥ 5 mM. These data indicated that NH4Cl (≥ 5 mM) and chloroquine (≥ 10 μM) are very effective in reducing SARS-CoV infection. These results suggest that effects of chloroquine and NH4Cl in controlling SARS CoV infection and spread might be mediated by similar mechanism(s).Effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on cell surface expression of ACE2 ::: ResultsWe performed additional experiments to elucidate the mechanism of SARS-CoV inhibition by chloroquine and NH4Cl. Since intra-vesicular acidic pH regulates cellular functions, including N-glycosylation trimming, cellular trafficking, and various enzymatic activities, it was of interest to characterize the effect of both drugs on the processing, glycosylation, and cellular sorting of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor, ACE2. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on Vero E6 cells that were either untreated or treated with highly effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine or NH4Cl. The results revealed that neither drug caused a significant change in the levels of cell-surface ACE2, indicating that the observed inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV infection are not due to the lack of available cell-surface ACE2 (Fig. 5A). We next analyzed the molecular forms of endogenous ACE2 in untreated Vero E6 cells and in cells that were pre-incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of either NH4Cl (2.5–10 mM) or chloroquine (1 and 10 μM) and labeled with 35S-(Met) for 3 h in the presence or absence of the drugs (Fig. 5B and 5C). Under normal conditions, we observed two immunoreactive ACE2 forms, migrating at ~105 and ~113 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5B, lane 1). The ~105-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H sensitive, suggesting that it represents the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized form, whereas the ~113-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H resistant and represents the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 [19]. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by displacing the immunoreactive protein bands with excess cold-soluble human recombinant ACE2 (+ rhACE2; Fig. 5B, lane 2). When we analyzed ACE2 forms in the presence of NH4Cl, a clear stepwise increase in the migration of the ~113-kDa protein was observed with increasing concentrations of NH4Cl, with a maximal effect observed at 10 mM NH4Cl, resulting in only the ER form of ACE2 being visible on the gel (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3–5). This suggested that the trimming and/or terminal modifications of the N-glycosylated chains of ACE2 were affected by NH4Cl treatment. In addition, at 10 mM NH4Cl, the ER form of ACE2 migrated with slightly faster mobility, indicating that NH4Cl at that concentration might also affect core glycosylation. We also examined the terminal glycosylation status of ACE2 when the cells were treated with chloroquine (Fig. 5C). Similar to NH4Cl, a stepwise increase in the electrophoretic mobility of ACE2 was observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine. At 25 μM chloroquine, the faster electrophoretic mobility of the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 was clearly evident. On the basis of the flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation analyses, it can be inferred that NH4Cl and chloroquine both impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2, while NH4Cl resulted in a more dramatic effect. Although ACE2 is expressed in similar quantities at the cell surface, the variations in its glycosylation status might render the ACE2-SARS-CoV interaction less efficient and inhibit virus entry when the cells are treated with NH4Cl and chloroquine.Effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on cell surface expression of ACE2 ::: ResultsTo confirm that ACE2 undergoes terminal sugar modifications and that the terminal glycosylation is affected by NH4Cl or chloroquine treatment, we performed immunopreipitation of 35S-labeled ACE2 and subjected the immunoprecipitates to neuraminidase digestion. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE (Fig 5D). It is evident from the slightly faster mobility of the Golgi form of ACE2 after neuraminidase treatment (Fig 5D, compare lanes 1 and 2), that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation; however, the ER form of ACE2 was not affected by neuraminidase. Cells treated with 10 μM chloroquine did not result in a significant shift; whereas 25 μM chloroquine caused the Golgi form of ACE2 to resolve similar to the neuraminidase-treated ACE2 (Fig 5D, compare lanes 5 and 6). These data provide evidence that ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation and that chloroquine at anti-SARS-CoV concentrations abrogates the process.Effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on the biosynthesis and processing of SARS-CoV spike protein ::: ResultsWe next addressed whether the lysosomotropic drugs (NH4Cl and chloroquine) affect the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and/or trafficking of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. For this purpose, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 18 h. Chloroquine or ammonium chloride was added to these cells during while they were being starved (1 h), labeled (30 min) or chased (3 h). The cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the SARS-specific polyclonal antibody (HMAF). The 30-min pulse results indicated that pro-spike (proS) was synthesized as a ~190-kDa precursor (proS-ER) and processed into ~125-, ~105-, and ~80-kDa proteins (Fig. 6A, lane 2), a result identical to that in our previous analysis [6]. Except for the 100 μM chloroquine (Fig. 6A, lane 3), there was no significant difference in the biosynthesis or processing of the virus spike protein in untreated or chloroquine-treated cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 4–6). It should be noted that chloroquine at 100 μM resulted in an overall decrease in biosynthesis and in the levels of processed virus glycoprotein. In view of the lack of reduction in the biosynthesis and processing of the spike glycoprotein in the presence of chloroquine concentrations (10 and 50 μM) that caused large reductions in SARS-CoV replication and spread, we conclude that the antiviral effect is probably not due to alteration of virus glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing. Similar analyses were performed with NH4Cl, and the data suggested that the biosynthesis and processing of the spike protein were also not negatively affected by NH4Cl (Fig. 6A, lanes 7–12). Consistent with our previous analysis [6], we observed the presence of a larger protein, which is referred to here as oligomers. Recently, Song et al. [20] provided evidence that these are homotrimers of the SARS-CoV spike protein and were incorporated into the virions. Interestingly, the levels of the homotrimers in cells treated with 100 μM chloroquine and 40 and 20 mM NH4Cl (Fig. 6A, lanes 3, 9, and 10) were slightly lower than in control cells or cells treated with lower drug concentrations.Effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on the biosynthesis and processing of SARS-CoV spike protein ::: ResultsThe data obtained from a 30-min pulse followed by a 3-h chase (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 8) confirmed our earlier observation that the SARS-CoV spike protein precursor (proS-ER) acquires Golgi-specific modifications (proS-Golgi) resulting in a ~210-kDa protein [6]. Chloroquine at 10, 25, and 50 μM had no substantial negative impact on the appearance of the Golgi form (Fig. 6B, compare lane 2 to lanes 4–6). Only at 100 μM chloroquine was a reduction in the level of the Golgi-modified pro-spike observed (lane 3). On the other hand, NH4Cl abrogated the appearance of Golgi-modified forms at ≥10 mM (compare lane 8 with 9–11) and had a milder effect at 1 mM (lane 12). These data clearly demonstrate that the biosynthesis and proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV spike protein are not affected at chloroquine (25 and 50 μM) and NH4Cl (1 mM) doses that cause virus inhibitory effects. In addition, with 40, 20, and 10 mM NH4Cl, there was an increased accumulation of proS-ER with a concomitant decrease in the amount of oligomers (Fig. 6B, lanes 9–11). When we examined the homotrimers, we found that chloroquine at 100 μM and NH4Cl at 40 and 20 mM resulted in slightly faster mobility of the trimers (Fig. 6B, lanes 3, 9, and 10), but lower drug doses, which did exhibit significant antiviral effects, did not result in appreciable differences. These data suggest that the newly synthesized intracellular spike protein may not be a major target for chloroquine and NH4Cl antiviral action. The faster mobility of the trimer at certain higher concentration of the drugs might be due the effect of these drugs on the terminal glycosylation of the trimers.DiscussionWe have identified chloroquine as an effective antiviral agent for SARS-CoV in cell culture conditions, as evidenced by its inhibitory effect when the drug was added prior to infection or after the initiation and establishment of infection. The fact that chloroquine exerts an antiviral effect during pre- and post-infection conditions suggest that it is likely to have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages. Recently, Keyaerts et al. [21] reported the antiviral properties of chloroquine and identified that the drug affects SARS-CoV replication in cell culture, as evidenced by quantitative RT-PCR. Taken together with the findings of Keyaerts et al. [21], our analysis provides further evidence that chloroquine is effective against SARS-CoV Frankfurt and Urbani strains. We have provided evidence that chloroquine is effective in preventing SARS-CoV infection in cell culture if the drug is added to the cells 24 h prior to infection. In addition, chloroquine was significantly effective even when the drug was added 3–5 h after infection, suggesting an antiviral effect even after the establishment of infection. Since similar results were obtained by NH4Cl treatment of Vero E6 cells, the underlying mechanism(s) of action of these drugs might be similar.DiscussionApart from the probable role of chloroquine on SARS-CoV replication, the mechanisms of action of chloroquine on SARS-CoV are not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested the elevation of pH as a mechanism by which chloroquine reduces the transduction of SARS-CoV pseudotype viruses [17,18]. We examined the effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on the SARS-CoV spike proteins and on its receptor, ACE2. Immunoprecipitation results of ACE2 clearly demonstrated that effective anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of chloroquine and NH4Cl also impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2. However, the flow cytometry data demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the cell surface expression of ACE2 in cells treated with chloroquine or NH4Cl. On the basis of these results, it is reasonable to suggest that the pre-treatment with NH4Cl or chloroquine has possibly resulted in the surface expression of the under-glycosylated ACE2. In the case of chloroquine treatment prior to infection, the impairment of terminal glycosylation of ACE2 may result in reduced binding affinities between ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike protein and negatively influence the initiation of SARS-CoV infection. Since the biosynthesis, processing, Golgi modification, and oligomerization of the newly synthesized spike protein were not appreciably affected by anti-SARS-CoV concentrations of either chloroquine or NH4Cl, we conclude that these events occur in the cell independent of the presence of the drugs. The potential contribution of these drugs in the elevation of endosomal pH and its impact on subsequent virus entry or exit could not be ruled out. A decrease in SARS-CoV pseudotype transduction in the presence of NH4Cl was observed and was attributed to the effect on intracellular pH [17,18]. When chloroquine or NH4Cl are added after infection, these agents can rapidly raise the pH and subvert on-going fusion events between virus and endosomes, thus inhibiting the infection.DiscussionIn addition, the mechanism of action of NH4Cl and chloroquine might depend on when they were added to the cells. When added after the initiation of infection, these drugs might affect the endosome-mediated fusion, subsequent virus replication, or assembly and release. Previous studies of chloroquine have demonstrated that it has multiple effects on mammalian cells in addition to the elevation of endosomal pH, including the prevention of terminal glycosyaltion of immunoglobulins [22]. When added to virus-infected cells, chloroquine inhibited later stages in vesicular stomatitis virus maturation by inhibiting the glycoprotein expression at the cell surface [23], and it inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 particles by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the glycoprotein [24,25]. On the basis of these properties, we suggest that the cell surface expression of under-glycosylated ACE2 and its poor affinity to SARS-CoV spike protein may be the primary mechanism by which infection is prevented by drug pretreatment of cells prior to infection. On the other hand, rapid elevation of endosomal pH and abrogation of virus-endosome fusion may be the primary mechanism by which virus infection is prevented under post-treatment conditions. More detailed SARS CoV spike-ACE2 binding assays in the presence or absence of chloroquine will be performed to confirm our findings. Our studies indicate that the impact of NH4Cl and chloroquine on the ACE2 and spike protein profiles are significantly different. NH4Cl exhibits a more pronounced effect than does chloroquine on terminal glycosylation, highlighting the novel intricate differences between chloroquine and ammonium chloride in affecting the protein transport or glycosylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and its receptor, ACE2, despite their well-established similar effects of endosomal pH elevation.DiscussionThe infectivity of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV are also affected by chloroquine, as exemplified by the human CoV-229E [15]. The inhibitory effects observed on SARS-CoV infectivity and cell spread occurred in the presence of 1–10 μM chloroquine, which are plasma concentrations achievable during the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria (varying from 1.6–12.5 μM) [26] and hence are well tolerated by patients. It recently was speculated that chloroquine might be effective against SARS and the authors suggested that this compound might block the production of TNFα, IL6, or IFNγ [15]. Our data provide evidence for the possibility of using the well-established drug chloroquine in the clinical management of SARS.ConclusionChloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases including malaria, amoebiosis and human immunodeficiency virus is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. The fact that the drug has significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either prior to or after infection suggests a possible prophylactic and therapeutic use.SARS-CoV infection, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation analyses ::: MethodsVero E6 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) were infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) medium with or without various concentrations of either chloroquine or NH4Cl (both from Sigma). Immunofluorescence staining was performed with SARS-CoV-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) [8] followed by anti-mouse fluorescein-coupled antibody.SARS-CoV infection, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation analyses ::: MethodsEighteen hours after infection, the virus-containing supernatants were removed, and the cells were pulsed with 35S-(Cys) for 30 min and chased for 3 h before lysis in RIPA buffer. Clarified cell lysates and media were incubated with HMAF, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 3–8% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen); proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, cells were chased for 3 h with isotope-free medium. Clarified cell supernatants were also immunoprecipitated with SARS-CoV-specific HMAF.ACE2 flow cytometry analysis and biosynthesis ::: MethodsVero E6 cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 10 μM chloroquine or 20 mM NH4Cl. To analyze the levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, cells were incubated on ice with 10 μg/mL affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems) and then incubated with FITC-labeled swine anti-goat IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories). Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For ACE2 biosynthesis studies, Vero E6 cells were pulsed with 250 μCi 35S-(Met) (Perkin Elmer) for 3 h with the indicated concentrations of chloroquine or NH4Cl and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D systems), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMV did all the experiments pertaining to SARS CoV infection and coordinated the drafting of the manuscript.

The SARS Coronavirus S Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain: Fine Mapping and Functional Characterization,"Viral envelope glycoproteins initiate entry of viruses into cells by binding to cell surface receptors followed by conformational changes leading to membrane fusion and delivery of the genome to the cytoplasm [1]. The spike (S) glycoproteins of coronaviruses are no exception and mediate binding to host cells followed by membrane fusion; they are major targets for neutralizing antibodies and form the characteristic corona of large, distinctive spikes in the viral envelopes [2,3]. Such 20 nm complex surface projections also surround the periphery of the SCV particles [4]. The level of overall sequence similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of the SCV S glycoprotein and the S glycoproteins of other coronaviruses is low (20–27% pairwise amino acid identity) except for some conserved sequences in the S2 subunit [5]. The low level of sequence similarity precludes definite conclusions about functional and structural similarity.BackgroundThe full-length SCV S glycoprotein and various soluble fragments have been recently cloned, expressed and characterized [6-11]. The S glycoprotein runs at about 170–200 kDa in SDS gels suggesting posttranslational modifications as predicted by previous computer analysis and observed for other coronaviruses [6,11]. S and its soluble ectodomain, Se, were not cleaved to any significant degree [6]. Because the S protein of coronaviruses is a class I fusion protein [12], this observation classifies the SCV S protein as an exception to the rule that class I fusion proteins are cleaved exposing an N-terminal fusogenic sequence (fusion peptide) although cleavage of S could enhance fusion [9].BackgroundBecause S is not cleaved, it is difficult to define the exact location of the boundary between S1 and S2; presumably it is somewhere between residues around 672 and 758 [6,7]. Fragments containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 17 to 537 and 272 to 537 but not 17 to 276 bound specifically to Vero E6 cells and purified soluble receptor (ACE2) molecules [6]. Together with data for inhibition of binding by antibodies, developed against peptides from S, these findings suggested that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537 [6]. Two other groups obtained similar results and found that independently folded fragments containing residues 318 to 510 [8] and 270 to 510 [10] can bind receptor molecules. Currently, these fragments are being further characterized to better understand the interactions of the virus with its receptor as well as their potential as inhibitors of the virus entry by blocking these interactions. Here, we present evidence that glycosylation of these and other fragments containing the S RBD does not affect to any measurable degree their binding to the receptor (ACE2), and analyze the S RBD-ACE2 interaction.A short RBD fragment containing only two potential glycosylation sites folds independently and binds ACE2 ::: ResultsWe and others have previously identified the RBD by using fragments containing three potential glycosylation sites – at residues 318, 330 and 357 [6,8,10]. To find the minimal number of potential glycosylation sites and shortest length required for expression and folding of S RBD fragments, we cloned in pSecTag 2B fragments with various number of potential glycosylation sites and length including S317–518, S319–518, S329–518, S364–537, S399–518, S317–493, and S329–458, where the numbers after S denote the amino acid residues confining the fragment. Note that these fragments were not constructed as fusion proteins with Fc as in a previous report [8]. This is why we also designed and tested several fragments with deleted portions of the RBD that have already been shown to be important for binding to ACE2 including regions between residues 327 and 490 [8]. The S317–518 and S319–518 fragments were secreted in the culture supernatant (Fig 1A), and bound to ACE2-expressing cells (Fig 1B) and purified ACE2 (Table 1 and data not shown). The difference in the molecular weights of the two fragments (about 3 kD) is much larger than the calculated weight due to the two additional amino acids contained in S317–518, and is likely due to glycosylation. Both fragments bound to ACE2 at comparable levels (Fig. 1B). The other fragments were not secreted (Fig. 1A) but could be detected by Western in cell lysates (data not shown). These results suggest that a short fragment (S319–518), which is not a fusion protein, with only two glycosylation sites can be independently folded and secreted in a soluble form, and can bind ACE2.The potential glycosylation sites in RBD fragments are functional and glycosylation does not affect binding to ACE2 ::: ResultsTo find whether the potential glycosylation sites in the RBD fragments are functional we constructed mutants, where the three residues N318, N330 and N357 in S317–319 were mutated individually from asparagine to alanine. As is shown in Fig. 2A all three mutants were expressed and ran on SDS-PAGE at molecular weights of about 3 kD smaller than the unmodified fragment. They all bound to ACE2 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with the shorter fragment (S319–518) where asparagines were also mutated to glutamines, which better mimic asparagines (Fig. 3). These results suggest that all glycosylation sites in the RBD are functional, and that the lack of glycosylation in any of the glycosylation sites does not interfere with binding to ACE2.Only one glycosylation site is required for secretion of functional RBD fragments ::: ResultsTo find the minimal number of functional glycosylation sites required for secretion of the RBD we generated double mutants of S319–518 where the asparagines N330 and N357 were mutated to either alanines (Ala 2) or glutamines (Gln 2). These mutants were not detected in the culture supernatants (Fig. 4A) and the culture supernatants did not exhibit any binding activity to ACE2 (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that at least one glycosylation site is required for secretion of functional RBD fragments.Identification of 11 RBD amino acid residue mutations that affect its binding to ACE2, and 20 – that do not ::: ResultsTo identify RBD amino acid residues that might affect binding to ACE2, we converted 32 residues in S319–518 to alanine, expressed the mutants and tested their binding to ACE2. Eleven mutants, K390, R426, D429, T431, D454, I455, N473, F483, Q492, Y494, and R495 exhibited decreased binding to ACE2 at comparable levels of expression (Table 1). Note that RBD fragment mutated at D454 or Y494 was expressed at somewhat lower levels but binding was much more significantly reduced. In addition, one of these mutations, D454, was previously shown to affect the RBD-ACE2 interaction [8]. The T431 mutation reduced binding but to lesser extent than the other mutations that decreased very significantly (more than 10-fold) the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The protein mutated at R441 expressed poorly and we were not able to assess its role in the RBD binding, although because of the similar levels of decrease in binding and expression, it is likely that this mutation does not affect binding. Interestingly, it appears that the D393 mutation enhanced binding – the mutated fragment expressed at low concentration but its binding equaled the binding of the non-mutated protein. The mutated residues that affect RBD binding include positively and negatively charged, polar and hydrophobic residues, indicating a role of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in the RBD-ACE2 interactions. These results also demonstrate that the mutations for the selected panel of residues that do affect binding are significantly (about 2-fold) more than those that do not, suggesting possible mechanisms of immune evasion.Analysis of the S RBD sequence and the role of critical residues in S RBD ::: ResultsIn order to further characterize the RBD and its interaction with ACE2 we analyzed the sequence and secondary structure, and how they relate to the mutations that affect binding to the receptor. A sequence-based secondary structure analysis of the S RBD predicted mostly β-sheets (data not shown), connected by loops or turns, where most of the residues affecting the RBD-ACE2 interactions are located. To find out additional residues that are not likely to affect binding significantly we aligned multiple RBD sequences of various non-redundant SCV strains. Figure 5A shows the identified 13 amino acid residues, which can be mutated without affecting the function of the virus to cause infection. Interestingly, one of these residues, R426, which decreases binding to ACE2 about 10-fold if mutated to A, is mutated to G in one of the strains. Four of the other 12 mutations (indicated with * in Table 1) do not affect binding to ACE2 when converted to A. To examine the extent of similarities of the SCV RBD sequence with related sequences of other coronaviruses from different organisms, which share only about 20–35% sequence identities, we performed multiple alignments using BLAST. Strikingly, six cysteine residues are conserved (Fig. 5B) indicating the possibility for up to three possible disulphide bridges within the S RBD that can help to keep the structural integrity of this domain. Most of the residues we found important for binding are highly variable except T431, Q492 and R495, which are highly conserved (Fig. 5B). The multiple sequence alignment score was then used to build a phylogram by using the ClustalW software. The results suggested that the SCV S RBD is much more distant than the respective regions of the other tested coronaviruses (Fig. 5C).Analysis of the S RBD sequence and the role of critical residues in S RBD ::: ResultsRecently, the crystal structure of S RBD-ACE2 complex was solved and the coordinates became available after the completion of this study, kindly provided by Stephen Harrison (Li, F, Li, W, Farzan, M, and Harrison, S. C., submitted). We have mapped the S RBD mutations on the surface of the crystal structure by using InsightII software. The Connolly molecular surface of the S RBD as viewed from the receptor ACE2 is shown in Fig. 6A. The S RBD is in yellow color in which the mutants that significantly affect the binding to ACE2 are shown in red and those that do not affect the binding are in cyan. The two glycosylation sites at 330 and 357 positions are colored in green. In the right panel the structure is rotated by 180° to show the opposite side of the RBD surface.Analysis of the S RBD sequence and the role of critical residues in S RBD ::: ResultsIn the structure of the S RBD-ACE2 complex two of the mutants with very significantly reduced binding to ACE2, R426A and N473A, make contacts with ACE2 residues and are completely exposed (Table 1). They are separated by residues whose mutations do not affect the S RBD binding to ACE2. Interestingly, six of the mutations we identified to reduce binding are buried but at close proximity to R426 as shown by the translucent surface highlighting in Fig. 6B indicating sensitivity of this area to mutations and likely involvement of other residues. Residues D454 and I455, whose mutation reduced binding to ACE2, do not make contacts with ACE2 and are located on the side opposing the side facing the receptor (right panel of Fig. 6); it is likely that the mutations decrease binding by inducing conformational changes. Other mutations including mutations of the two glycosylations sites on that side do not affect binding to ACE2 (right panels of Fig. 6). These results suggest the existence of two hot spots on the S RBD surface, R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute significant portion of the binding energy.DiscussionThe major results of this work are the demonstration of the functionality of the potential glycosylation sites of the S RBD and the requirement of at least one of them for its proper expression as well as the identification of two hot spots on the S RBD surface, R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute significant portion of the binding energy to ACE2. ACE2 was previously identified as a receptor for the SCV [7] and this finding was confirmed [6,13]. ACE2 binds with high (nM) affinity to S and is expected to induce conformational changes required for membrane fusion [6-8,14]. Its crystal structure was recently reported [15] and is in general agreement with two homology models previously developed [16,17]. It was proposed that the S binding domain on ACE2 involves residues on the ridges surrounding the enzymatic site [17]. Recently, several ACE2 regions and amino acid residues were identified as important for its binding to the S RBD [18].DiscussionCurrently, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the S RBD in free unbound form is unknown. We performed sequence analysis and developed a 3D model of a fragment containing the S RBD (the model will be described elsewhere). According to this model the S RBD like RBDs from other viruses contains predominantly β-sheets. Most of the residues affecting the ACE2 interactions are exposed on the surface of the beta sheets and inter-connecting loops. These predicted observations are consistent with the recently solved crystal structure of S RBD complexed with ACE2 (Li, F, Li, W, Farzan, M, and Harrison, S. C., submitted). The nature of the residues, which include charged, hydrophobic and polar residues indicated that all these types of interactions could be involved either directly or indirectly in the S RBD binding to ACE2. Notable are the complementarities in the charges of several residues in S, e.g. R426 and N473 with those of ACE2, e.g. E329 and Q24, respectively. One can reason that these residues might contribute significantly for the on rate constant and proper orientation of the two molecules in the complex, as well as to the low dissociation rate constant. We identified two hot spots, residues R426 and N473, which are likely to contribute to the bulk of the free energy of interaction. Further studies are required for the elucidation of the energy profile of the S RBD-ACE2 interaction.DiscussionWe found that not only glycosylation of the three sites in the previously described RBD-containing fragments is dispensable for expression (except one that can be any) but it also does not affect binding to ACE2. Indeed all glycosylation sites are localized at the N-terminal portion of the RBD and are relatively close to each other not only in the sequence (residues 318, 330 and 357) but also in the 3D space (Fig. 6). We constructed a fragment (319–518), which contains only two glycosylation sites and still binds with an affinity undistinguishable from the fragments containing three glycosylation sites. Further mutations of all combinations of these sites revealed that only one of them is required for expression but none of them for binding. Therefore the S RBD contacts ACE2 by an area lacking carbohydrates, which is in agreement with the recently solved crystal structure of the S RBD (Li, F, Li, W, Farzan, M, and Harrison, S. C., submitted).DiscussionThe entry of the SCV into cells can be inhibited by antibodies that bind the S glycoprotein and prevent its binding to ACE2. Such a monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits membrane fusion at nM concentrations was recently identified by screening phage display libraries [19]. This antibody competed with ACE2 for binding to the S glycoprotein suggesting that its mechanism of neutralization involves inhibition of the virus-receptor interaction. We have also identified several antibodies specific for the S RBD ([20] and Zhu and Dimitrov, in preparation). The mutants developed in this study could be useful for mapping the epitopes of the antibodies against the S RBD, most of which are likely to neutralize the virus by preventing binding to the receptor ACE2.DiscussionMost of the mutations (20) described in this study did not affect binding of the S RBD to ACE2. This finding suggests that the virus could easily mutate and escape antibodies that do not exhibit the same energy profile of binding to S as ACE2. However, further studies are required in the context of the whole oligomeric S protein to make more definite conclusions about possible mechanisms of immune evasion.DiscussionThe results reported in this study could have implications for understanding the mechanisms of SCV entry, and for development of entry inhibitors, vaccine immunogens, and research tools. Future studies particularly the solution of the crystal structure of the S protein in free unbound form, and in complex with ACE2, as well as measurements of the energy profiles of binding to ACE2 and antibodies, could elucidate detailed mechanisms of the S RBD function that may help in the further development of clinically useful inhibitors and vaccines.Plasmids and antibodies ::: MethodsPlasmid encoding the soluble form of ACE2, pCDNA3-ACE2-ecto, was kindly provided by M. Farzan from Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. VTF7.3 is a kind gift from C. Broder, USUHS, Bethesda, MD. Expression vectors pSecTag2 series were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California). The monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope antibodies (unconjugated and conjugated to HRP) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).Cloning of S fragments ::: MethodsUsing the previously described S756 [6] plasmid as template, fragments S364–537 (5'-GATCGGATCCTCAACCTTT AAGTGC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCC AGTAC CAGTGAG-3'), S317–518 (5'-GATCGGATCCCCTAATATTACAAAC-3' and 5'-G ATCGAATTCGGTCAGTGG-3'), S317–471 (5'-GATCGGATCC CCTAATATTAC AAAC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCGAGCAGGTGGG-3'), S329–518 (5'-GATCGGA TCCTTCCC TTCTGTC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCG GTCAGTGG-3'), S329–458 (5'-GATC GGATCCTTCCCTTCTGTC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCGCACATTAGA TATGTC-3'), S319–518 (5'-GATCGGATCCA TTACAAACTTGTGTCC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCG GTCAGTGG-3'), S399–518 (5'-GATCGGATCCCCAGG ACAA ACTGG-3' and 5'-GA TCGAAT TCGGTCAGTGG-3'), and S317–493 (5'-GATCG GATCCCCTAATATTACA AAC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCAAGG TTGGTAGCC-3') were PCR amplified using the primers mentioned within the parentheses. The PCR amplified fragments were then directionally cloned into expression vector pSecTag 2B using the restriction enzymes Bam HI and Eco RI. The various mutations on S317–518 and S319–518 were generated using the QuickChange® XL Site Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol.Protein expression ::: MethodsVarious plasmids were transfected into 293 cells using the Polyfect transfection kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Four hours after transfection, cells were infected with VTF7.3 recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the gene for the T7 polymerase. The soluble S fragments were obtained from the cell culture medium.Western blotting ::: MethodsLoading buffer and DTT (final concentration 50 mM) were added to either S proteins concentrated from the culture supernatant using Ni-NTA agarose beads or directly to the supernatant, boiled and run on an SDS-PAGE. The monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was diluted in TBST buffer and incubated with the membrane for 2 hours, washed and then incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP for 1 hour, washed four times, each time for 15 min, and then developed using the ECL reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).Cell binding assay ::: MethodsMedium containing soluble S fragments was collected and cleared by centrifugation. Vero E6 cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 0.5 ml of cleared medium containing soluble S fragments and 2 μg of anti-c-Myc epitope antibody conjugated with HRP at 4°C for two hours. Cells were then washed three times with ice cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were incubated with ABTS substrate from Roche (Indianapolis, IN) at RT for 10 min., the substrate was cleared by centrifugation, and OD405 was measured.ELISA ::: MethodsFor the detection of the S protein fragments, a sandwich ELISA was used in which the plate was coated with anti-His tag antibody. The S protein containing culture supernatants were added and detected with an anti-c-Myc epitope antibody. In the second ELISA, the S protein was bound to the C9-tagged ecto-domain of receptor ACE 2 that was captured on a plate coated with anti-C9 antibody (ID4). As in the previous ELISA, the S protein was detected with anti-c-myc epitope antibody. The second ELISA was used to score the binding of the various S protein fragments to the receptor ACE 2. In all experiments, the incubations with the c-myc epitope antibody were for 2 h at RT.Sequence analysis of S RBD ::: MethodsSequence similarity searches were performed using NCBI BLAST program [21] by selecting, separately, all non-redundant sequences (nr) and sequences derived from the 3-dimensional structure records from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The BLAST analysis against nr database showed 19 SARS CoV-related sequences from different clones with identities of 97–99% from the top of the list as well as 7 different coronaviruses from other organisms which share only 20–35% sequence identities at the bottom. These sequences were collected and aligned with the sequence of SARS RBD fragment using ClustalW program [22] with default parameters. The multiple alignment sequence table was prepared by choosing the aligned sequences with optimal gaps and then a phylogram tree was constructed based on that alignment scores for the 7 different coronaviruses along with S RBD. Further, the BLAST against PDB database retrieved 5 hits and 4 of them have longer stretch of amino acids (PDB codes: 1KS5, 1K0H, 1NKG and 1QR0), which have detectable sequence similarities with different regions of SARS RBD.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
E-Predict: a computational strategy for species identification based on observed DNA microarray hybridization patterns,"Metagenomics, an emerging field of biology, utilizes DNA sequence data to study unculturable microorganisms found in the natural environment. Metagenomic applications include studies of diversity and ecology in microbial communities, detection and identification of representative species in environmental and clinically relevant samples, and discovery of genes or organisms with novel or useful functional properties (for recent reviews, see [1-4]).BackgroundCommon to all of these applications is the task of identifying (and often quantifying the abundance of) individual genes, species, or even groups of species from the large and often complex sequence space being explored. In the most general approach, shotgun sequencing is used to both identify and quantify individual sequences in a sample of interest [5-8]. In a more targeted approach, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify a particular subset of sequences, which can then be cloned and analyzed. For example, 16S rRNA sequences are frequently used to identify bacterial and archaeal species [9-12]. Another approach is based on functional screening of shotgun expression libraries to identify DNA fragments that encode proteins with desirable activities [13-15].BackgroundDNA microarrays are also emerging as an important tool in metagenomics [2,16-18]. Particularly in applications concerned with real-time identification of known or related species, microarrays provide a practical high-throughput alternative to costly and time-consuming cloning and repetitive sequencing. For example, as previously reported, DNA microarrays have successfully been used to detect known viruses [19-22] and to discover a novel human viral pathogen [23]. Other metagenomic applications in which microarrays have great potential include monitoring food and water quality [24], tracking bioremediation progress [2,25], and assessment of biologic threat [26].BackgroundUse of DNA microarrays in metagenomics introduces a series of analytical challenges. First, the sequence space to explore may be very large, especially in the case of environmental samples. Given the technologic constraints on the total number of probes that can be placed on a microarray, improved algorithms are required for optimal probe selection to maximize coverage. Second, microarray data generated in metagenomic studies can be very complex. In the case of viral diagnostics, nucleic acid extracted from clinical specimens usually contains host and bacterial contaminants in addition to viral RNA and DNA. As a result, hybridization patterns are complicated by substantial amounts of noise introduced by specific and nonspecific cross-hybridization that cannot be anticipated or controlled. Third, multiple and potentially closely related species may be present in a single sample, resulting in complex or even overlapping hybridization patterns. Finally, a species identification strategy based on the use of experimentally derived patterns alone is not feasible, because such empirical controls can be obtained only for a limited number of species available as pure cultures or genomic clones. New analytical tools capable of overcoming these challenges are acutely needed.BackgroundWe have previously reported the development of a DNA microarray-based platform for viral detection and discovery [23] (NCBI GEO [27], accession GPL366). Briefly, the platform employs a spotted 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray containing approximately 11,000 oligonucleotides, which represent the most conserved sequences from 954 distinct viruses corresponding to every NCBI reference viral genome available at the time of design. Nucleic acids are extracted from a sample of interest, typically a clinical specimen, and are amplified and labeled using random-primed reverse transcription, second strand synthesis, and PCR. The labeled DNA is then hybridized to the microarray, and hybridization patterns are analyzed to identify particular viruses that are present in the sample.BackgroundHere we report a computational strategy, called E-Predict, for species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns (Figure 1a). Using this strategy, an observed pattern of intensities is compared with a set of theoretical hybridization energy profiles, representing species with known genomic sequence. We illustrate the use of E-Predict on data obtained with our viral detection microarray and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying viral species in a variety of clinical specimens. Based on these results, we argue that E-Predict is relevant for a broad range of microarray-based metagenomic applications.The E-Predict algorithm ::: ResultsTheoretical hybridization energy profiles were computed for every completely sequenced reference viral genome available in GenBank as of July 2004 (1,229 distinct viruses). This set of profiles included all viruses represented on the microarray and many viruses whose genomes became available after the array design had been completed. All microarray oligonucleotides expected to hybridize to a given viral genome were identified using nucleotide BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) alignment [28]. Free energy of hybridization (ΔG) was then computed for each alignment using the nearest neighbor method [29,30]. Oligonucleotides that failed to produce a BLAST alignment were assumed to have hybridization energies equal to zero. Thus, a given theoretical energy profile consists of the non-zero hybridization energies calculated for the subset of oligonucleotides producing a BLAST alignment to the corresponding genome. Collectively, the energy profiles of all the viruses constitute a sparsely populated energy matrix, in which each row corresponds to a viral species and each column corresponds to an oligonucleotide from the microarray (Figure 1b).The E-Predict algorithm ::: ResultsThe general E-Predict algorithm for interpreting observed hybridization patterns is shown in Figure 1b. A vector of oligonucleotide intensities is normalized and compared with every normalized profile in the energy matrix using a simple similarity metric, resulting in a vector of raw similarity scores. Each element in this vector denotes the similarity between the observed pattern and one of the predicted profiles for a species represented in the energy matrix. The statistical significance of the raw similarity scores is estimated using a set of experimentally obtained null probability distributions. Profiles associated with statistically significant similarity scores suggest the presence of the corresponding viral species in the sample.Normalization and similarity metric choice ::: ResultsIn order to optimize the ability of E-Predict to discriminate between true positive and true negative predictions, we first evaluated the performance of several commonly used normalizations and similarity metrics. For this purpose we constructed a training dataset of 32 microarrays obtained from samples known to be infected by specific viruses. Fifteen microarrays represented independent hybridizations of RNA extracted from HeLa cells - a human cell line that is permanently infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18. The remaining microarrays were obtained from 17 independent clinical specimens from children with respiratory tract infections. Ten specimens contained respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seven contained influenza A virus (FluA), as determined by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test.Normalization and similarity metric choice ::: ResultsIntensity and energy vectors were independently normalized using sum, quadratic, unit-vector, or no normalization (Table 1). Similarity scores between the vectors were computed using dot product, Pearson correlation, uncentered Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, or similarity based on Euclidean distance (Table 2). All nonequivalent combinations of intensity vector normalization, energy vector normalization, and similarity metrics were evaluated. For each combination, similarity scores were obtained by comparing every microarray in the training dataset with every virus profile in the energy matrix. The performance of each combination was then evaluated by calculating the separation between the score obtained for the correct (match) virus profile and the best scoring nonmatch profile from either the same or a different virus family (Figure 2a and Figure 2b, respectively). We defined separation as the difference between the similarity scores of a match and the appropriate nonmatch profiles, divided by the range of all similarity scores on a given microarray. Using this statistic, a value of one corresponds to the best possible separation, a value of zero corresponds to no separation, and negative values represent cases in which a match profile is assigned a score lower than a nonmatch profile.Normalization and similarity metric choice ::: ResultsWith the exception of Spearman rank correlation, all considered metrics assigned the highest similarity scores to the match profiles on all 32 microarrays, independent of normalization choice. Not surprisingly, separation between interfamily profiles was greater than that between intrafamily profiles. In addition, changes in normalization and similarity metric had greater impact on intrafamily than on interfamily separation. The best overall separation was determined by calculating the product of the means of the intrafamily and interfamily separations divided by the corresponding standard deviations. Sum normalization of the intensity vectors, quadratic normalization of the energy vectors, and uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric achieved the highest overall separation, producing a mean intrafamily separation of 0.69 (standard deviation 0.17) and a mean interfamily separation of 0.93 (standard deviation 0.08). Therefore, we settled on this combination of normalization and similarity metric parameters as our method of choice.Significance estimation ::: ResultsRaw similarity scores, as described above, provide an effective means of ranking viral energy profiles based on similarity to an observed hybridization pattern. However, such ranking provides no explicit information regarding the likelihood that viruses corresponding to the best scoring profiles are actually present in a sample under investigation. For example, two profiles may have identical high scores, but one of the scores may reflect a true positive whereas the other may be the result of over-representation of cross-hybridizing oligonucleotides in a profile.Significance estimation ::: ResultsTo facilitate the interpretation of individual raw similarity scores, we sought to develop a test of their statistical significance. For this purpose, we obtained empirical distributions of the scores for every virus profile in the energy matrix. The distributions were based on 1,009 independent microarray experiments collected from a wide range of clinical and nonclinical samples representing different tissues, cell types, and nucleic acid complexities. Given such sample diversity, we assumed that any given virus was present in only a small fraction of all samples. Therefore, the empirical distributions are essentially distributions of true negative scores. The loge-transformed similarity scores were approximately normally distributed. Outliers on the right tails of the distributions, assumed to be true positives, were removed (see Materials and methods, below), and parameters of the null distributions were estimated as the mean and standard deviation of the remaining observations. These parameters were used to calculate the probability associated with any observed similarity score. Probabilities obtained this way should be interpreted as one-tail P values for the null hypothesis, that the virus represented by the profile is not present in the sample.Significance estimation ::: ResultsAs shown in Figure 3, the most significant similarity scores for all 32 microarrays in the training dataset were correctly matched to the virus known to be present in the input sample: HPV18 for HeLa samples, RSV for RSV-positive samples, and FluA for FluA-positive samples. Corresponding P values ranged between 8.7 × 10-3 and 7.7 × 10-7 (median 2.1 × 10-5), between 4.0 × 10-4 and 1.4 × 10-8 (median 5.1 × 10-8), and between 1.8 × 10-6 and 1.4 × 10-7 (median 4.7 × 10-7), respectively (Figure 3; red circles). Energy profiles of unrelated viruses from six representative families (black circles) as well as profiles of divergent members belonging to the same families as the match viruses (blue circles) had similarity scores of essentially background significance (P values > 0.14). Even P values of the most closely related intrafamily virus profiles (purple circles) were separated from those of the match viruses by more than 1.1 (HPV45), 2.1 (human metapneumovirus), and 3.4 (influenza B virus) logs. Although the P values obtained for these profiles are more significant than background, their similarity scores are entirely based on oligonucleotides that also belong to the match virus profiles. P values resulting from such profile overlaps can be easily recognized and masked if desired (see Example 3, below).Example 1 ::: Examples ::: ResultsIn this example, E-predict was used to interpret a hybridization pattern complicated by a low signal-to-noise ratio (Tables 3 and 4). The microarray result was obtained as part of our ongoing study of viral agents associated with acute hepatitis. Total nucleic acid from a serum sample was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the microarray using our standard protocol (see Materials and methods, below). Despite the fact that very few oligonucleotides had intensity higher than background (Table 4), E-Predict assigned highly significant scores to hepatitis B virus (P = 0.002) and several closely related hepadnaviruses (Table 3). Specifically, no hepadnavirus oligonucleotide had intensity greater than 500 (for reference, background intensities are around 100, and the possible range is between 0 and 65,536). PCR with hepatitis B specific primers confirmed the presence of the virus in the sample. Complete E-Predict output for this example is available as Additional data file 1. The microarray data have been submitted to the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GSE2228).Example 2 ::: Examples ::: ResultsIn this example, E-Predict was used to identify the presence of two distinct viral species in the same sample (Table 5). The microarray result was obtained from a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample, which was collected as part of our ongoing investigation of childhood respiratory tract infections. On this microarray, E-Predict assigned highest significance to two unrelated viruses, namely FluA (P < 10-6) and RSV (P = 0.008), suggesting a double infection. The sample was independently confirmed to contain FluA and RSV, by DFA and specific PCR, respectively. Complete E-Predict output for this example is available as Additional data file 2. The microarray data have been submitted to the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GSE2228).Example 3 ::: Examples ::: ResultsThis example illustrates the ability of E-Predict to identify a virus that was not included in the microarray design. Table 6 shows E-Predict results for a microarray used to identify a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)) during the 2003 outbreak of SARS, as reported previously [23,31]. Because our microarray was designed before 2003, it did not contain oligonucleotides derived from the SARS CoV genome. However, after the entire genome sequence of the virus became available [32], its theoretical energy profile was added to the E-Predict energy matrix. Reanalysis of the original SARS microarray data (NCBI GEO [27], accession GSM8528) using E-Predict revealed that the SARS CoV energy profile attained the highest similarity score and a highly significant P value (P = 1 × 10-6), despite the fact that the microarray, and therefore the profile, did not contain any oligonucleotides derived from the SARS CoV genome.Example 3 ::: Examples ::: ResultsIn addition to the SARS CoV prediction mentioned above, several astrovirus and picornavirus profiles had similarity scores with significant P values. However, these predictions were based on oligonucleotides corresponding to a conserved 3'-untranslated region shared by these viruses with the SARS CoV [23,33]. To identify incorrect predictions, such as these, resulting from partial profile overlaps with a match virus, we implemented an iterative version of E-Predict in which oligonucleotide intensities corresponding to the top scoring profile from one iteration are set to zero before running the next iteration. As a consequence, misleading predictions resulting from oligonucleotides shared with the top scoring profile fail to attain significant similarity scores in subsequent iterations. Conversely, only those predictions that are based on alternative oligonucleotides, namely predictions representing distinct species, remain. When iterative E-Predict was used on the SARS microarray, no astrovirus or picornavirus profile attained a statistically significant score (P > 0.04) in the second iteration, effectively removing these profiles from consideration. Complete E-Predict output for this example is available as Additional data file 3.Example 4 ::: Examples ::: ResultsThis example illustrates the use of E-Predict to discriminate between closely related viral species such as human rhinovirus (HRV) serotypes (Figure 4). Rhinoviruses are a genus in the picornavirus family, which also includes enterovirus, aphthovirus, cardiovirus, hepatovirus, and parechovirus genera. Partial sequence analysis [34-36] indicates that HRV serotypes can be divided into two major groups (A and B), with the exception of HRV87, which is more closely related to enteroviruses. Only two complete rhinovirus reference genomes are available, one for each group: HRV89 (group A) and HRV14 (group B). Energy profiles of both viruses are included in our energy profile matrix as well as profiles of several enteroviruses and other more distant members of the picornavirus family. RNA samples from cultures of 22 representative serotypes were individually hybridized to the microarray, and the results were analyzed by E-Predict. In the absence of complete genome sequence data and corresponding energy profiles for each of the 22 serotypes, the E-Predict results revealed whether a particular serotype was most similar to HRV89, HRV14, or one of the enterovirus genomes in the energy matrix. To further refine our analysis, we clustered the E-Predict similarity scores from all 22 microarrays across all picornavirus profiles (Figure 4a). The resulting cluster dendrogram of the serotypes exhibited striking similarity to a phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein (Figure 4b; also see Ledford and coworkers [34]). Serotypes 4, 26, 27, 70, and 83 were correctly grouped together on the basis of their similarity to the profile of HRV14 (group B); HRV87 formed a separate node, and the remaining serotypes were grouped together on the basis of their similarity to the profile of HRV89 (group A). Complete E-Predict output for this example is available as Additional data file 4. The microarray data have been submitted to the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GSE2228).DiscussionIdentifying individual species present in a complex environmental or clinical sample is an essential component of many current and proposed metagenomic applications. Given a foundation of genomic sequence information, DNA microarrays are a high-throughput and cost-effective methodology for detecting species in an unbiased and highly parallel manner. Metagenomic applications employing DNA microarrays include characterization of microbial communities from environmental samples such as soil and water [2,17], pathogen detection in clinical specimens and field isolates [16], monitoring of bacterial contamination of food and water [24], and detection of agents involved in potential cases of bioterrorism [26].DiscussionDespite the increasing use of DNA microarrays for species detection and identification, bioinformatics tools for interpreting hybridization patterns associated with complex clinical and environmental samples are lacking. Existing methods have utilized direct visual inspection of hybridizing oligonucleotides [23,37] or inspection following clustering [19,38]. Such methods are intractable for interpreting complex hybridization patterns, are time consuming, and suffer from user bias. Improved data interpretation tools must address several challenges. First, hybridization patterns may represent signal from dozens or even hundreds of species. Also, several closely related species may be present in a sample, giving rise to overlapping hybridization signals. A likely additional source of noise is unanticipated cross-hybridization, because many of the genomes present in a complex sample may be uncharacterized. Finally, obtaining pure samples of each possible species for the purpose of generating reference hybridization patterns is impractical or impossible in most cases.DiscussionWhen challenged with each of these problems, E-Predict proved to be a useful tool for interpreting hybridization patterns, correctly identifying viruses from diverse viral families present in a variety of clinical samples. In particular, E-Predict does not rely on the use of empirically generated reference hybridization patterns, because species identification is based instead on theoretical hybridization energy profiles. The energy profile matrix currently represents over 1,200 distinct viruses whose complete genomic sequences are known. As new viral genomes are sequenced, profiles are added to the matrix to broaden the range of species detection. For example, addition of the SARS CoV profile enabled accurate identification of the virus, even though no oligonucleotides derived from its genome were present on the microarray. Conversely, even when a perfectly matching profile is not available because of limited sequence coverage, E-Predict will identify the closest related species, as long as such species are represented on the microarray. This feature is particularly useful for detecting novel viruses as well as for discriminating between closely related viruses such as HRV serotypes. Naturally, maximum range and precision of detection is achieved through addition of new profiles and periodic microarray updates to include specific oligonucleotides from newly sequenced species.DiscussionE-Predict is also useful in overcoming problems related to nucleic acid complexity frequently encountered in clinical samples. For example, E-Predict correctly identified hepatitis B virus in a serum sample, despite the fact that the hybridization pattern was complicated by a low signal-to-noise ratio. In another example, E-Predict deconvoluted a complex hybridization pattern, correctly suggesting the presence of two viruses (FluA and RSV) in a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample. In yet another example, iterative application of E-Predict (see Materials and methods, below) to a hybridization pattern involving oligonucleotides derived from seemingly unrelated families (coronaviridae and astroviridae) premitted objective recognition that the pattern represented the presence of only one virus (SARS CoV).DiscussionUsing a training dataset of 32 microarrays derived from samples known to contain specific viral species, we identified a set of normalization and similarity metric parameters, which yielded the best discrimination between true positive and true negative species predictions. The combination of sum normalization of the intensity vectors, quadratic normalization of the energy vectors, and uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric was the optimal choice for our data. However, a different set of parameters may be required for applications that use a different nucleic acid amplification or detection strategy. An independent evaluation of potentially useful normalization and similarity metric parameters is therefore recommended for each specific application of the algorithm.DiscussionUsing our best combination of normalization and similarity metric parameters, we obtained a set of null distributions representing true negative scores. These distributions were based on over 1,000 independent hybridizations and the assumption that the majority of samples were negative for the presence of any given virus. Although valid for our data, this assumption will not hold for all cases. For example, in applications concerned with bacterial species detection, some species may be present in most or even all samples and others encountered only rarely. In this case, a more complicated model will be required to assess whether a specific distribution represents negative, positive, or both negative and positive scores. For example, in cases in which distributions appear bimodal, one mode may represent true negatives and the other true positives. In some cases, targeted experimental verification of a subset of representative scores may be necessary. If both positive and negative score distributions are available, then P values can be calculated for each distribution.DiscussionSeveral modifications to the algorithm may potentially result in improved prediction accuracy. First, in the current implementation oligonucleotides exhibiting nonspecific cross-hybridization are filtered and the remaining oligonucleotides are weighted equally. Because oligonucleotides exhibit a continuous range of nonspecific hybridization [20,30], a more sophisticated system of oligonucleotide weights may result in better performance. For example, using a procedure similar to that used to generate null distributions for the virus profile scores, empirical distributions can be obtained for individual oligonucleotide intensities, and individual oligonucleotide contributions may be weighted by the probabilities associated with the corresponding observed intensities. Such weighting may allow a more accurate assessment of significance.DiscussionSecond, no attempt was made to normalize nucleic acid abundances of individual species, which may vary widely in different samples depending on factors such as target-to-background ratio, number of species present, and efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Although individual nucleic acid abundances are difficult or impossible to estimate in most metagenomic applications, particularly before the corresponding species have been identified, in applications in which such estimates can be made, either experimentally or on theoretical grounds, the use of correction factors for calculating similarity scores or stratification of P value estimation may be needed. In addition, for highly abundant species, care should be taken to avoid saturation of individual oligonucleotides, because E-predict performance drops sharply after 20-25% of oligonucleotides in a given profile are saturated (data not shown).DiscussionThird, even though viral genomes were used as the basis for calculating energy profiles, the concept can easily be extended to other taxonomy nodes such as genera or families of viruses. This requires every sequence element to be classified at the appropriate node in the taxonomy hierarchy.DiscussionFinally, iterative use of E-Predict was intended for identification of multiple species that may be present in a sample. In this setting, it is important to distinguish between true predictions representing unique species present in the sample and misleading predictions arising from partially overlapping profiles. In each iteration it is assumed that the profile attaining the highest score corresponds to the species most likely to be among those present in the sample. When a novel species is present, this assumption may not hold because of limited oligonucleotide coverage. For instance, in the SARS CoV example, although SARS CoV attained a higher similarity score than mink astrovirus, the corresponding P values were comparable. However, even if mink astrovirus were the top prediction in the first iteration, SARS CoV would be the top prediction in the second iteration (P = 2 × 10-6; data not shown) and therefore would not be missed as a true positive. In our current studies P values in all iterations are estimated using the same set of null probability distributions. In addition, we use two iterations as our default, and essentially never need to run more than three iterations, because detection of more than two or three viruses is rare. However, iterative resolution of hundreds or thousands of species present in a sample may necessitate other normalization methods or adjustments to the null distributions for P value estimation. As an alternative, noniterative algorithms for analyzing overlapping profile signatures are also being explored.DiscussionIn conclusion, E-Predict is a novel computational approach for species identification, which is generally applicable to a wide range of metagenomic applications using DNA microarrays. In particular, as more sequencing efforts are being directed at natural microbial communities, DNA microarrays are bound to become a central tool for various downstream applications such as identification of microbial species or detection of genes and biochemical pathways in such communities. E-Predict addresses an acute need for computational tools that are capable of interpreting the highly complex microarray data obtained through such studies. E-Predict was developed for viral species identification and therefore has immediate implications for medical diagnostics and viral discovery. In addition, the concept of theoretical energy profiles can be extended to represent other microorganisms, particular genes, or biochemical pathways.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsAll patient samples were collected according to protocols approved by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsHeLa cells were grown to confluence in a T150 tissue culture flask in Dulbeco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells were harvested by adding 10 ml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. A quantity of HeLa total RNA (50 ng) was used for each amplification and hybridization.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsWith respect to pediatric respiratory samples, frozen nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were thawed and 200 μl aliquots were used to extract RNA using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA,USA) as follows. RLT buffer (750 μl) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample and mixed. Then, 1 ml of 100% ethanol was added, and the resulting mixture was applied to the columns in three 650 μl aliquots. The remaining steps were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, including on-column DNase digest. RNA was eluted from the columns with 30 μl nuclease-free water, and 9 μl was used for amplification and hybridization. For the hepatitis sample, frozen serum sample was thawed and a 150 μl aliquot was used to extract total nucleic acid using MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Systems, Alameda, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 μl nuclease-free water, and 9 μl was used for amplification and hybridization.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsFor HRV serotypes, frozen samples of low passage viral culture supernatants were thawed on ice and pre-filtered with a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Aliquots (200 μl) of the pre-filtered supernatants were treated with 600 U micrococcal nuclease (Fermentas USA, Hanover, MD, USA) in the presence of 10 mmol/l CaCl2 for 3 hours at 37°C. RNA was then extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Linearized polyacrylamide (20 μg; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used as the carrier during the 2-propanol precipitation. RNA was resuspended in 30 μl nuclease-free water, and 9 μl was used for amplification and hybridization.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsMicroarrays used in the study were essentially identical to those previously described [23]. Detailed description of the microarray platform, including oligonucleotide sequences, can be found in the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GPL 1834). Briefly, 70-mer oligonucleotides representing the most conserved viral genomic elements were selected as 70-mers having sequence similarity (determined by nucleotide alignment) to the highest number of viral genomes [19]. Oligonucleotides were resuspended in 3 × SSC (0.45 M sodium chloride, 0.045 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 50 μmol/l concentration and spotted onto poly-lysine coated glass slides [39]. Each spot on the microarray also contained a unique 'alien' sequence 70-mer (Spike70: 5'-ACC TCG CTA ACC TCT GTA TTG CTT GCC GGA CGC GAG ACA AAC CTG AAC ATT GAG AGT CAC CCT CGT TGT T-3'), spotted at a 1:50 ratio with the viral oligonucleotide to facilitate gridding of the microarrays (see below).Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsRNA extracted from the samples was amplified using a modified Round A-B random PCR method [40], as previously described (protocol S1 in [23]). Briefly, random-primed reverse transcription and second strand synthesis were carried out using primer A (5'-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TCN NNN NNN NN-3'). The resulting material was then amplified with 40 cycles of PCR using primer B (5'-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TC-3'). This was followed by an additional 20 cycles of PCR with primer B to incorporate aminoallyl-dUTP. The amplified material was then labeled with Cy5, and 0.1-1.0 pmol Probe70 (an oligonucleotide complementary to Spike70 containing five amino-modified bases for dye coupling: 5'-AAC AAC GAG GG[AmC6-dT] GAC TCT CAA [AmC6-dT]GT TCA GGT TTG TC[AmC6-dT] CGC GTC CGG CAA GCA A[AmC6-dT]A CAG AGG T[AmC6-dT]A GCG AGG T-3', Operon Biotechnologies, Huntsville, AL, USA) was labeled with Cy3. The Cy5 and Cy3 probes were pooled and hybridized to the microarray in 3 × SSC at 65°C overnight [39]. The Cy3 channel was used to facilitate gridding but otherwise was ignored in the data analysis. Microarrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA) and gridded using the bundled GenePix 3.0 software.Sample preparation and hybridization to microarrays ::: Materials and methodsMicroarray data have been submitted to the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GSE2228). The SARS microarray data are also available in NCBI GEO (accession GSM8528), as previously reported [23].Training dataset ::: Materials and methodsFifteen HeLa microarrays were chosen randomly from a set of 43 HeLa hybridizations having at least five papillomavirus oligonucleotides with sum-normalized intensities greater or equal to 0.005. Ten RSV microarrays were chosen randomly from a set of 22 clinical hybridizations having at least five paramyxovirus oligonucleotides with sum-normalized intensities greater than or equal to 0.005 and confirmed to be RSV-positive by DFA. Seven FluA microarrays were chosen from eight available clinical hybridizations having at least five orthomyxovirus oligonucleotides with sum-normalized intensities greater than or equal to 0.005 and confirmed to be FluA-positive by DFA. The eighth FluA microarray was excluded because it was also positive for RSV by visual inspection.Theoretical energy profiles ::: Materials and methodsThe energy profile matrix used in this study included all NCBI reference viral genomes (1,229) available as of July 2004 [41]. Nucleotide BLAST (blastall version 2.2.8 [42] with the default settings) was used to align microarray oligonucleotides with the viral genomes. Energies of hybridization were computed from the alignments using a program distributed with ArrayOligoSelector [30,43]. In cases in which an oligonucleotide had multiple alignments to the same genome, energy calculations were based on the highest scoring alignment. The energy profile matrix is available as Additional data file 5.Similarity scores ::: Materials and methodsControl oligonucleotides and oligonucleotides known to result in nonspecific hybridization were removed from consideration by setting their intensities and energies to zero. The list of these oligonucleotides (Additional data file 6) was obtained by including 129 oligonucleotides with unnormalized median intensity greater than 500, calculated from 1,009 independent hybridizations described below. The list also included 137 oligonucleotides obtained by clustering of distributions of sum-normalized intensity, based on the same set of 1,009 hybridizations, and visual identification of an outlier cluster with median sum-normalized intensities significantly higher than those observed for most oligonucleotides. Energy vectors were further filtered to exclude terms with energy predictions higher than -30 kcal/mol (again by setting their values to zero), because such predictions on our platform do not correspond to detectable array intensities [30]. A profile was considered only if it had at least three oligonucleotides with non-zero energy predictions. The resulting intensity and energy vectors were normalized using appropriate normalization methods (no normalization, sum, quadratic, and unit-vector). Similarity scores were computed using an appropriate similarity metric (dot product, Pearson correlation, uncentered Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, and similarity based on Euclidean distance).Probability estimation ::: Materials and methodsNull distributions of similarity scores were obtained using a set of 1,009 hybridizations, which included all hybridizations performed on our platform to date. Similarity scores were calculated as described above using uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric, and sum and quadratic normalizations for intensity and energy vectors, respectively. Scores were log-transformed. Right tail outliers corresponding to positive cases were excluded by iterative trimming of the top scores in 1% increments until the best normality fit was obtained, as judged by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test [44] (implemented in R [45]). Trimming was allowed to involve 0-25% of all scores. Over one-third of virus profiles required no trimming at all. Only a small number of profiles (34) required trimming beyond 10%, all of which corresponded to viruses frequently present in our samples. No profile required trimming of more than 17% of the scores. The resulting trimmed distributions were assumed to be normal, and their parameters were estimated as the mean and standard deviation of the included scores (Additional data file 7). Obtained parameters were used to estimate significance of individual scores as probabilities associated with observing values equal or greater than the scores. For this purpose, only profiles with at least three oligonucleotides with raw intensity greater than 100 (about two to four times background) were considered.Iterative E-Predict ::: Materials and methodsThe first iteration was carried out as described above. For each additional iteration, oligonucleotide intensities of the profile attaining the highest similarity score in the previous iteration were set to zero. The resulting intensity vector was normalized, and similarity scores and P values were calculated using the same normalization method, similarity metric, and null distributions as in the initial iteration.Clustering of human rhinovirus serotypes ::: Materials and methodsSimilarity scores were calculated as described above using uncentered Pearson correlation as the similarity metric, and sum and quadratic normalizations for intensity and energy vectors, respectively. Scores corresponding to picornavirus profiles were clustered using Cluster (version 2.0) [46,47] by hierarchical average linkage clustering with Pearson correlation as the similarity metric. Cluster images were obtained using Java TreeView (version 1.0.8) [48,49].Clustering of human rhinovirus serotypes ::: Materials and methodsThe phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein was constructed using data from the report by Jonassen and coworkers [34]. Sequence alignment of relevant serotypes and the resulting tree were obtained using ClustalX (version 1.81 for Windows [50,51]) with default settings.Polymerase chain reaction ::: Materials and methodsThe presence of hepatitis B virus in the hepatitis sample was confirmed using primers Hep_1F (5'-GAC TCG TGG TGG ACT TCT CTC AA-3') and Hep_4R (5'-GAA AGC CCT GCG AAC CAC TGA A-3') with amplified cDNA (Round B material; see [19] for amplification details) as the template. The presence of RSV in the FluA/RSV double-infected sample was confirmed by PCR using primers AU_041 (5'-GAT GAA AAA TTA AGT GAA ATA TTA GG-3') and AU_042 (5'-GTT CAC GTA TGT TTC CAT ATT TG-3') with cDNA (Round A material; see [19] for amplification details) as the template. In both cases, amplified PCR fragments were sequenced and had at least 99% nucleotide identity to the genomes of Hepatitis B virus (GenBank: NC_003977) and RSV (GenBank: NC_001803).E-Predict software ::: Materials and methodsThe E-Predict software is available for download by any interested party [52].Additional data filesThe following additional data are available with the online version of this paper: a text file of E-Predict output for the hepatitis example (example 1) (Additional data file 1); a text file of E-Predict output for the FluA/RSV double infection example (example 2) (Additional data file 2); a text file of E-Predict output for the SARS CoV example (example 3) (Additional data file 3); a text file of E-Predict output for the HRV serotypes example (example 4) (Additional data file 4); a tab delimited text file containing the energy profile matrix (Additional data file 5); a text file containing the list of nonspecific oligonucleotides ignored during E-Predict (Additional data file 6); a tab delimited text file containing the list of profile parameters used to estimate P values (Additional data file 7).

"Web GIS in practice III: creating a simple interactive map of England's Strategic Health Authorities using Google Maps API, Google Earth KML, and MSN Virtual Earth Map Control","The emergence of online consumer geoinformatics services ::: BackgroundMainstream Web search engines like Google and MSN Search have recently joined the geographic search bandwagon by releasing their own dedicated geographic interfaces, which run in standard Web browsers and also provide the general public with detailed satellite imagery/aerial photography map layers that were once only available to experts and select user communities.Google Maps and Google Earth ::: BackgroundGoogle released Google Maps ( – a localized UK version is also available; see, for example, Paddington Station, London, W2 1RH (Satellite): ). Google also released Google Earth , a fat client, standalone 3D (three-dimensional) desktop application that offers anyone with Internet access a planet's worth of imagery and other geographic information, allowing users to virtually sightsee exotic locales like Paris, France, and Maui (Hawaii), Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls in the USA, as well as viewing points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, schools, and more. Google Earth uses KML (Keyhole Markup Language) to store data [1].Google Maps and Google Earth ::: Background(It is noteworthy that NASA is also offering its own World Wind 3D application that lets users zoom from satellite altitude into any place on Earth.)Google Maps and Google Earth ::: BackgroundThanks to Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface – ), many third party applications and custom annotated maps have begun to appear [2]. Two good UK examples of such applications/custom annotated maps are the Health QOF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) Database map and London July 2005 Terrorist Attacks map . (But because Google Maps has its roots in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), users were also able to produce their own custom annotated Google maps, e.g., based on their own GPS (Global Positioning System) locational data, and to even tie in images and video to create interactive multimedia maps, well before the API was publicly documented [3].)Google Maps and Google Earth ::: BackgroundSmugmug Maps is another good example of a third-party Google Maps application in action. Smugmug, a photo hosting Web site, plots geocoded photographs to their actual locations on Google Maps (or Google Earth via a KML Google Earth feed: ), and allows location-based searching of photographs all over the world [4]. All smugmug RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds are now geo-enabled. If a photo has latitude, longitude, and altitude information (geographic metadata), it will show up in all feeds (see ).MSN Virtual Earth ::: BackgroundMicrosoft's response to Google Maps and Google Earth comes in the form of MSN Virtual Earth . A distinguishing feature of MSN Virtual Earth is its 'Locate Me' tool. Wired users can be located via their IP (Internet Protocol) address (this has been done for some time – see, for example, [5] and ). Wireless users can download a small application that does locating based on connection to a Wi-Fi access point. MSN Virtual Earth also features aerial oblique imagery (45 degree angle views or 'Eagle Eye Views') of major US metropolitan areas, provided by Pictometry International Corp. .MSN Virtual Earth ::: BackgroundAn MSN Virtual Earth Map Control/API (see and ) allows users to create their own custom online maps, and add their own data to MSN Virtual Earth.Yahoo! Maps ::: BackgroundCorresponding offerings from Yahoo! search engine have been modest by comparison, and include Yahoo! Maps and an associated API . As at the time of writing, the Yahoo! Maps service does not offer any satellite imagery/aerial photography, but this might change in the near future. The latest traffic status/incidents, as well as Wi-Fi hotspots can be visualized on Yahoo! Maps. Gottipati [6] provides a useful comparison of Google Maps API and Yahoo! Maps API.Web browser toolbars and other developments ::: BackgroundDedicated Web browser toolbars and extensions have also started to appear, e.g., MutantMaps , a Mozilla Firefox toolbar that allows navigation between five popular mapping sites (Google Maps, MSN Virtual Earth, MultiMap.co.uk, TerraServer.com and 192.com) while preserving user's longitude, latitude and zoom levels, and gMapIt, another Mozilla Firefox extension that allows users to find directions from Google Maps based on publicly listed US phone numbers .Web browser toolbars and other developments ::: BackgroundAlong the same vein, Amazon.com is now also providing A9 Block View , an online Yellow Pages/map service that offers US maps with street-level photos.ESRI's response ::: BackgroundSome commentators have recently wondered if users will soon eschew ArcGIS and ArcIMS (see and ) in favour of using Google Maps API and MSN Virtual Earth API to quickly create Web map applications. ESRI's response to all of the recent online consumer geoinformatics services described in this article was to announce (in 2005) its new partnership with National Geographic , GlobeXplorer , and TeleAtlas , plus Geospatial One Stop (GOS – ) and a few other partners like MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. – ), to upgrade the National Geographic MapMachine , a map service/online atlas that provides global map coverage for an extensive set of Earth science themes. MapMachine was first launched in November 1999, and is powered by ESRI's ArcWeb Services . The planned upgrade aims at bringing satellite imagery, aerial photos, and street-level data to MapMachine users. Users will be able to access the service through a new viewer that is aimed at a mass audience, and appears to be ESRI's direct response to Google Earth and Microsoft Virtual Earth. However, one important difference from those services is that the ArcGIS back end will also allow users of the new service to accomplish much more sophisticated tasks, such as service area analysis. The next generation of MapMachine will also provide a link to GOS data and metadata to help users discover information about their area of interest or study. MapMachine will include capabilities for 3D globe services, allowing GIS users to ""pull in"" their own map services to overlay onto a globe. Also planned is the addition of ESRI's MapStudio , an ArcWeb Services application used by many daily newspapers to create maps for printing, to enable users to create customised maps [7].Geocoding ::: MethodsThe programmable mapping interfaces provided by Google and MSN currently only accept longitude and latitude coordinates and do not provide their own geocoding services. Geocoding in our case was only based on the first part of SHA headquarters postcodes (e.g., PL12 for the South West Peninsula SHA, PL12 6LE), and was done using jibble.org list (see and download at ). The worldKit geocoder , a free online worldwide city geocoder, also uses jibble.org list for UK postcode geocoding.Google Maps API version of our SHA map ::: MethodsGuided by Google Maps API online documentation and Gottipati's online tutorial [6], we produced the Google Maps API version of our interactive SHA map. Google Maps API lets developers embed Google Maps in their own Web pages with JavaScript.Google Maps API version of our SHA map ::: MethodsWe had to first visit Google's sign-up page to get a free API key for the Web site where our maps were to be published. API keys are site-specific. We included all SHA coordinates and Internet addresses (for accessing further information) in a separate XML file. An XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) stylesheet is used to display SHA information taken from this XML document.Google Maps API version of our SHA map ::: MethodsWe used J. Shirley's GxMarker (see and download at ) instead of Google's GMarker to have marker tooltips (see inset in Figure 1).Google Maps API version of our SHA map ::: MethodsReaders wanting to further explore Google Maps API might be interested in Google Mapki Knowledge Base and list of developer tools . Google Mapki is a forum for sharing ideas, implementations, and help for the Google Maps API.Google Earth KML version of our SHA map ::: MethodsThe development of the Google Earth KML version of our maps was again guided by Google's online documentation available at . KML is an XML-based language. A new MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type (application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml kml) must be added to the server hosting the KML feed file to help client Web browsers like Internet Explorer associate the file with the appropriate client application (Google Earth) rather than opening it as a plain XML file.MSN Virtual Earth Map Control version of our SHA map ::: MethodsFinally, we created a third version of our maps using MSN Virtual Earth Map Control (download control at ), and guided by Part 1 of Roodyn's excellent tutorial available from Via Virtual Earth, Virtual Earth developer resource centre [8].MSN Virtual Earth Map Control version of our SHA map ::: MethodsIt should be noted that not all possible features of the programmable mapping interfaces provided by Google and MSN have been explored or demonstrated in our exercise and its outputs (see 'Results' below). For example, it is also possible to add VML (Vector Markup Language) polyline overlays to maps created using Google Maps API. Also, Part 2 of Roodyn's tutorial describes additional controls and widgets that can be used with MSN Virtual Earth Map Control [9].ResultsThe three interactive SHA map demonstrators we have created can be browsed online at (Google Maps API version – Figure 1), (Google Earth KML version – Figure 2), and (MSN Virtual Earth Map Control version – Figure 3). The maps have been successfully tested in both Internet Explorer 6-SP2 and Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6 Web browsers.The geodata-rich society ::: DiscussionESRI president Jack Dangermond recently predicted that the supply of satellite and aerial imagery will increase by two folds in the next few years. Availability will also increase greatly, via Web portals and online GIS services. This is all part of what Dangermond describes as a ""geodata-rich society"" that will have access to more geospatial information of all kinds, including, in addition to imagery, GPS/location data, geo-demographic data, and data from real-time monitoring [10]. The Internet is already the 'foundation medium' to access, link and use all these data.The geodata-rich society ::: DiscussionSatellite imagery and remote sensing are quickly entering the mainstream. Today, satellite imagery data are abundantly available from multiple sources, including companies such as Space Imaging , Orbimage , DigitalGlobe , GlobeXplorer , Spot Image , ImageSat International , and EarthSat ( – an MDA company), and are used in hundred of applications. But thanks to online consumer services like Terraserver , Google Earth, and Microsoft Virtual Earth (see 'Background' section above), satellite imagery has also been made familiar and accessible to millions of people.The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionThere is no doubt the different online consumer geoinformatics services that have been presented in the 'Background' section of this article, including the different geographic search interfaces from major Web search engine providers, have significantly contributed (in record time) to raising the general public interest in geography and satellite imagery. As millions of people start ""playing"" with these new online ""gadgets"" or ""toys"" from Google and Microsoft, many of them will soon start thinking about becoming active participants, sharing information and collaborating online (notions that have been rightly associated with the Web for quite a long time), rather than just being satisfied with a passive information consumer/viewer role. (The reader should note that it has been estimated that about 800 million persons are online today worldwide [11].)The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionHowever, although Google Maps API (and similar API offerings from other providers) enables users to deeply customize the standard provider's interface (Google Maps), and to create their own custom annotated maps (custom applications based on Google Maps), such APIs remain difficult for the non-expert, average user to exploit. This author expects the technology to further evolve to enable the average Web user to share geospatial information, to customize, annotate and publish his/her own online maps and related Web applications, and to collaborate with other users/online communities within an online customizable and collaborative mapping environment, all without the need for any prior programming knowledge or expertise. (Such user-friendly applications that do not require end-users to have any programming expertise to use them can also be built using the existing APIs.)The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionThe current 'wiki' concept is not far from this vision. A wiki (from Hawaiian wiki, to hurry, swift) is a collaborative Web site whose content can be edited by anyone who has access to it [12]. Perhaps the best example of a wiki in action today is 'Wikipedia – The Free Encyclopedia' (see the 'wiki' entry in Wikipedia at ). A related Web information sharing technology is the 'blog'. A blog (WeBLOG) is a Web site that contains dated entries in reverse chronological order (most recent first) about a particular topic. Functioning as an online journal, blogs can be written by one person or a group of contributors.

Wikis represent a promising principle that can significantly transform the Internet information age. Special conferences have been and are being organized to discuss this interesting Web phenomenon of wikis; for example, Wikimania 2005, the First International Wikimedia Conference, 4–8 August 2005, Frankfurt am Main, Germany , and the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)-sponsored WikiSym 2005, the 2005 International Symposium on Wikis, 17–18 October 2005, San Diego, California, USA .The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionAlong the same lines, it is not difficult to imagine the development in the very near future of 'geowikis', 'mapwikis', geo-enabled blogs, 'mapblogs' (imagine, for example, people with an Internet-connected, GPS-enabled mobile device wanting to blog their movements, and share their activity spaces and geo-referenced news with other online users for various purposes), and even geo-enabled, mappable Web/RSS feeds and map feeds (see the Smugmug KML photo feed example mentioned in the 'Background' section above). In fact some early geowiki examples have already found their way on the Web; see, for example, , , and also worldKit GeoWiki, a publicly editable map application (a simple online demo of worldKit GeoWiki to which anyone can add their own data is available at ).The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionAnother example is the Katrina Information Map , which was built using Google Maps [15]. Katrina Information Map was conceived for use by people affected by Hurricane Katrina (August 2005) and their relatives who have, or are trying to find, information about the status of specific locations affected by the storm and its aftermath. Users having information about the status of an area that is not yet on the map can easily contribute to the map by adding/appending their information to it. (Readers interested in Hurricane Katrina's online maps and imagery in general might also find the following two sites useful: , , and .)The wikification of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography: imaging and geospatial information for the wide masses ::: DiscussionThe possibilities and potentials are endless. This is what this author calls the ultimate ""wikification"" of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography. If the majestic Tate Museum in London is currently posting captions from its visitors next to its greatest works of art [16], why shouldn't online maps (even those from very reputable sources like the National Geographic Society) allow a similar approach?!Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionAs geospatial technology progresses and becomes more readily available to the wide masses around the world who are connected to the Internet, the interrelated issues of GIS and map data confidentiality/individual privacy, and even national security start to surface, calling for further examination of, and research into these delicate aspects of Internet GIS and Web maps [5,17-22].Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionFor example, in public health worldwide, any public identification of an individual's health status and residence, regardless of level of contagion or risk, is usually prohibited with very few exceptions, e.g., Megan's Law in the US, which allows the release of residential information on registered child sex offenders to the public by local government [17,23]. In fact, thanks to the latter law, we have a service like the Georgia Sex Offender Maps , which was built using Google Maps API. SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) mapping in Hong Kong in 2003 using disaggregate case data at individual building level in near real time was another noticeable exception to this well-established public health confidentiality rule, and also a unique and rare GIS opportunity that resulted in some very comprehensive public Internet mapping services [24].Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionIt is noteworthy that Google Maps API terms and conditions state, ""There are some uses of the API that we just don't want to see. For instance, we do not want to see maps that identify the places to buy illegal drugs in a city, or any similar illegal activity. We also want to respect people's privacy, so the API should not be used to identify private information about private individuals.""Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionOn another level, following the September 2001 terrorist events in the US, many federal and local spatial databases, e.g., ""critical infrastructure"" spatial data, were assessed by their holding agencies as a potential liability to national security and withdrawn from the Internet or public dissemination. The current concern is to find an appropriate balance between public access to spatial information and protection of information considered a priority for national security [17,23].Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionBut despite all these undeniable, legitimate and real concerns about Internet GIS and map data privacy and confidentiality, many of the doubts and misgivings that are raised concerning these aspects of Internet GIS seem to be ill founded, or at least exaggerated. Entchev [19] has wisely stated, ""Let us not cripple the GIS system to meet some vague privacy perceptions"".Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionAnother thorny Internet GIS issue that needs to be addressed is that of data and map copyrights. Conner [14] has rightly described online maps as a copyright minefield. Copyrighted geo-data and maps are usually more difficult and expensive to acquire and use.Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionBut as geo-data become more important in everything from blogs through mobile phones to finding lost people, free maps could make more and more of a difference [14]. However, someone needs to pay the bill for such ""free"" maps, and so finding sustainable commercial models for adoption by online geo-data and Web map providers is becoming of prime importance these days [25]. Examples of such commercial models include ad-sponsored map services, and low-cost, added-value paid services supporting the free service like Google Earth plus and Google Earth Pro . Microsoft also provides an alternative ad-supported, but still free, ""commercialized"" version of their MSN Virtual Earth Map Control for commercial Web sites [26].Associated individual privacy, national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues ::: DiscussionThe Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) work on Geospatial Digital Rights Management (GeoDRM) is also poised to become an important enabler in the context of geo-data and map copyrights [27]. A great deal of work has already been done in the area of data ownership and rights management for the online e-book, video and music industries, with some mature working solutions already in existence from companies like Macrovision , Microsoft ( and ) and Adobe . Such developments are of interest to the geospatial community in that many geospatial data providers need to control or track who has access to their data and how the data are used. The lack of a GeoDRM capability has been identified as a major barrier to the broader adoption of Web-based geospatial technologies. The mission of OGC GeoDRM Working Group is to coordinate and mature the development and validation of work being done on digital rights management for the geospatial community [27].ConclusionGoogle and MSN's worldwide distribution of ""free"" geospatial tools, imagery, maps and, eventually, in future versions of their products, analysis capabilities, is to be commended. Building on the powerful and universal visual language of geography, they succeeded in making their customizable multi-purpose maps and imagery of the world familiar and accessible to millions of ordinary Web users around the globe from outside the fields of specialized geosciences. Although ESRI have announced their planned response to Google (and MSN), it remains to be seen how their envisaged plans will materialize and compare to the offerings from Google and MSN, and also how Google and MSN mapping tools will further evolve in the near future."
Unhealthy Landscapes: Policy Recommendations on Land Use Change and Infectious Disease Emergence,"Deforestation Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceRates of deforestation have grown exponentially since the beginning of the 20th century. Driven by rapidly increasing human population numbers, large swaths of species-rich tropical and temperate forests, as well as prairies, grasslands, and wetlands, have been converted to species-poor agricultural and ranching areas. The global rate of tropical deforestation continues at staggering levels, with nearly 2–3% of forests lost globally each year. Parallel with this habitat destruction is an exponential growth in human–wildlife interaction and conflict. This has resulted in exposure to new pathogens for humans, livestock, and wildlife (Wolfe et al. 2000). Deforestation and the processes that lead to it have many consequences for ecosystems. Deforestation decreases the overall habitat available for wildlife species. It also modifies the structure of environments, for example, by fragmenting habitats into smaller patches separated by agricultural activities or human populations. Increased “edge effect” (from a patchwork of varied land uses) can further promote interaction among pathogens, vectors, and hosts. This edge effect has been well documented for Lyme disease (Glass et al. 1995). Similarly, increased activity in forest habitats (through behavior or occupation) appears to be a major risk factor for leishmaniasis (Weigle et al. 1993). Evidence is mounting that deforestation and ecosystem changes have implications for the distribution of many other microorganisms and the health of human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations.Deforestation. ::: Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceOne example of the effects of land use on human health is particularly noteworthy. Deforestation, with subsequent changes in land use and human settlement patterns, has coincided with an upsurge of malaria and/or its vectors in Africa (Coluzzi 1984, 1994; Coluzzi et al. 1979), in Asia (Bunnag et al. 1979), and in Latin America (Tadei et al. 1998). When tropical forests are cleared for human activities, they are typically converted into agricultural or grazing lands. This process is usually exacerbated by construction of roads, causing erosion and allowing previously inaccessible areas to become colonized by people (Kalliola and Flores Paitán 1998). Cleared lands and culverts that collect rainwater are in some areas far more suitable for larvae of malaria-transmitting anopheline mosquitoes than are intact forests (Charlwood and Alecrim 1989; Jones 1951; Marques 1987).Deforestation. ::: Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceAnother example of the effects of land use on human health involves deforestation and noninfectious disease: the contamination of rivers with mercury. Soil erosion after deforestation adds significant mercury loads, which are found naturally in rainforest soils, to rivers. This has led to fish in the Amazon becoming hazardous to eat (Fostier et al. 2000; Veiga et al. 1994).Habitat fragmentation. ::: Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceThis alters the composition of host species in an environment and can change the fundamental ecology of microorganisms. Because of the nature of food webs within ecosystems, organisms at higher trophic levels exist at a lower population density and are often quite sensitive to changes in food availability. The smaller patches left after fragmentation often do not have sufficient prey for top predators, resulting in local extinction of predator species and a subsequent increase in the density of their prey species. Logging and road building in Latin America have increased the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis (Desjeux 2001), which in some areas has resulted from an increase in the number of fox reservoirs and sandfly vectors that have adapted to the peridomestic environment (Patz et al. 2000). Foxes, however, are not very important reservoirs for leishmaniasis in Latin America (Courtenay et al. 2002), and a more important factor in the transmission cycle includes domestic dogs.Habitat fragmentation. ::: Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceOstfeld and Keesing (2000) have demonstrated that smaller fragments in North American forests have fewer small mammal predators. Results suggest that the probability that a tick will become infected depends on not only the density of white-footed mice but also the density of mice relative to that of other hosts in the community. Under this scenario, the density effect of white-footed mice, which are efficient reservoirs for Lyme disease, can be “diluted” by an increasing density of alternative hosts, which are less efficient at transmitting Lyme disease. These results suggest that increasing host diversity (species richness) may decrease the risk of disease through a “dilution effect” (Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001).Extractive industries. ::: Changes to the biophysical environment. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceGold mining is an extractive industry that damages local and regional environments and has adverse human health effects, because mercury is used to extract gold from riverbeds in the tropical forests. Not only does mercury accumulate in local fish populations, making them toxic to eat (Lebel et al. 1996, 1998), but mercury also suppresses the human immune system. Also, in gold-mining areas, more mosquito-breeding sites and increased malaria risk result from digging gem pits in the forest and from craters resulting from logging; broader disease spread occurs as populations disperse throughout the region (Silbergeld et al. 2002).Zoonoses. ::: Movement of populations, pathogens, and trade. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceThe importance of zoonotic diseases should be emphasized. Zoonotic pathogens are the most significant cause of EIDs affecting humans, both in the proportion of EIDs that they cause and in the impact that they have. Some 1,415 species of infectious organisms are known to be pathogenic to people, with 61% of them being zoonotic. Of the emerging pathogens, 75% are zoonotic, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than are nonzoonotic pathogens (Taylor et al. 2001). More important, zoonotic pathogens cause a series of EIDs with high case fatality rates and no reliable cure, vaccine, or therapy (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Nipah virus disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome). Zoonotic pathogens also cause diseases that have some of the highest incidence rates globally [e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]. AIDS is a special case, because it is caused by a pathogen that jumped host from nonhuman primates and then evolved into a new virus. Thus, it is in origin a zoonotic organism (Hahn et al. 2000).Zoonoses. ::: Movement of populations, pathogens, and trade. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceBecause of the important role of zoonoses in current public health threats, wildlife and domestic animals play a key role in the process by providing a “zoonotic pool” from which previously unknown pathogens may emerge (Daszak et al. 2001). The influenza virus is an example, causing pandemics in humans after periodic exchange of genes among the viruses of wild and domestic birds, pigs, and humans. Fruit bats are involved in a high-profile group of EIDs that includes rabies and other lyssaviruses, Hendra virus and Menangle virus (Australia), and Nipah virus (Malaysia and Singapore), which has implications for further zoonotic disease emergence. A number of species are endemic to both remote oceanic islands and more populous suburban and rural human settlements; these may harbor enzootic and potentially zoonotic pathogens with an unknown potential for spillover (Daszak et al. 2000).Zoonoses. ::: Movement of populations, pathogens, and trade. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceThus, some of the current major infectious threats to human health are EIDs and reemerging infectious diseases, with a particular emphasis on zoonotic pathogens transferring hosts from wildlife and domestic animals. A common, defining theme for most EIDs (of humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and plants) is that they are driven to emerge by anthropogenic changes to the environment. Because threats to wildlife habitat are so extensive and pervading, many of the currently important human EIDs (e.g., AIDS, Nipah virus disease) are driven partly by human-induced changes to wildlife habitat such as encroachment and deforestation. This is essentially a process of natural selection in which anthropogenic environmental changes perturb the host–parasite dynamic equilibrium, leading to the expansion of those strains suited to the new environmental conditions and facilitating expansion of others into new host species (Daszak et al. 2001).Crop irrigation and breeding sites. ::: Agriculture. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceAgriculture occupies about half of the world’s land and uses more than two-thirds of the world’s fresh water (Horrigan et al. 2002). Agricultural development in many parts of the world has increased the need for crop irrigation, which reduces water availability for other uses and increases breeding sites for disease vectors. An increase in soil moisture associated with irrigation development in the southern Nile Delta after the construction of the Aswan High Dam has caused a rapid rise in the mosquito Culex pipiens and consequential increase in the arthropod-borne disease Bancroftian filariasis (Harb et al. 1993; Thompson et al. 1996). Onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis are further examples of vector-borne parasitic diseases that may be triggered by changing land-use and water management patterns. In addition, large-scale use of pesticides has had deleterious effects on farm workers, including hormone disruption and immune suppression (Straube et al. 1999).Food-borne diseases. ::: Agriculture. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceOnce agricultural development has expanded and produced food sufficient to meet local need, the food products are exported to other nations, where they can pose a risk to human health. The increase in imported foods has resulted in a rise in food-borne illness in the United States. Strawberries from Mexico, raspberries from Guatemala, carrots from Peru, and coconut milk from Thailand have caused recent outbreaks. Food safety is an important factor in human health, because food-borne disease accounts for an estimated 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,200 deaths in the United States each year (CDC 2003). Other dangers include antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as Cyclospora, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and other pathogenic E. coli strains associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome in children (Dols et al. 2001).Secondary effects. ::: Agriculture. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceAgricultural secondary effects need to be minimized, such as the emerging microbial resistance from antibiotics in animal waste that is included in farm runoff and the introduction of microdams for irrigation in Ethiopia that resulted in a 7-fold increase in malaria (Ghebreyesus et al. 1999).Urbanization. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceOn a global basis, the proportion of people living in urban centers will increase to an unprecedented 65% by the year 2030 (Population Reference Bureau 1998). The 2000 census shows that 80% of the U.S. population now lives in metropolitan areas, with 30% living in cities of 5 million or more. The environmental issues posed by such large population centers have profound impacts on public health beyond the city limits (Knowlton 2001).Urbanization. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceAlterations of ecosystems and natural resources contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious disease agents. Human encroachment of wildlife habitat has broadened the interface between wildlife and humans, increasing opportunities for both the emergence of novel infectious diseases in wildlife and their transmission to people. Rabies is an example of a zoonotic disease carried by animals that has become habituated to urban environments. Bats colonize buildings, skunks and raccoons scavenge human refuse, and in many countries feral dogs in the streets are common and the major source of human infection (Singh et al. 2001).Urbanization. ::: Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease EmergenceInfectious diseases can also pass from people to wildlife. Nonhuman primates have acquired measles from ecotourists (Wallis and Lee 1999). Also, drug resistance in gram-negative enteric bacteria of wild baboons living with limited human contact is significantly less common than in baboons living with human contact near urban or semiurban human settlements (Rolland et al. 1985).The Land–Water InterfaceAnother major driver of infectious disease emergence results from the land–water interface. Land use changes often involve water projects or coastal marine systems in which nutrients from agricultural runoff can cause algal blooms.The Land–Water InterfaceCurrently the seventh cholera pandemic is spreading across Asia, Africa, and South America. In 1992, a new serogroup (Vibrio cholerae O139) appeared and has been responsible for epidemics in Asia (Colwell 1996). The seasonality of cholera epidemics may be linked to the seasonality of plankton (algal blooms) and the marine food chain. Studies using remote-sensing data of chlorophyll-containing phytoplankton have shown a correlation between cholera cases and sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal. Interannual variability in cholera incidence in Bangladesh is also linked to the El Niño southern oscillation and regional temperature anomalies (Lobitz et al. 2000), and cholera prevalence has been associated with progressively stronger El Niño events spanning a 70-year period (Rodo et al. 2002). This observation on cholera incidence may represent an early health indicator of global climate change (Patz 2002).The Land–Water InterfaceInfectious diseases in marine mammals and sea turtles could serve as sentinels for human disease risk. Sea turtles worldwide are affected by fibropapillomatosis, a disease probably caused by one or several viruses and characterized by multiple epithelial tumors. Field studies support the observation that prevalence of this disease is associated with heavily polluted coastal areas, areas of high human density, agricultural runoff, and/or biotoxin-producing algae (Aguirre and Lutz, in press). This represents the breakdown of the land–water interface, to the point that several pathogens typical of terrestrial ecosystems have become established in the oceans. Toxoplasmosis in the endangered sea otter (Enhydra lutris) represents an example of pathogen pollution. Massive mortalities in pinnipeds and cetaceans reaching epidemics of tens of thousands are caused by four morbilliviruses evolving from the canine distemper virus (Aguirre et al. 2002). Additionally, overfishing has myriad ramifications for marine ecosystems and sustainable protein food sources for human populations.The Land–Water InterfaceCryptosporidium, a protozoan that completes its life cycle within the intestine of mammals, sheds high numbers of infectious oocysts that are dispersed in feces. A recent study found that 13% of finished treated water still contained Cryptosporidium oocysts, indicating some passage of microorganisms from source to treated drinking water (LeChevallier and Norton 1995). The protozoan is highly prevalent in ruminants and is readily transmitted to humans. Thus, management of livestock contamination of watersheds is an important public health issue.The Land–Water InterfaceOne example of how overexploitation of a natural water resource led to infectious disease is that of Lake Malawi in Africa. Overfishing in the lake reduced the population of snail-eating fish to such a level that snail populations erupted. Subsequently, schistosomiasis incidence and prevalence markedly rose after this ecologic imbalance (Madsen et al. 2001).Conceptual model: bringing land use into public health policy. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupThe recommendations stemming from the international colloquium are highly relevant to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), a broad multiagency/foundation-sponsored scientific assessment of degraded ecosystem effects on human well-being. A conceptual framework of the MEA already provides an approach to optimize the contribution of ecosystems to human health (MEA 2003). This framework offers a mechanism to a) identify options that can better achieve human development and sustainable goals, b) better understand the trade-offs involved in environment-related decisions, and c) align response options at all scales, from the local to the global, where they can be most effective. This conceptual framework focuses on human well-being while also recognizing associated intrinsic values. Similar to the MEA, focus is particularly on the linkages between ecosystem services and human health. Workshop participants developed a conceptual model (Figure 1). Like the MEA, it assumes a dynamic interaction between humans and ecosystems that warrants a multiscale assessment (spatial and temporal).Conceptual model: bringing land use into public health policy. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupBy using this framework, policy makers may approach development and health at various levels. These levels include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. For sound health policy, we must shift away from dealing primarily with specific risk factors and look “upstream” to underlying land-use determinants of infectious disease and ultimately the human behavior and established institutions that are detrimental to sustainable population health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a similar DPSEEA (driving forces, pressures, state, exposure, effect, actions) model that in a similar way describes the interlinkage between human health and different driving forces and environmental change (WHO 1997).Conceptual model: bringing land use into public health policy. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupAs such understanding increases, it will become more feasible to plan how to prevent new infectious disease emergence. Yet, because these are rare events, accurate predictions will remain daunting. It is already evident that inserting humans into complex ecosystems can lead to a variety of EIDs, but health outcomes depend on the economic circumstances of the human population. In poor and tropical communities, land use change can lead to major shifts in infectious disease patterns. For these situations, many conventional public health interventions can prevent several infectious diseases at relatively low cost. In rich and temperate-climate communities, the infectious disease shifts tend to be more disease specific, for example, in the case of Lyme disease and habitat fragmentation.Research on deforestation and infectious disease. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupConsidering the deforestation that usually accompanies agricultural development, new conservation-oriented agriculture should be pursued. As discussed above, water project development and modern livestock management present major health disease risks. However, often the secondary unintended consequences can also wreak havoc; for example, a leaking dam may present greater risks than the reservoir itself. A distressingly large number of development projects not only have adverse effects on human health but also fail to attain their primary economic purposes in a sustainable manner.Research on deforestation and infectious disease. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupHabitat fragmentation, whether caused by forest destruction, desertification, or land-use conversion, affects human and wildlife health and ecosystem processes. There is already much research undertaken by landscape ecologists on the consequences of habitat fragmentation for wildlife, especially larger animals. It would be important to study the effects of landscape fragmentation on public health hazards. Such research could entail three components. The first component consists of gathering baseline data, including using historical data where possible and beginning monitoring programs where necessary. Key data include identifying and quantifying the relevant pathogen load of wildlife, livestock, and human communities in fragmented landscapes. The goals of this data collection are, first, to identify key infectious diseases, both chronic and emergent or reemergent and, second, to document the consequences of fragmentation on relative abundance of wildlife and subsequent pathogen load. For example, the loss of large predators in fragmented habitats in the northeastern United States has led to a superabundance of rodent vectors for Lyme disease.Research on deforestation and infectious disease. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupThe second component of the research program would involve health impact modeling, primarily in three areas: a) estimating changes in the relative abundance of organisms, including infectious disease vectors, pathogens, and hosts; b) projecting potential vector or transmission shifts (e.g., should the Nipah virus shift to pulmonary as well as neurologic expression in humans as in swine); and c) projecting the impact of infectious diseases in a region on different geographic scales.Research on deforestation and infectious disease. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupThe results of these analyses, if successful, could support the third component of research: development of decision-support tools. Improved decisions on land-use policy could be made from a better understanding of costs and benefits to health and environmental decision makers. In all probability, however, they will be very location specific. For example, to construct an irrigation scheme in India would likely invite a malaria epidemic, whereas the same activity in sub-Saharan Africa may have little effect on malaria transmission. It is worth mentioning that costs and benefits could depend on the time course over which they are assessed. For example, some land-use changes can lead to short-term increases in transmission followed by longer-term decreases (e.g., irrigation and malaria in Sri Lanka) or vice versa (e.g., deforestation and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Latin America).Policies to reduce microbial traffic/pathogen pollution. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupIn today’s interconnected world, it becomes very important to invest in the worldwide control of infectious diseases in developing countries, for example. It is also necessary to control transport to stem the flow from one place to the next.Policies to reduce microbial traffic/pathogen pollution. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupImproved monitoring of trade is warranted in order to target infectious disease introductions. In the attempt to prevent the invasion of a pathogen (and drug-resistant organisms) into the vulnerable areas subject to land use changes, we need to pay greater attention to controls at the sources. We need to document and map these trades and investigate the vectors, the infectious diseases they harbor, and the populations they threaten. Risk assessment should guide surveillance and the development of test kits, targeting point-of-origin intervention to preempt these processes. Assessments must further include nonmarket costs (usually to the detriment of the environment and long-term sustainable health). We should communicate to both the exporters and consumers the need to make their trades clean, economically viable, and certified “clean and green” by an independent scientific agency at the source and/or destination. Additionally, strategies for screening travelers for pathogens that may be introduced to a region should be improved.Implementing research and policy programs. ::: Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupIn selecting areas for research and the placement of centers of excellence, it is important to choose geographically representative, highly diverse areas around the world. In addition, research projects should take place in regions or landscapes that have both well characterized and less characterized patterns of infectious disease emergence or transmission for comparison purposes. Local health and environment professionals, who are in the best position to understand local priorities, should make the choices within each region for initial research areas and sites.Addressing trade-offs among environment, health, and development. ::: Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training. ::: Recommendations from the Working GroupThere are some inherent trade-offs when considering land-use change and health. They are ethical values, environmental versus health choices, and disparities in knowledge and economic class. Trade-offs are between short-term benefit and long-term damage. For example, draining swamps may reduce vector-borne disease hazards but also destroy the wetland ecosystem and its inherent services (e.g., water storage, water filtration, biologic productivity, and habitats for fish and wildlife). Research can help decision making by identifying and assessing trade-offs in different land-use-change scenarios. Balancing the diverse needs of people, livestock, wildlife, and the ecosystem will always be a prominent feature.Encouraging initiatives. ::: ConclusionsThree new initiatives are rising to the challenges presented above. The first initiative, the Consortium for Conservation Medicine (CCM), was formed recently to address these health challenges at the interface of ecology, wildlife health, and public health (Figure 2). At its core, conservation medicine champions the integration of techniques and partnering of scientists from diverse disciplines, particularly veterinary medicine, conservation biology, and public health. Through the consortium, therefore, these experts work with educators, policy makers, and conservation program managers to devise approaches that improve the health of both species and humans simultaneously [more information is available from the CCM website (CCM 2004)].Encouraging initiatives. ::: ConclusionsThe second initiative, the new international journal EcoHealth, focuses on the integration of knowledge at the intersection of ecologic and health sciences. The journal provides a gathering place for research and reviews that integrate the diverse knowledge of ecology, health, and sustainability, whether scientific, medical, local, or traditional. The journal will encourage development and innovation in methods and practice that link ecology and health, and it will ensure clear and concise presentation to facilitate practical and policy application [more information is available from the EcoHealth website (EcoHealth 2004)].Encouraging initiatives. ::: ConclusionsThe third initiative, the MEA, is an international work program designed to meet the needs of decision makers and the public for scientific information concerning the consequences of ecosystem change for human health and well-being and for options in responding to those changes. This assessment was launched by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in June 2001 and will help to meet the assessment needs of international environmental forums, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the Convention on Migratory Species, as well as the needs of other users in the private sector and civil society [more information is available from the Millennium Assessment Working Groups website (Millennium Assessment Working Groups 2004)].Challenges ahead. ::: ConclusionsAs this working group of researchers continues to work on these topics, we face three challenges. First, strong trans-disciplinary research partnerships need to be forged to approach the research with the degree of creative thinking and comprehensiveness required by the nature of the problems. Second, if the work is to influence policy, the choice of questions and the research must be undertaken collaboratively with the local community and also through discussion with decision makers in government, industry, civil society, and other sectors. Third, investigators must consider how they can integrate their findings into the social, economic, and political dialogue on both the environment and health, globally and locally. As links between land use and health are elucidated, an informed public will more readily use such discoveries to better generate political will for effective change."
The National Children’s Study: A Critical National Investment,"Patterns of disease in American children have changed dramatically in the past 200 years. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis notwithstanding, vaccines, antibiotics, and improved hygiene have controlled the classic infectious diseases. Infant mortality has decreased by 90%. Life expectancy has nearly doubled. Yet amid this success a new challenge has arisen. Chronic diseases have increased sharply in incidence and have become the leading causes of childhood illness:Although much remains to be learned about the causes of these trends, evidence is accumulating that environmental factors make important contributions.Until now, progress in elucidating the role of the environment in chronic childhood disease has been slow and incremental. Nearly all studies have examined relatively small populations of children; have considered only one chemical toxicant at a time; have had little statistical power to examine interactions among chemical, social, and behavioral factors in the environment; have had limited ability to examine gene–environment interactions (Olden 2004); and have suffered from brief duration of follow-up. Also, many previous studies have been retrospective in design and thus have been forced to estimate past exposures from limited and sometimes biased historical data.To overcome these difficulties, the President’s Task Force on Environmental Health and Safety Risks to Children recommended in 1998 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2004) that a large prospective epidemiologic study of American children be undertaken. In response, the U.S. Congress through the Children’s Health Act of 2000 authorized the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) “to conduct a national longitudinal study of environmental influences (including physical, chemical, biological and psychosocial) on children’s health and development” (Children’s Health Act 2000). The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the CDC, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) join the NICHD in planning and conducting this study.Key features of this far-reaching study—now termed the National Children’s Study (NCS)—are that it will follow a representative sample of 100,000 American children from early pregnancy through age 21; a subset maybe recruited before conception. Exposure histories and biologic samples will be obtained during pregnancy and from children as they grow, obviating the need for retrospective assessments of exposures. The large sample size will facilitate simultaneous examination of the effects of multiple chemical exposures, of interactions among them, and of interactions among biologic, chemical, behavioral, and social factors. Each child will be screened genetically, thus permitting study of gene–environment interactions. Follow-up will extend over decades. For the past four years, working groups convened by NICHD have been developing the NCS: formulating core hypotheses, delineating research protocols, and planning logistics. The study is now ready for the field.Previous major prospective epidemiologic studies have yielded invaluable gains in knowledge of disease causation and have provided critical tools for prevention and treatment. The Framingham Heart Study (Framingham, MA), for example, was established in 1948 at a time when heart disease and stroke were epidemic in the United States. The goal was to identify preventable risk factors. Within a few years, data from Framingham identified cigarette smoking (Dawber 1960) and elevated cholesterol and hypertension as preventable causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Kannel et al. 1961, 1978); later analyses elucidated the role of elevated triglycerides, sedentary lifestyle, and diabetes. This information provided the blueprint for the major reductions in incidence of CVD that we have achieved in the United States over the past four decades (CDC 1999).We anticipate that the NCS will yield equally enormous societal benefits. Six of the chronic diseases that the study plans to examine —obesity, injury, asthma, diabetes, schizophrenia, and autism—cost America $642 billion per year (Bromet and Fennig 1999; CDC 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2004d, 2004e, 2004f, 2004g; National Alliance for Autism Research 2002; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001; Weiss 2001; Yeargin-Allsop et al. 2002). If the NCS were to produce a reduction of only 1% in incidence of these diseases, the annual savings would amount to $6.4 billion, far more than the $2.7 billion price tag of the study over 25 years.Despite the enormous potential of the NCS, its funding is in critical jeopardy. In each of the past 4 years, the annual budget has been $12 million, a sum provided by contributions from the NICHD, the NIEHS, the CDC, and the U.S. EPA. But now to move the study forward, there is need in 2005 to establish a data-coordinating center, a repository for secure storage of biologic samples, and a series of regionally distributed vanguard recruitment sites. For these tasks, NICHD needs $15 million in new dollars above their regular budget. Without at least $27 million in federal funding in 2005, NICHD will likely be forced to cancel or at least postpone the study.The NCS has benefited from strong and bipartisan leadership in Congress and from the support of a broad-based coalition that includes the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the American Chemistry Council, the Learning Disabilities Association, and the March of Dimes. But still it is in dire fiscal peril.The NCS represents an extraordinary opportunity. If the study receives the funding that it needs in 2005, it will begin as early as 2009 to produce data that will save children’s lives and improve their health. The NCS is a national investment in the future that for the sake of our children we must make today."
Understanding the Spatial Clustering of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong,"Data sources. ::: Materials and MethodsWe used spatial and nonspatial data in this study. Spatial data are geographic in nature and have a physical dimension or location in the real world. These are represented as points, lines, or area symbols, and they form the map base upon which SARS occurrences are depicted. Data on SARS incidence were derived from case-contact interviews that are text based; associated residential address data were first cleaned, checked for completeness and accuracy (e.g., Chinese-English transliteration of building and street names), and then geo-referenced to enable mapping.Data sources. ::: Materials and MethodsWe analyzed the SARSID integrated database (coordinated by the Department of Community Medicine, University of Hong Kong, on behalf of the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau—derived from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority eSARS system and the Department of Health’s Master List), which contained details on all patients confirmed to have SARS and admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong throughout the entire epidemic, that is, from 15 February to 22 June 2003. The criteria for inclusion in the SARSID were radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, fever ≥38°C or history of such at any time in the past 2 days, and at least two of the following: a) history of chills in the past 2 days; b) cough (new or increased cough) or breathing difficulty; c) general malaise or myalgia; and d) known history of exposure. However, patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain their illness. Moreover, each case classified as confirmed SARS was verified by the Hong Kong Department of Health according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on case definitions (WHO 2003). Eighty-two percent of the 1,755 cases listed as confirmed SARS had either reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction results positive for SARS-CoV or a 4-fold increase in IgG antibodies in paired sera (at admission and 21 or 28 days after symptom onset). Two questionnaires (case questionnaire and case-contact survey) were administered, mostly through telephone interviews, to all SARS cases confirmed by the Department of Health, initially by four regional field offices and later by a central interviewing team of nurses, to record symptoms at presentation to the hospital and to identify contacts and events of probable significance to transmission.Data sources. ::: Materials and MethodsA total of 1,709 confirmed cases (out of 1,755 total cases) were extracted for the analysis. Forty-six cases (i.e., 2.6% of the total) could not be pinpointed at an exact location because of inconsistencies in the address entries (So 2002).Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsWe carried out three levels of analysis: a) an elementary analysis involving simple visual inspection of a geographic phenomenon; b) a cluster analysis attempting the identification of possible “hot spots,” and c) a contextual analysis aiming to explain relationships among geographic phenomena (Bailey and Gatrell 1995; Olson 1976).Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsAt the elementary level, the spread of a disease in a community is revealed through the plotting of disease occurrences at residential addresses of the patients enabled with the address matching function in a GIS. Point by point is the simplest form of mapping disease occurrences without accounting for the magnitude at each location, but the sheer number and spread of points could have impeded effective reading of the event. A map of cumulative counts collapses the numerous observations into circles of varying sizes to signify differences in the magnitude of disease occurrences in the community. The circles are proportionally sized to reflect the number of occurrences at the sites, and geographic clustering of disease infection can then be clearly identified.Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsWe also examined the spread of SARS over time on the basis of point patterns. Each disease occurrence was plotted spatially and the spread or dispersion of disease incidence was examined using nearest neighbor analysis based on the R scale. The nearest neighbor analysis is an accepted spatial statistical analysis used by environmental scientists to study species distribution (Krebs 1989) and by crime analysts to explain the levels of dispersion in crime and disorder data (Eck and Weisburd 1995). The R scale assumes that events will be randomly spaced unless something influences the distribution. Three different patterns are possible: clustered (0 ≤R < 0.8), distributed randomly (0.8 ≤R < 1.8), or with uniform spacing (1.8 ≤R ≤2.149). A contagious process will give rise to a clustered pattern with near-zero R values.Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsCluster analysis involves statistical mapping that generalizes the numerous observations into a statistical surface to highlight spatial variation. A 5-day incubation period, consistent with a previous gamma distribution parameter estimation exercise (Leung et al., in press), was used to restructure the data for a time-series study. A statistical surface was created by the kernel method (Bailey and Gatrell 1995) for each day to reveal daily changes of disease hot spots. A kernel size of 300 × 300 m2 was used to reconstruct the territory of Hong Kong into a gridded surface of 208 columns and 151 rows. The kernel size was 300 × 300 m2, and disease occurrences within a bandwidth of 600 m from the kernel were summarized to yield density measures in terms of number of SARS cases per square meter. Each grid was then designated either as urban or suburban based upon land use classification, and its associated density measure was adjusted for the underlying variation in population density (i.e., kernel density × population density × grid cell size/1,000) to yield infection rates per 1,000 population. We adopted the approach by Kafadar (1996) but modified it to account for variation between urban or suburban population densities within a given district in Hong Kong (Table 1). Each urban or suburban grid was considered a homogeneous unit wherein its population density was apportioned according to the proportion of residents in the employed labor force.Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsWe created 12 kernel maps adjusted for population at risk to characterize changes in disease hot spots on 12 prototypical days over 16 weeks in a chronologic sequence. The infection rates, which span across a wide range, were collapsed into 15 classes to reduce the complexity of map representation. Each of the 15 classes was assigned a shade in proportion to the magnitudes, with darker shades representing higher densities of infection. Two kinds of indexes were employed to assess the extent of disease clustering: R scale and Moran’s I coefficient for more highly connected grids of the queen’s case that considers a neighborhood of eight cells in a 3 × 3 matrix. Moran’s I coefficient ranges between −1 and 1 and is interpreted as regionalized or juxtaposition of similar values (0.6 ≤I ≤1 indicating positive spatial autocorrelation), lack of autocorrelation, or the actual arrangement of values as one that we would expect from a random distribution (−0.6 < I < 0.6 indicating no spatial correlation), and either contrasting or tendency for dissimilar values to cluster (−1 ≤I ≤−0.6 indicating negative spatial correlation). Although R scale is a global measure for the spread or dispersion of disease incidence for point data based on nearest neighbor distance (Eck and Weisburd 1995; Krebs 1989; Taylor 1977), Moran’s coefficient measures local spatial autocorrelation for area data (Getis and Ord 1992; Sawada 2001). A comparison of the power evaluation of disease clustering tests has been described by Song and Kulldorff (2003).Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsFor contextual analysis, histograms of the kernel data for 12 prototypical days were drawn to highlight variation in infection rates. Also, we replaced mean and SDs of the classed density data with their natural logarithm functions to accentuate the effect of change between near-zero values; we then graphed the values.Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsWe also established a breakdown of disease occurrences by recognized clusters (e.g., SSEs) for contextual analysis. Three disease clusters each with > 30 observations were extracted: AMOY, Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), and Lower Ngau Tau Kok Housing Estate (NTKLOW). These data were used to derive origin-and-destination (OD) plots or flow diagrams. Lines were drawn to connect an origin location where the flow started (e.g., index source of infection) with related destinations where the flow ended (e.g., residences of secondary contacts). The OD plots are an established methodology employed by transport professionals and human geographers to examine the extent of spatial interaction and human settlement, as well as the modeling of commodity flows (Batten and Boyce 1986). The flow data themselves can be people, goods, telecommunications, and so on. The lines help to delimit the spatial coverage revealing the extent or degree of spread. SD ellipses centered on the geometric mean of all locations were drawn to provide a summary trend of the dispersion and to examine whether a distribution has a directional bias. The major axis is the direction of maximum spread of the point events, and the minor axis is the direction of minimum spread.Geostatistical analyses. ::: Materials and MethodsAll analyses were carried out using ArcGIS software and its extension modules (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA).Elementary analysis. ::: ResultsFigure 1 illustrates geographic locations of SARS infection by residential address in Hong Kong. The size of the circle corresponds to the density of cases in a particular location. There was clear clustering of cases in certain districts of the Kowloon peninsula (Kwun Tong, in which AMOY is located) and the New Territories (including Shatin, Tai Po), but Hong Kong Island was relatively spared. Table 2 supports this observation: most affected buildings or apartment blocks had very few cases, whereas seven buildings had > 10 SARS-affected patients.Cluster analysis. ::: ResultsA series of 12 kernel maps based on date of symptom onset and accounting for a 5-day incubation period of SARS is presented in Figure 2. Each kernel map shows the density of SARS patients adjusted for underlying population density (i.e., SARS infection rate per 1,000 population) on a prototypical day over 16 weeks, with darker zones emphasizing disease hot spots [see also daily animated series by Lai and Chan (2004)]. A few disease hot spots were shown to be developing in the Kowloon peninsula and southeast New Territories (i.e., Ma On Shan and Shatin) by 10 March, which was followed later by a heavy concentration at the AMOY by 28 March. By early April, the AMOY case load began to dissipate and a new hot spot emerged in Tai Po (northeast New Territories). There is clear evidence of varying degrees of clustering as the epidemic progressed over time based on the low R values. The low R values signify substantial degrees of clustering (significant at 99% confidence level), with higher degrees of clustering occurring around the peak of the infection and relatively small divergences from random distribution at the beginning of the outbreak. High Moran’s I coefficients of ≥0.6 indicate that similar values tend to cluster together, which confirms the geospatial clustering and thus infectious nature of the disease, based on rates that were adjusted for the underlying population density. Figure 3 summarizes SARS hot spots in Hong Kong considering cumulative disease occurrences from February through June 2003. The map shows that the urban population was at higher risk of contracting SARS (Moran’s I = 0.78, p < 0.001), having already accounted for variation in population density.Contextual analysis. ::: ResultsDaily histograms of the number of observations by 15 classes of infection rates, primarily composed of inverse J-shaped curves, show an increased concentration of SARS occurrences toward the end of March (Figure 4). Figure 5 is a logarithmic plot of the mean and SD of the infection rates of the 12 prototypical days representing different stages of the epidemic; values for individual days are presented in Table 3. Pairwise comparisons between each of the prototypical days and day 1 (or the day of indifference) of the epidemic demonstrated no detectable difference between the mean infection rates throughout the epidemic. However, there were statistically significant differences, by the F-test at a 0.01 significance level, in the SDs of the middle 10 prototypical days compared to day 1, suggesting unequal population variances during much of the outbreak. Higher F-values indicate more unequal variance. Given that the SD is a measure of geographic dispersion, we can infer that a larger SD signifies a wider spread of the disease over the territory. The crossover points of the mean and SD curves in Figure 5 indicate, on the one end, the beginning of substantial disease spread across the territory, and on the other end, the subsidence of the epidemic. Therefore, the time from day 1 (18 February) through day 16 (6 March) was the prodrome of the epidemic, whereas days 86 (15 May) through 106 (4 June) marked the declining phase of the outbreak.Contextual analysis. ::: ResultsOD plots of disease clusters were obtained by linking patients’ places of residence with the likely or probable locations of index cases or environmental sources of infection as defined through contact tracing by public health authorities (Figure 6). PWH is a tertiary teaching hospital and the site of the first SSE and nosocomial cluster in the Hong Kong epidemic, whereas AMOY and NTKLOW were subsequent community SSE clusters that had a strong putative environmental etiology (viz., sewage pipes, building design, and poor environmental hygiene) in addition to human-to-human transmission [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) 2003; Wong and Hui 2004]. As would be expected because of a large patient catchment area, the PWH cluster was more geographically widespread (as supported by the SD ellipses in Figure 6D) compared with the AMOY cluster (Figure 6B), the sample size of which was one-third larger. The SD ellipses of the PWH cluster (Figure 6D) reveal a northwest–southeast directional trend of disease spread that extends over most of Hong Kong. The AMOY cluster was comparatively more localized, and the map had to be be enlarged to show the standard ellipses that exhibit an almost east–west directional trend of disease transmission (Figure 6B). The NTKLOW cluster (Figure 6F) was the least geographically widespread of the three SSEs, where the very compact spatial distribution must be magnified to visualize details of the SD ellipses.Contextual analysis. ::: ResultsFigure 7 and Table 4 show low R scores (a measure to inform the extent of disease spread) indicating a high degree of clustering for all three SSEs. The R values were significant at the 0.001 level, confirming that the point patterns exhibited a tendency toward clustering. Figure 7 also shows that block E of AMOY (the epicenter of the AMOY SSE), with a lower R score, exhibited a more compact geospatial arrangement in SARS infection than did other apartment blocks within AMOY. Visitors of ward 8A (the epicenter of the PWH SSE where the index patient of the cluster stayed) of the PWH were found to spread the disease farthest from its source of all the three clusters examined here, as would be expected for such a nosocomial outbreak at a tertiary referral hospital where SARS patients were densely aggregated on the ward but visiting relatives and friends returned home situated in different parts of Hong Kong (and not necessarily from the immediate surrounding neighborhood, given that the hospital is one of only two tertiary referral centers in the territory with a very wide catchment area). The NTKLOW cluster recorded the lowest R score, substantiating earlier observations from Figure 6.DiscussionOur findings show that GIS methods can be usefully employed during an acute infectious disease outbreak to reveal new geospatial information in addition to standard field epidemiologic analyses. This mapping and cartographic technique can provide visual display of information in both space and time simultaneously. When applied in real time during the onset and evolution of an epidemic, it can monitor and enhance understanding of the transmission dynamics of an infectious agent, thereby facilitating the design, implementation, and evaluation of potential intervention strategies. GIS can offer quantitative and statistical measures along with visualization tools to examine patterns of disease spread with respect to disease clusters. Disease mapping is a first step toward understanding spatial aspects of health-related problems, as particular kinds of information are highlighted in maps. Various cartographic symbolizations (as points, lines, or areal patterns) can show the distribution of diseases. Disease clusters and other associations can then be deduced statistically and visually after examining the disease maps. In Chomsky’s (1965) terms, analyses at the first two levels concern the surface structure of an event, whereas the third level seeks to extract deep structure information. Surface structure information is simple and immediately perceptible to a user, whereas deep structure information is content-specific knowledge needed for problem solving (Nyerges 1991).DiscussionIn the case of SARS in Hong Kong, our study, first and foremost, demonstrates exceptional spatial clustering of the cases. The kernel method adjusted for population density provided a means of highlighting population at risk, whereas the use of R values and Moran’s coefficients in conjunction with map displays enhanced the analytical context of the point pattern distributions. In fact, such geospatial intelligence gathered from examining statistical surfaces and disease clusters provided the basis for the formulation of our transmission dynamics model (Riley et al. 2003). More specifically, choice of a suitable framework was not straightforward in constructing the transmission dynamics model where a variety of approaches were possible, ranging from a simple deterministic compartmental approach to a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation. Given the data available for Hong Kong, we based our analyses on a stochastic metapopulation compartmental model. A metapopulation approach was appropriate because the incidence of SARS varied substantially by geographical district, as the GIS analyses have shown.DiscussionSecond, the simultaneous geospatial–temporal approach to modeling the SARS outbreak revealed complementary additional information that would otherwise not be available from the traditional epidemic curve method (a standard public health outbreak investigative approach) in identifying the mode of spread. The daily animated series of kernel maps clearly shows that SARS was a highly localized disease; thus, its route of transmission was unlikely to be through casual contact, as it is for influenza and measles, but more compatible with close contact via heavy respiratory droplets and fomites. This confirms that SARS is only a moderately transmissible condition with a basic reproduction number of about 3 (Riley et al. 2003), in contrast to measles and influenza, which have basic reproduction numbers of about 13 and 5, respectively (Anderson and May 1991; Ferguson et al. 2003). An alternative interpretation of the observed high degree of geospatial clustering would be that SARS was due to an environmental point source outbreak. Indeed, faulty sewage systems and the “chimney effect” is the leading hypothesis explaining the AMOY SSE (especially block E), although some have suggested roof rats as a vector (Ng 2004). Although it is difficult to gauge retrospectively, had the GIS system we implemented in this report been available for near real-time analysis, it would likely have detected the highly unusual clustering of cases in SSEs such as the PWH and AMOY outbreaks much sooner, as they evolved. This in turn could have resulted in more rapid contact tracing and public health intervention, thus perhaps mitigating the extent of spread substantially in the case of person-to-person transmission events and preventing further large-scale environmental point source outbreaks in residential apartment blocks (although it would not have made a difference to AMOY itself given the temporally abrupt and short-lived environmental release of viral particles).DiscussionThird, contextual analysis of mean and SD values of different density classes, particularly after logarithmic transformation to accentuate near zero values on a graph, provided a geographic approach to estimating the beginning and subsidence of a large degree of spread of SARS in the community. This is a useful adjunct to the usual biomathematical modeling approach using reproductive numbers at different points in time, representing the average number of infections, excluding SSEs, caused by infected individuals in successive generations at time t throughout the SARS epidemic (Riley et al. 2003).DiscussionFourth, the SD ellipses from the OD analysis, coupled with complementary results from R and Moran’s I values, yielded information on the direction of spread in a disease cluster that can be used to inform contact tracing and the design of quarantine measures. In the case of SARS in China, where entire residential districts were cordoned off for weeks at the height of the outbreak, the selection of such districts for quarantine could have been better informed by these ellipses indicating directional bias and associated physical distance in disease transmission.DiscussionThere are, however, limitations and caveats to the GIS technique in infectious disease epidemiology and outbreak investigation. Howe (1963) argued that mapping of diseases tended to expose the “where” but not “why there” of the outbreak. Nevertheless, elementary descriptive analysis as an output of disease mapping can be a source of new leads for further exploratory analyses. Map patterns can provide stimuli for generating hypotheses of disease causation (Lloyd and Yu 1994; McKee et al. 2000). Moreover, newer developments that complement traditional mapping functions such as cluster and contextual analyses can be very useful adjunct investigative tools in outbreak control, as our example on SARS in Hong Kong has highlighted.DiscussionThe completeness and availability of necessary data are another area of potential concern where conventional field epidemiologic data collection forms rarely contain the full range of variables that are required in a GIS analysis. Data consistency and, in particular, the nonstandardization of patient address formats is one such example. Field epidemiologists often relegate certain personal particulars such as residential and work addresses to a lower priority in their data collection procedures, or at least enter the information in a haphazard fashion, rendering GIS analysis very difficult by diminishing the proportion of usable cases for analyses. Similar generic problems that plague the establishment of all information systems must be resolved to enable real-time disease monitoring and surveillance. They include lack of standardization for data capture documents, procedures and protocols for information management, delays in transferring and updating information, and a lack of rapid analysis and audit of databases. The SARS epidemic is a clear signal that Hong Kong needs much greater and sustained investment in health informatics, that is, public health information systems, the skills to use them, and networks to share them.DiscussionIn summary, integration of GIS technology into routine field epidemiologic surveillance can offer a scientifically rigorous and quantitative method for identification of unusual disease patterns in real time, as our example of SARS has shown. Its potential can be synergistically maximized when linked with clinical databases collecting data at the point of care across the whole population as well as environmental data sources (e.g., meteorologic, transportation, topographical information) to rapidly recognize, locate, and monitor disease outbreaks."
An atypical RNA pseudoknot stimulator and an upstream attenuation signal for −1 ribosomal frameshifting of SARS coronavirus,"The ribosomal frameshifting is a translational regulation mechanism adopted by a variety of viruses to synthesize two or more proteins at a fixed ratio starting with a single translation initiation site from the same open reading frame (ORF) (1–4). In response to the programmed frameshifting signals in messenger RNA (mRNA), the ribosome is induced to move one base backward in the 5′ direction, and then continues translation in the new −1 reading frame. The ratio between the two protein products from frameshifting can be determined by the frameshift efficiency of the stimulation signals and can be a key factor for the propagation of virus within the host. It has been suggested to be a potential antiviral target for the interference of viral propagation (5).INTRODUCTIONEfficient induction of eukaryotic −1 ribosomal frameshifting requires two in cis RNA elements (1,6). The first one is a hepta-nucleotides' slippery site sequence of X XXY YYZ, where the recoding occurs. Analysis indicated X can be any three identical nucleotides whereas Y represents three A or U, and Z is A, U or C. In addition, a downstream stimulator RNA structure located 6–7 nt away from the slippery site is also needed for efficient frameshifting. This downstream RNA stimulator is usually an H-type RNA pseudoknot in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop form base pairs with single-stranded region outside the hairpin. This leads to a topology featuring two helical stems of base pairing region (stems 1 and 2) connected by two single-stranded loops (loops 1 and 2) with a quasi-continuous RNA double-helical structure. However, not all RNA pseudoknots can stimulate −1 frameshifting and non-pseudoknot RNA element has been characterized to be responsible for inducing −1 frameshifting in HIV-1 (7,8).INTRODUCTIONThe reported −1 frameshift efficiency induced by different RNA pseudoknots range from 1 to 4% for Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) in plant cells to 25 and 50% for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), respectively, in animal cells (6,9,10). There is no clear picture to correlate frameshift efficiency with a specific RNA pseudoknot stimulator. However, it is thought that resistance of a pseudoknot against deformation by a marching ribosome can cause the elongating ribosome to pause (3,11–13). This will position the A- and P-site transfer RNAs (tRNAs) over the slippery site and, thus, increases the probability for ribosome to slip its A- and P-site tRNAs in the 5′ direction by one base and resume the translation in the new reading frame. Parameters known to affect frameshift efficiency include sequence identity of the slippery site and its distance to the stimulator RNA, stability of the stimulator and interactions among the ribosome, the mRNA template and the associated tRNAs (1). Recently, the sequence identity of the spacer and the E-site tRNA have both been shown to modulate frameshift efficiency (14,15) as well. In addition, host factors have also been implicated to involve in efficiency modulation (16,17).INTRODUCTIONThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory illness caused by a human coronavirus (HCV). Both SARS CoV and IBV belong to Coronaviridae (18–20). The IBV is known to use a −1 frameshifting mechanism to generate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) crucial for viral RNA replication. The 5′ portion of the IBV genomic RNA that encodes the RdRp contains a slippery site of the sequences UUUAAAC, and is followed by an H-type RNA pseudoknot with an in-frame stop codon embedded within stem 1 of the folded pseudoknot. An elongating ribosome will fall from the viral RNA template without synthesizing RdRp if −1 frameshifting did not occur in front of this in-frame stop codon. Therefore, defining the biologically relevant mRNA secondary structure, which can regulate the −1 frameshift efficiency of the SARS CoV, may provide useful information for anti-SARS strategy. In this work, we report the identification of an atypical RNA pseudoknot of SARS CoV as an efficient RNA stimulator in promoting −1 frameshifting in vitro, and explore the role of different stem regions in-frameshift efficiency determination. In addition, we will also demonstrate that particular viral RNA sequences upstream of the slippery site possess an attenuation effect on the overall −1 frameshift efficiency. It, thus, suggests that −1 ribosomal frameshifting can be attenuated by an RNA element upstream of the slippery site in addition to being promoted by a downstream RNA stimulator.Construction of reporter genes and mutagenesis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid encoding the gene for ORF 1ab junction region of SARS CoV, pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653 was a gift from Professor Pei-Jer Chen and was used as the template for PCR cloning of the cDNA of viral RNA fragments. The p2luc reporter was a gift from Professor John Atkins at the University of Utah (21) and the pRL-SV40 vector was purchased from Promega. Forward and reverse DNA primers, respectively, carrying the SalI and BamHI restriction sites and appropriately designed annealing sequences were used for PCR amplification of the desired cDNA encoding SARS CoV viral RNAs from pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653. The amplified inserts were then sub-cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of p2luc using standard procedures and the resulting recombinant vectors were transformed into DH5α cell for the maintenance and selection by ampicillin. Frameshifting stimulator sequences of the minimal IBV and MMTV pseudoknot were chemically synthesized. They were amplified by forward and reverse primers, respectively, containing BsrGI and BsaAI site, and ligated into the BsrGI/BsaAI site (1392/1426) of restriction enzymes treated pRL-SV40 vectors.Construction of reporter genes and mutagenesis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAll of the base pairing disruption and restoration mutants were constructed by using the quick-change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. In contrast, PCR-based ligation approach with appropriate primers was used to assemble different chimera, which carried the attenuation signal (the sequences are available upon request), and will be described briefly. Initially, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the sense and the antisense sequences corresponding to the 3′ end and 5′ star region of the two fragments planned to be jointed were synthesized chemically. They were then used as forward (sense) or reverse (antisense) primers in combination with the corresponding reverse or forward primer carrying appropriate restriction sites to amplify the desired pre-jointed fragments from pCRII-SARS12 265–13 653. The two individual PCR products with partially overlapping sequences were then assembled by the PCR-based ligation procedure (22), and then sub-cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of p2luc vectors. The identities of all cloned and mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis.RNA structure probing ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSRNA transcripts spanning the SARS13 377–13 475 region of SARS CoV were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The purified RNA of desired length was then dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 5′ end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and separated by a 12% sequencing gel. All the RNase protection experiments were performed in 50 μl reaction volumes containing 50 000–70 000 c.p.m. of 5′ end labeled RNA in the presence of RNase cleavage buffer (30 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM EDTA and 200 mM NaCl), and 10 mM MgCl2 was included in the same buffer for RNase V1 experiments. Before the addition of probing enzymes, the RNAs were denatured by heating at 70°C for 5 min followed by instant cooling on ice and brought back to 20°C for structural mapping. The following amounts of RNases were added for each reaction: 0.0088 (1000×)–0.044 (200×) μg RNase A (USB), 0.05–10 U RNase T1 (USB), 0.5–15 U RNase T2 (USB) and 0.01–01 U RNase V1 (Amersham Pharmacia). The hydrolysis RNA ladders were obtained by the incubation of RNA in the hydrolysis buffer at 85°C for 10 min and parallel RNA sequencing products were obtained by the treatment of unfolded RNA with RNases T1 and A. They were used as markers for the assignment of guanines and pyrimidines, respectively. All the reactions were incubated at 20°C for 10 min with the exception that RNase V1 was incubated for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by phenol–chloroform extraction, and precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried by vacuum. Finally, the cleavage products were loaded into a 10% denaturing gel with different running time to resolve different parts of RNA, and visualized by using phosphorimagery.In vitro transcription/translation and frameshift assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe T7-coupled transcription/translation (TNT) system (Progema) was used for the generation of the shifted and the non-shifted protein products according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each assay, a 25 μl reaction containing 500 ng of DNA template, 12.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate and 0.8 μl of 10 μCi 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30°C for 1.5 h. The samples were then resolved by 12% SDS–PAGE and exposed to PhosphorImager screen for quantification after drying. The frameshift efficiency was calculated by dividing the counts of the shifted product by sum of the counts for both shifted and non-shifted products, with correction of the methionine number in each product. Control experiments with the plasmids of 100–1000 ng produce similar results for frameshift efficiency (data not shown). For the generation of capped mRNA templates, the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Mammalian cell culture and luciferase assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSHuman embryonic kidney HEK-293T cells were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The transient expression was performed by LIPOFECTIN (Gibco BRL) transfection of 500 ng of reporter plasmids into 12-wells cultured cells. The cells were then assayed for the transient expression of the reporter gene 24 h after transfection using dual-luciferase assay of cell lysates, and normalized by β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. All the in vivo experiments were repeated three times with four to six assays for each reaction. Luciferase activity measurements for both in vitro reticulocyte lysate and in vivo transfected 293T cell lysates were performed by using the dual-luciferase™ reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions on an ABI TR 717 luminometer. Calculation of luciferase-based frameshift efficiency was performed with control plasmids to calibrate the ribosome drop-off effect as described previously (21).The −1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem–loop in loop 2 ::: RESULTSSequence alignment of the junction regions of ORF 1ab of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses indicated the existence of conserved UUUAAAC slippery site followed by a stretch of viral RNA sequences with the potential to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot (Figure 1). This region of the SARS CoV RNA genome, SARS13 369–13 520 (for residues 13 369–13 520) was thus cloned into p2luc vector to examine its −1 frameshifting activity (21). To faithfully monitor frameshift efficiency, we also arranged the terminus of the viral sequences under investigation to keep the TAA sequences in the N-terminal part of firefly luciferase ORF in frame to act as a stop codon in the presence of −1 frameshifting. This leads to premature termination of the frameshifted product and, thus, prevents the underestimation of frameshift efficiency because this manipulation can minimize the ribosome drop-off effect while translating the full-length firefly ORF (21). A different vector, pRL-SV40 was also used as the second reporter. Frameshift assay using either of the reporters indicated that the selected viral RNA sequences possess a frameshift efficiency of 60% (data not shown), which suggests that the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA contains an efficient −1 frameshifting stimulator in vitro.The −1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem–loop in loop 2 ::: RESULTSFurther examination of sequence contents of the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA revealed a potential stem–loop structure within the loop 2 region of this IBV-type pseudoknot. Furthermore, their primary sequences were found to be conserved among isolated SARS CoV sequences, and similar stem–loop structures were also identified in the loop 2 region of bovine coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus pseudoknot (Figure 1). To confirm the existence of the predicted atypical pseudoknot, enzymatic structure probing experiments were performed on SARS13 377–13 475 RNA and some of the results are shown in Figure 2A. As can be seen, the distribution of cleavage patterns for ribonuclease probes sensitive to single-strand region (such as RNase T2, T1 and A in lanes 7–12 of Figure 2A) is in agreement with the existence of loop regions, whereas the cleavage pattern by RNase V1 (lanes 5 and 6) that prefers cutting of duplex and stacked conformations can be localized to the three predicted stem regions (S1, S2 and S3). However, co-existence of cleavage by both RNase V1 and single-strand sensitive probes can be found for nucleotides localized to the junction region between S2 and S3. This is probably caused by a dynamic conformational equilibrium in this region as non-denaturing gel analysis suggests that the SARS13 377–13 475 RNA adopts a single conformation (data not shown). Nevertheless, these probing data are consistent with the existence of a stem conformation within the loop 2 in this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot as summarized in Figure 2B. Recently, the same S3 conformation has also been proposed and verified independently (23,24).The −1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem–loop in loop 2 ::: RESULTSDisruption of the base pairing region in S3 of an atypical pseudoknot impairs −1 frameshifting stimulation activity of the SARS13 369–13 520 RNA. To define the contribution of different stem regions of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot in the stimulation of −1 frameshifting activity, we mutated those nucleotides mapped onto form the duplex conformations. Mutants expected to disrupt a stem and those expect to reform the stem by compensatory base changes were then measured for their efficiency in promoting −1 frameshifting in vitro (Figure 3A). As shown in lanes 1–3 of Figure 3B, frameshift efficiency drops from 60% for wild-type construct to <1% for both 5′ and 3′ mutants that prevent the formation of base pairing in S1. In contrast, frameshift efficiency for the mutant with compensatory base changes to restore the base pairing scheme in S1 (lane 2 of Figure 3C) rises back to the wild-type level (55%). Similar results are observed for S2 with mutants destroying or reforming base pairs in the mapped duplex region (lanes 4 and 5 of Figure 3B and Lane 3 of Figure 3C). These experiments complement structural mapping data and strongly support the idea that it is the formation of the two typical H-type pseudoknot stems, S1 and S2, and not their sequence identities are required for efficient −1 frameshifting stimulation.The −1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem–loop in loop 2 ::: RESULTSInterestingly, lower sensitivity to base pairing disruption is observed for mutants located in the mapped S3 region. Mutants with disruption of base pairing in the upper or and in the lower stem region of S3 both led to a substantial decrease in frameshift efficiency when compared with the wild-type construct (from 60 to 36 or 37%, respectively, in lanes 6 and 7 of Figure 3B). However, restoring the base pairing scheme in either portion by compensatory base changes restored frameshift efficiency to the wild-type level including the up-restoration mutant that even displays a completely different sequence composition (lanes 4 and 5 in Figure 3C), suggesting that the formation of base pairing and not the sequence contents in S3 is involved in the efficient frameshifting activity of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot. Intriguingly, frameshift efficiency does not reduce further when more bases were mutated to disrupt all the potential base pair in S3 (lanes 8 and 9 of Figure 3B), implicating the existence of a residual frameshift activity for the remaining pseudoknot scaffold. Furthermore, a pseudoknot mutant lacking the S3 but harboring an 8 nt loop 2 possesses a frameshift efficiency of 53% (lane 10 in Figure 3B). As the topology and activity of this mutant are similar to those of the minimal IBV pseudoknot that lacks 75% of its wild-type loop 2 sequences (25), which indicates that S3 is not absolutely required for high frameshift efficiency. To rule out the possibility that the observed frameshift efficiency variation in S3 mutants is the outcome of their differences in ribosome loading efficiency of uncapped mRNA templates, separately transcribed capped mRNAs were also used to examine their in vitro frameshift efficiency as shown in Figure 3D. The data confirm the result from transcription-coupled translation approach used above, although lower frameshift efficiency for the wild-type construct is observed. Together, these data suggest that the roles of S3 in −1 frameshifting stimulation may be different from those of S1 to S2.Viral RNA sequences upstream of the slippery site can downregulate −1 frameshift efficiency in vitro ::: RESULTSRecently, analysis of a SARS CoV viral RNA genome containing a longer viral construct has revealed a very different frameshift efficiency from those observed in this work (26). To resolve this issue, we constructed a series of longer viral RNA-containing reporters with stepwise extension of viral insert in the 5′ direction upstream of the slippery site and measured their frameshift efficiencies. As shown in Figure 4A, frameshift efficiency of these viral RNA constructs are all lower than that of the shorter SARS13 369–13 520 RNA construct. Analysis of these data suggested that the proximal 150 nt region upstream of the slippery site, that is, the sequences 13 222–13 368 possess most of the observed downregulation effect because addition of the other 475 nt further upstream of it (the sequences 13 222–12 748) only lead to a 2% decrease in frameshift efficiency (compare lane 7 with lane 3 of Figure 4A). Together, it argues that the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA may possess a signal for the attenuation of −1 frameshift efficiency.Viral RNA sequences upstream of the slippery site can downregulate −1 frameshift efficiency in vitro ::: RESULTSTo confirm that the decrease in frameshift efficiency is contributed by the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA sequence, a reporter containing a large viral insert but lacking the potential attenuation signal (sequences 13 222–13 368), SARS12 748–13 368 Δatt was constructed. This construct possesses a frameshift efficiency of 55% although much longer protein is translated upstream of the slippery site and, thus, confirming the attenuation activity of the removed domain (compare lanes 2–4 of Figure 4B). Furthermore, the downregulation effect almost disappears for a chimera construct that has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator, arguing that this attenuation signal need to be positioned upstream of the slippery site to execute its function in vitro (lane 5 of Figure 4B). To examine whether the observed downregulation effect is mediated by polypeptide encoded by the viral RNA or by the RNA itself, an ORF-shifted mutant was generated and tested for its attenuation activity. In this construct, an A residue and two U residues are separately inserted into three different positions of the SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA to shift the reading frame, and consequently change the identity for 43 of the 50 amino acids encoded by the wild-type viral RNA sequences (Figure 5A). The result in Figure 5A indicates similar downregulation effect for this construct when compared with the wild-type construct. Taken together, these data provide strong evidences that the upstream RNA itself as well as its orientation to the slippery site are crucial for the cis downregulation effect of −1 frameshift efficiency in vitro, and the most stable structure of SARS13 222–13 368 RNA predicted by RNA structure version 4.11 (27) is presented in Figure 5B with a calculated free energy of −37.7 kcal/mol.Downregulation effect of the attenuation signal is general in vitro and also active in vivo ::: RESULTSWe also evaluated the generality of downregulation effect of this attenuation signal towards other −1 frameshifting stimulators by placing it upstream of the minimal RNA pseudoknot from IBV and MMTV, respectively (25,28) (Figure 6A). Results show this upstream attenuation sequence also downregulates −1 frameshifting promoted by RNA stimulator derived from IBV and MMTV (compare lanes 2–5 of Figure 6A). However, a weaker downregulation effect is observed when the attenuation signal is coupled to the minimal MMTV pseudoknot comparing with the minimal IBV pseudoknot. Therefore, the attenuation effect of this upstream signal can vary with the identity of the downstream stimulator. Finally, capped mRNA templates with or without the attenuation signal for the minimal IBV construct used above as well as a SARS viral construct carrying residues 12 265–13 652 and lacking any luciferase-related segment were also created to analyze their in vitro frameshift efficiencies. The results shown in Figure 6B reveal parallel results with the previous study in Figures 4A and 6A, and further rule out the involvement of ribosome loading difference in the observed attenuation effect. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such attenuation activity is not an artifact caused by the reporter system used because the inhibitory effect also functions within an all-viral context (compare lanes 2 with 3 of Figure 6B).Downregulation effect of the attenuation signal is general in vitro and also active in vivo ::: RESULTSTo evaluate the biological significance of this attenuation signal in the regulation of −1 frameshifting, we constructed several p2luc-based reporters for inserts possessing or lacking SARS13 222–13 368 viral RNA without shifting the stop codon located before firefly luciferase ORF to utilize the dual-luciferase activity to monitor frameshift efficiency in vivo (21). The in vitro frameshift efficiency of these constructs were calculated from dual-luciferase assay result of the TNT products of both plasmids (lane 1 in Figure 6C), and reveals parallel results with the frameshift efficiency reported above (lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 4A). Similarly, calculation from the in vivo dual-luciferase assay result for cells transfected with the reporter constructs indicates that the frameshift efficiency reduces almost in half in the presence of attenuation signal comparing with the one lacking the attenuation signal (lane 2 in Figure 6C). Thus, this upstream attenuation signal also functions in vivo.Manipulation of loop 2 conformation can modulate the −1 frameshift efficiency of IBV-type pseudoknot ::: DISCUSSIONThe pseudoknot of short S1 with a bent helical junction such as the one in MMTV and the IBV-type pseudoknot of long S1 with a stringent length-requirement of 11 bp represent two distinct classes of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (25,28–30). In either case, the ability to resist deformation by the translocating ribosome is thought to determine the frameshift efficiency stimulated by a specific pseudoknot (8,11,13,31). Alternatively, optimal contacts between the activity in ribosome and the stimulator for its efficient unwinding may also play roles in pseudoknot-stimulated −1 frameshifting (32). The impairment of −1 frameshifting for mutants with the disruption of S1 or S2 in SARS CoV pseudoknot can be rationalized by the formation of two separated hairpins and the coupled destruction of pseudoknot configuration. In contrast, disruption of the base pair in S3 is expected to be less important as the long loop 2 of the IBV-type pseudoknot has been thought to play a connection role to link the two stems (25). This is consistent with the wild-type like frameshift efficiency for the mutant lacking S3 in this study. Interestingly, the minimal IBV pseudoknot lacking most of its wild-type loop 2 sequences promotes −1 frameshifting better than its wild-type counterpart (10,25), whereas reverse trend is observed here for similar study on the SARS CoV pseudoknot. However, the medium frameshift efficiency for the two IBV-type mutants generated by complete base pairing disruption of S3 in SARS CoV pseudoknot suggest that the integrity of these base pairs in S3 may contribute extra −1 frameshifting activity in a delicate manner. We also note that existences of two extra base pair in the up-restoration mutants does not further enhance frameshift efficiency, implicating only a threshold value of stability is required. Taken together, they indicate that different secondary structure compositions within the loop 2 of IBV-type pseudoknot may modulate the frameshift efficiency of this type of pseudoknot, and implicate that the frameshift efficiency might be tunable by modulation of the S3 formation in vivo. Alternatively, the formation of S3 may also serve to prevent formation of unfavorable conformations that may interfere with frameshifting process as the long loop 2 could be merely constraint imposed by the encoded amino acids required for the RdRp activity.Manipulation of loop 2 conformation can modulate the −1 frameshift efficiency of IBV-type pseudoknot ::: DISCUSSIONThe atypical pseudoknot found in this work is different from those in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and HCV 229E, which also contain an additional stem essential for −1 frameshifting (33,34). The additional stem of 229E pseudoknot is formed by complementary sequences between the very long loop 2 and the 3′ end sequences following stem 2, and is probably stacked onto stem 2 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 24–25 bp. In contrast, the S3 of SARS CoV pseudoknot could stack into the bottom of S1 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 25–26 bp interrupted by two separated A-bulges. Although our mapping data cannot provide information about stacking configuration among these stems in the SARS CoV pseudoknot, helical junction geometry between S1 and S2 obviously will be coupled to the positioning of S3. As modulation of frameshift efficiency by the modification of junction geometry via tertiary interactions has been observed in helical junction of BWYV pseudoknot (35,36), the modulation of helical junction configuration by the additional S3 in SARS CoV pseudoknot could also play an important role here. Furthermore, the existence of single-strand cutter cleavage for residues connecting S2 and S3 in probing data also suggests a dynamic nature of the junction region. Therefore, reduced frameshift efficiency in mutants potentially disrupting partial or all of the base pair in S3 can thus be caused by changes in junction geometry with the weakening or diminishing of S3 in these mutants.Upstream attenuation sequence is a novel determinant for −1 frameshifting ::: DISCUSSIONThe significant decrease in −1 frameshift efficiency by upstream attenuation signal appears unexpected as the major viral factors characterized to determine frameshift efficiency all involve sequences between the slippery site and the downstream stimulator. Interestingly, recent works on HIV-1 and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) both reported the involvement of sequences upstream of the slippery site in modulation of overall −1 frameshift efficiency (37,38). However, only short sequences immediately upstream of the slippery site are involved in the case of HIV-1, and the modulation can go either way for enhancement or attenuation without a defined activity (37). In contrast, a conserved hairpin upstream of the slippery site was proposed to slow down the marching ribosome and thus enhance −1 frameshift efficiency in the case of BYDV (38). Recently, mutational study on the nucleotide adjacent to the slippery site of the SARS CoV also reported an increment of −1 frameshift efficiency in vivo (24). Our finding is thus unique in which, it specifies an RNA element of negatively regulatory activity with general application, and suggest that it is an integral part for the −1 frameshift efficiency determinant of SARS CoV although it is separated from the slippery site with an intervenient spacer. Although sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction for both SARS13 222–13 368 and SARS13 318–13 368 RNA with the corresponding regions of other coronavirues reveal no strong consensus, the sequences of SARS13 318–13 368 RNA do conserve among different strains of SARS CoV (data not shown). The existence of such an attenuation signal may provide the virus a regulation point for the tuning of RdRp synthesis in response to environmental changes. In contrast, a change in spacer sequence identity will lead to a fixed frameshift efficiency although it also reduced the efficiency. Furthermore, it may also change the property of the encoded amino acid composition in the N-terminal region of RdRp with dramatic impacts on the activity of RdRp.Upstream attenuation sequence is a novel determinant for −1 frameshifting ::: DISCUSSIONWith respect to the mechanisms responsible for the function of this negative determinant of −1 frameshifting, the factors known to affect frameshift efficiency should be examined in the future. However, it is less possible that it is mediated by the encoded polypeptide because 14 out of 18 amino acids encoded within SARS13 318–13 368 RNA were changed in the out of frame mutant and no dramatic change in attenuation activity has been observed. In contrast, it is more likely that the attenuation signal can contact with and affect the factors capable of modulating the frameshift efficiency. Indeed, interferences of dynamic interactions/contacts between pseudoknot and the ribosome or auxiliary factors in mutants of BWYV pseudoknot have been proposed to be responsible for observed frameshift efficiency variation comparing with that of its wild-type counterpart (36). However, it is tempting to speculate that the function of this attenuation element may be related to the extra S3 of downstream atypical pseudoknot. However, the fact that the attenuation signal also downregulates −1 frameshifting promoted by other stimulators suggests its function is general. Furthermore, the requirement for an orientation upstream of the slippery site and the stimulator in vitro indicates that function of the attenuation signal is probably not mediated via interactions with the downstream determinants of −1 frameshifting. Further biochemical analysis of the attenuation element will be informative for revealing how it works and providing insight of the mechanism of −1 ribosomal frameshifting."
Information theory-based algorithm for in silico prediction of PCR products with whole genomic sequences as templates,"PCR technique is widely used in the molecular biology laboratory. The key step to successful PCR is primer design. Usually, software for PCR primer design only gives a subset of candidates, and we must choose the workable primers empirically. With more organisms' genomes sequenced and data freely available, we may predict PCR products with computer programs and evaluate primer candidates against the target organisms' genomic sequence prior to performing the PCR in the laboratory.BackgroundThe most important thing for PCR product prediction is finding appropriate primer annealing sites on the template. Many attempts have been made to develop computer programs based on different algorithms for this purpose. Such programs include Amplify [1], simPCR [2], PCRAna [3], PUNS, and Virtual PCR [4]. PUNS [5] is a web-based program for PCR prediction, however, it does not deal with degenerate PCR primer. Some algorithms for the selection of probes or DNA oligos are also related to this field, such as longest common factor approach proposed by Rahmann [6], hybridization free energy based method used by Li [7], Kaderali's work [8] based on an extended nearest neighbor model, and Lexa's PRIMEX [9].BackgroundIn our research, we designed a new algorithm based on information theory. One information source was obtained by converting the primer sequences to numeric vectors of the potential full hydrogen bond numbers, and the second was created as a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed between the primer and its potential binding site on the template. An information coefficient was computed for determining the similarity between the two information sources as a criterion to locate primer-annealing sites, and predict products. A computer program, SPCR (Simulated PCR), based on this algorithm was developed to predict PCR products, and its performance was evaluated by replicating 4 cases of laboratory PCR experiments in silico, and performing comparisons between the predicting results of our program and VPCR.ImplementationThe algorithm is based on base digitalization followed by calculation of information coefficient. Information coefficient we used in this research is a formula based on Shannon's information theory. Shannon's information theory was ever used in other research concerned on primer design, e.g. Purohit et al. [10] used entropy measure to identify conserved regions in aligned sequences for primer design.ImplementationThe first step of this algorithm is to find out appropriate annealing sites from template sequences. Firstly, let the upstream and downstream primer sequences slide along template sequences respectively, one base per step. At each position where 3'-end base of primers match with the base of templates, a DNA fragment can be acquired from template sequences which length is the same as primer length, which we name as Candidates of Annealing Sites (CAS). The primer sequences and CAS fragments are all converted into numeric vectors. We name the numeric vectors of two primer sequences as PU and PD, and fragments of template as TU and TD. They are defined as below.ImplementationPU = [p1, p2,..., pm], PD = [p1, p2,..., pn]     (1)ImplementationTU = [t1, t2,..., tm], TD = [t1, t2,..., tn]     (2)ImplementationVariables m and n are lengths of upstream and downstream primers. The pi and ti are defined as below.ImplementationImplementationImplementationAccording to equation (1), (2), (3) and (4), we can transform the DNA sequences of primers and CASs into numeric vectors. Then we can perform the next step, computing the information coefficient (I) for each primer-CAS pair. The formula for the calculation of information coefficient (I) is as equation (5).ImplementationOnly those sites where the similarity is higher than a preset threshold were selected as annealing sites if the last digit in the vector of T was not 0 (a requirement for perfect match at the 3'-end).ImplementationThe formula for information coefficient (I) calculation is as follows:ImplementationImplementationHere ImplementationThe value field of information coefficient (I) is (0,1], when primer sequence match with template completely, i.e. P = T, I = 1, and the higher the affinity between primer and template, the greater the value of information coefficient. Information coefficients formed by upstream primer and CAS of template are represented as a set Iup; and accordingly, information coefficients of downstream primer and CAS are Idn.ImplementationFor each probable product, a successful amplification was determined by 5 parameters: upstream information coefficient Iup, downstream information coefficient Idn, estimated limits for product maximum and minimum length, and product amplification coefficient (Pa) which equals to an average of Iup and Idn. There are two kinds of average methods provided in SPCR program, the arithmetic average, i.e. (Iup+Idn)/2, and the geometric average, (Iup*Idn). We discuss only the geometric average here. Although the two method of average are different in computation, the values are close, and will not change the result of prediction significantly. If, and only if, the values of Iup, Idn, and Pa are all greater than the preset thresholds, and the length of predicted product lies in the preset length limit, did SPCR generate a product between upstream and downstream primer annealing sites within the product length range.ImplementationSPCR was implemented as a Win32 application and written in C++ language. It comprises an executable program that can be run directly without the need for installation. The user inputs the primer sequences, sets the thresholds, and provides locally one or more template sequence files, and push the button ""Start PCR"" to begin the prediction. SPCR can recognize degenerate primers encoded with the IUPAC nucleotide codes. Degenerated base are allowed in primer sequences. Template sequences can be available genomic sequence of the target organism, which must be Single- or Multi-FASTA format. The output of SPCR is a text file of a list of all predicted PCR products.ImplementationSPCR saves all produced data, including predicted products and all parameters, into a user-specified result file in pure text format. The output file consists of four parts. The first part is a table in which all of predicted products are listed, including their Pa value, product length, template it comes from, direction of amplification, position of beginning and end, Iup and Idn value, and the upstream and downstream primer sequences. The second part is a digit indicating the number of predicted products. The third part is the detailed nucleotide sequence data in FASTA format of all predicted products in the same order as in the table. The last part includes all parameters set before SPCR running. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the aggregate length of all the template sequences. In addition, SPCR provides a function to simulate agarose gel patterns of output data.ResultsTo test the performance of the SPCR program, we first used SPCR to simulate the PCR experiments presented in the Virtual PCR (VPCR) paper [4].ResultsThe SPCR prediction results for ARR5 and ARR7 genes were identical to the laboratory PCR results, and no unspecific products were produced (Fig. 1). VPCR gave one unspecific product for the ARR7 gene and 8 unspecific products for ARR5. The SPCR prediction for GEN12 and GEN13 families with degenerate primers gave a predicted agarose profile similar to the laboratory results. More than 80% of the predicted products had counterparts in the laboratory PCR results. VPCR predicted only 2 products for each of the gene families and gave more than 8 unspecific products in each case. Although Lexa et al. has released the 2.0 version of VPCR , the predictions of GEN12 and GEN13 are still not as accurate as SPCR.ResultsWe used the universal primer pair P0 and P6 [11] to predict 16S rRNA genes from 59 completed bacterial genomes. We correctly located all copies of 16S rRNA genes from 52 of the tested genomes with all threshold parameters at 0.85. Predictions for three strains yielded 1 or 2 unspecific products, which were eliminated when the threshold parameters were increased to 0.86 or 0.9. Discrepancies between SPCR prediction and GenBank data for three strains were found to be a result of incorrect annotation of the data. In only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene copy.ResultsSOX proteins contain a conserved HMG-related DNA binding domain, which shares at least 50% identity with that of SRY. Cremazy [12] designed a pair of highly degenerate primers, which were capable of amplifying a broad spectrum of SOX HMG sequences. We predicted SOX HMG sequences from Homo sapiens genome with the primer pair P5-2 and P3-1 and verified with the BLAST (blastn) program [13] that the top 10 products were all known SOX genes.ResultsTwo primer pairs for amplification of conserved regions in polymerase coronavirus genes were used to predict PCR products from 7 complete coronavirus genomes, including SARS-CoV and 14 other coronavirus species. All predictions yielded the expected products from all templates, 453 bp for primer pair IN-2(+)/IN-4(-) [14] and 251 bp for 2 Bp/4Bm [15]. Phylogenetic trees based on the predicted products were in agreement with the current taxonomy of coronaviruses.ResultsBesides above cases, we also tested SPCR with successful prediction of primer pairs for genome-specific amplification of environmental bacteria. Unspecific PCR primers against bacterial genomes for random amplification of bacterial community samples also yielded satisfactory results.ResultsThe threshold value of 3 parameters Iup, Idn and Pa are selected empirically. Increase of the parameter values can lead to reduction of unspecific products. This corresponds to increase of annealing temperature for reducing unspecific products in actual PCR. Usually, the 3 parameters should be greater than 0.8, if a specific PCR is predicted. If parameters higher than 9.0 still give unspecific products we suggest change of primer pairs if specificity is a major concern.DiscussionAmplification of non-targeted products is a common problem in PCR experiments, especially when using complex templates, such as whole genomic DNA or mixtures of genomes. It has been suggested that mismatch tolerance during primer annealing to template is the most important reason for unspecific PCR products, followed by primer length, template size, and product size limits [2]. The current PCR prediction methods are mainly based on probabilistic theories for similarity analysis between primer and template, while some other methods are also used in this field, such as statistical thermodynamics [16] and string comparisons.DiscussionA successful computer program for PCR product prediction should be able to identify all potential annealing sites. Sequence similarity between primer and template is the primary factor for selecting annealing sites. In this work we developed a new algorithm to assess the similarity between primer and template after the base sequences were converted into vectors of hydrogen bond numbers. We consider annealing of primer to template a means of information transfer. The hydrogen bond number vector for the primer is the source information, while the vector for template is the target information. The difference between the two information sources is a reflection of the fidelity of this information transfer process. Since hydrogen bonds are formed as a result of specific base recognition between the two DNA strands and the total number of hydrogen bonds is also a major force holding the two strands together, the similarity between these two information sources may be a good estimate of the probability of both annealing site selection and annealed structure stability. The information coefficient calculated in this work is a measure of similarity between two information sources. The value varies between 0–1, reflecting complete difference to 100% identity. In the SPCR program, the threshold can be increased to reduce expected products, which is comparable to increasing annealing temperature to reduce unspecific products in laboratory PCR. In contrast to BLAST, this algorithm tolerates any type of mismatch between primer and template. The successful prediction of all copies of 16S rRNA genes in complete genomes demonstrates the potential of using this algorithm for gene prediction of newly sequenced genomes.ConclusionIn our evaluating cases, the SPCR program is reasonably good for predicting all potential PCR products with complex templates. This can help the user choose the primer pair that gives the least possible non-targeted products. However, the prediction for random PCR products with SPCR is not satisfactory. When the template is too big, as the case with the human genome, the running time can reach 48 hours.ConclusionIn current version, SPCR do not consider the situation of insertions and deletions of template sequences, these situations should be considered in future versions.

Genetic lesions within the 3a gene of SARS-CoV," FindingsNumerous isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been completely sequenced [1-4]. In most cases, only synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions have been reported within the major viral genes, which include replicase 1a/1b gene products, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope [1-4]. On the other hand, large insertions or deletions have been found in the part of viral genome that encodes the SARS-CoV accessory proteins which have no viral homologues. The ORF 8a/8b region appears to be particularly prone to mutations as deletions of up to 415 bp have been observed in some isolates [2]. Although these mutations do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that these mutations may have effects on viral pathogenesis in vivo, as have been observed for other coronaviruses [5].Introduction ::: FindingsWe have previously reported that a frameshift mutation occurs within the 3a gene of culture-derived SARS-CoV, which results in a protein with a distinctively shorter N-terminus than the wild-type form [6]. Protein 3a is one of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins and the expression of the 3a protein has been demonstrated during both in vitro and in vivo infection [5]. To determine if the mutation arises from repeated passages of the virus or if the mutation exists in the virus that is replicating in SARS-CoV infected patients, we analyzed viral RNA isolated directly from 8 clinical samples and determined the sequence of the 3a gene. Interestingly, we have found evidence of a heterogeneous population of subgenomic RNA 3 (sgRNA3) transcripts in patients with acute SARS-CoV infection containing copies of wild-type and mutant 3a genes.The Study ::: FindingsTotal RNA was extracted from 8 patients confirmed with SARS-CoV infection, as defined by WHO guidelines. The use of clinical samples for this study was approved by the Tan Tock Seng Hospital ethics committee. Reverse transcription (RT, Superscript II RT, Invitrogen) was performed on all samples, according to the manufacturer's protocol, and was followed up by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR conditions and subsequent cloning steps have been described elsewhere [6]. Essentially, 15 independent clones from each of the eight SARS patient samples were sequenced. As a polymerase fidelity control of the RT and PCR system, full-length 3a RNA was in vitro transcribed from pXJ40-3a, a cDNA construct for expressing 3a in mammalian cells [6], and subjected to an identical follow-up PCR and cloning protocol.The Study ::: FindingsFor the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and Western blot analysis, Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with pXJmyc-GST, pXJmyc-3a or pXJmyc-3amut1 as previously described (3a and 3amut1 are also known as U274 and U274mut1, respectively, in ref. 6). All these constructs were tagged with the c-myc epitope at the N-terminus. All these experiments were performed as previously described [6].Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsWe have previously identified an oligo(T) tract within the 3a gene, located 16 bp after the first ATG initiation codon, which is prone to insertional mutations [6]. According to several analyses of about 100 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV isolates (in total) obtained from human and animal populations and that have been deposited with Genbank, there has been no report of mutations in this region [1-4]]. It is possible that direct sequencing results do not show this mutation if it is present in only a minority population. There was a previous report on a frameshift mutation in the 3a gene but the identity of this isolate was not mentioned [7]. The 3a gene from culture-derived SARS-CoV isolates contained heterogeneous extensions at this internal oligo(T) tract. The nature of this extension was such that up to three additional T's were added to the 6T's tract. Any change in the number of T's in this oligo(T) tract, other than in multiples of three, would result in a frameshift mutation and premature translation termination of 3a.Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsWe analyzed this region of the 3a gene from eight patients confirmed with SARS-CoV infection and have detected the presence of sgRNA3 transcripts, carrying 6T's to 10T's tract, in these patients (Figure 1). As our polymerase fidelity controls have confirmed that it is highly unlikely that sequencing and PCR errors are the source of these nucleotide aberrations (data not shown), and these results showed that different variants of the 3a gene exist in the viruses that were replicating in these patients. The percentage of the different mutant transcripts varied considerably from patient to patient. However, in 6 out of the 8 patients, more than 50 % of the sgRNA3 transcripts contains either 6T's or 9T's, which means that the full-length 3a (or with 1 additional amino acid) will be expressed. In patient D, less than 10 % of the transcripts are in-frame, while in patient E, none of the transcripts is in-frame, indicating that the full-length 3a protein will be expressed at a low level (Pat D) or not expressed at all (Pat E). In comparison, about 27 % of the transcripts from a culture-derived virus are in-frame [6]. Overall, these results showed that the frameshift mutations of the 3a gene are not specific to culture-derived SARS-CoV and that they point towards the existence of quasispecies within a given population of SARS-CoVs. As deduced from their study of sequence variation of the spike gene from viral isolates, another group has also suggested that SARS-CoV quasispecies exists in vivo [8].Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsTranslation of a frameshifted 3a gene would terminate shortly after 18 residues or so. Nonetheless, there are two alternative initiation codons located downstream. Translation from these would result in two possible smaller 3a gene products. We have shown that at least one of these truncated forms of 3a, named as 3amut1, can be detected in the lysate of infected cells [6]. It has been shown that the 3a is localized to the cell surface of SARS-CoV infected cells [6,9]. FACS analysis showed that while the myc-3a protein (full-length 3a with a c-myc epitope at the N-terminus) was transported to the cell surface in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells, the myc-3amut1 (truncated 3a with the same c-myc epitope) could not be detected on cell surface (Figure 2A). Western blot analysis was also performed to ensure that the expressions of the full-length and truncated 3a proteins in the transfected cells were comparable (Figure 2B). As 3amut1 corresponds to 101 to 274 amino acids of 3a and lacks the first two transmembrane domains [6], our results showed that these two transmembrane domains are essential for the expression of 3a on the cell surface.Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsIt is possible that the aberrant nature of the oligo(T) tract in the 3a gene is akin to that of the nucleotide insertion event in the oligo(A) tract of the 3b gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), another coronavirus [10]. The insertion of a single adenylate nucleotide into this region of 3b resulted in a C-terminally truncated gene product. The corresponding mutant 3b was also localized differently within the cell. In view of the fact that 3a has also been shown to interact with the spike protein [6,7] and that both proteins have a tendency to co-mutate [7], it would be interesting to know whether these serial frameshift mutations can also be correlated with a recognizable mutation pattern of the spike gene.Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsIn other RNA viruses, such as the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and human respiratory syncytial virus, internal poly(A) extensions have been identified before as a hot spot for mutations [11,12]. Similarly, these extensions also create frameshift mutations in the affected genes. FMDV populations with longer poly(A) extensions seem to have a lower fitness value as compared to those with shorter extensions [11]. This is despite the fact that both the wild-type and mutant forms of the affected FMDV protein, the L protease, have equal functionality [13]. In addition, viral genomes possessing different lengths of the poly(A) tract could be recognized even from just a single PFU of FMDV [11].Results and Conclusions ::: FindingsIt is intriguing to find that unlike 3a, the 3amut1 is not transported to the cell surface as the cell surface expression (and endocytotic properties) of 3a may be involved in modulating the trafficking properties of the spike protein [14]. Our results showed that the viruses in some of the patients appear to encode only for the truncated form(s) of 3a and not the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1) and indicated that the functionality of full-length 3a is not essential for virus replication. However, it is also conceivable that the different variants of 3a have different stabilities and/or functions, and hence would contribute differently to viral pathogenesis in vivo. In addition, it was recently reported that 3a is a structural protein and at least 2 truncated forms of 3a were dominantly present in the virion [9]. Further studies will reveal if the truncated forms of 3a, which results from frameshift mutations in the viral genome, can be incorporated in the virion and if there are phenotypic effects of a truncated 3a during the infection cycle. With respect to viral viability in the natural host, does full-length 3a confer a fitness gain over truncated 3a? If so, the possibility remains that under selective pressure, the distribution of viral genotypes could tip in favor to those which carry the wild-type 3a gene. A similar genotypic reversion event has been documented for FMDV [11]. Further studies on a larger cohort of patients will be necessary to establish if there is a relationship between the mutations observed in the 3a transcripts and the severity of the clinical symptoms in individual patients.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsTHPT carried out all experimental work and drafted the manuscript.

Conservation of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) N domains following independent expansions of the gene families in rodents and primates,"In tandemly repeated gene families, in which all members share a common function, there is a tendency for concerted evolution that is characterised by homogenisation of gene sequences [1]. Classical examples include the histone and ribosomal RNA genes. In such cases the expansion of gene families is driven by selection for high expression [2]. Concerted evolution is generally maintained by unequal crossover, intergenic gene conversion or other illegitimate recombination mechanisms [1,2]. Conversely, there are multigene families whose members encode diverse functions e.g. genes encoding immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins [1]. Such diversity occurs when there is less homogenisation than mutation, due to the evolution of specific programmed mutational mechanisms [3]. In addition, more complex modes exist; for example, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (VH) genes encode proteins with identical functions, but exhibit little concerted evolution [4]. Instead, their evolution is governed by divergence and a birth-and-death process of gene duplication and dysfunctioning mutations [2].BackgroundSimilar to other families of highly expressed trophoblast-specific genes such as the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) [5], the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, which are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during human late pregnancy, are encoded by multiple tandemly arrayed genes [6,7]. The PSG family of glycoproteins, with the related CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) proteins, are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily [8]. The Ig domain structure of the human and mouse PSGs differs, as follows: Human PSGs contain one V-like Ig domain (N), C2-like Ig domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C), with domain arrangements classified as type I (N-A1-A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C), type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [9]. In contrast, mouse PSGs typically have three or more N domains followed by a single A domain [7,10]. The common ancestor of rodent and primate PSGs and CEACAMs was probably similar to CEACAM1, which is the only CEA family member with an identical gene structure in the human, rat and mouse that encodes all types of extracellular domains present in CEACAM and PSG proteins. The time of initial gene duplication is estimated at 90 Myr [11], approximately the time of rodent-primate divergence. The independent expansion of human and mouse PSG gene families occurred through further gene duplication and exon shuffling events [7,12,13].BackgroundThe independent expansion of PSG gene families in rodents and primates indicates convergent evolution, implying that PSG function is conserved. These events can be interpreted in the context of evolutionary theories of parent-offspring and inter-sibling conflicts that promote transcriptional 'arms races' leading to high expression of trophoblast-specific genes that influence maternal investment in offspring [14,15]. In one scenario, duplicated PSG genes are selected because they increase effective PSG dosage, thereby enhancing an effect on maternal investment in offspring. In this context, it is noteworthy that human PSG N domains contain putative integrin-binding 'RGD' motifs that are proposed to mediate cell interactions with the extracellular matrix [16,17] and immune cells [18]. Such PSG-mediated functions could potentially influence trophoblast invasion or maternal immune cell function. However, not all human, and none of the mouse, PSGs contain an RGD motif [7], suggesting that, if human RGD motifs are functionally significant, there has been diversification of function of some human, and all mouse, PSGs, relative to a putative RGD-containing ancestor. In the context of parent-offspring conflict, such divergence might reflect co-evolution of PSGs and their receptors, similar to the co-evolution of ligand / receptor pairs observed in host-pathogen interactions [19,20].BackgroundIn this study, we sought to analyse PSG evolution to determine the extent and patterns of rodent and primate PSG sequence divergence by analysing intraspecific and interspecies DNA substitution rates in PSG coding regions. We also sought evidence in support of functionality of RGD and RGD-like tri-peptide motifs in PSG amino-terminal effector domains.Pairwise comparisons of all 4-domain mouse PSG with all 4-domain human PSG full-length amino acid sequences indicates conservation of the amino-terminal N domain ::: ResultsWith the exception of mouse PSG24, PSG30 and PSG31 and human PSG2 and PSG5, all PSGs for which full length sequences are available have a structure based on four Ig-like domains and a leader sequence that is cleaved during post-translational processing. The only type of domain found in all rodent and primate PSGs is the N domain located at the amino terminus. Indeed, this domain is shared by all members of the extended CEA family, suggesting that it may contain important functional motifs. We sought to test this hypothesis with respect to PSG function, by analysing both full-length PSG sequences and selected domains of possible functional importance. Alignments of full-length 4-domain human and mouse PSG protein sequences were generated with ClustalX, followed by pairwise comparisons of all mouse sequences with all human sequences. Mean Dayhoff PAM250 log scores were calculated for each alignment position and grouped by domain. The scores within each of the four domains were then visualised using box and whisker plots (which show the median value, upper and lower quartiles plus range) (Fig. 1). The N domains exhibited significantly higher scores (p < 0.001) than the other three domains, with positive scores indicating conservation. There was no evidence of interspecies conservation of the other domains, which is unsurprising given the known lack of orthology between human A1 / mouse N2, human A2 / mouse N3, and human B2 / mouse A domain pairs.Novel rat PSG N1 domains identified by database searches ::: ResultsRat N1 domain exon sequences were identified in NCBI and Ensembl databases. Three novel rat PSG genes were identified and named PSG41, PSG42 and PSG43 in keeping with accepted nomenclature [21]. We also identified a novel PSG40 splice variant with alternative leader and N1 domain exons, situated between the N1 and N2 domain exons of the published PSG40 sequence (NM_021677). Both BLAST and pattern matching methods retrieved the same rat PSG genes from different databases; therefore we considered our search to be exhaustive. All rat PSG genes were found to reside on contig NW_047556 and this was used for the prediction of remaining exons for each PSG gene based on BLAST generated alignments with mouse Psg gene sequences (Table 1). The CDS sequences of the novel predicted rat PSG genes and PSG40 splice variant are listed in additional file 1. We used our predicted sequences in preference to the publicly available sequences in our analyses.SplitsTree analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in rat PSG N1 domain alignments, compared to mouse ::: ResultsFollowing the preliminary identification of amino-terminal N domain conservation, we planned to use an evolutionary tree building approach to further examine inter-domain relationships in rodent and primate PSGs. However, using split decomposition analysis, McLenachan et al. [22], in their study of a subset of human PSGs, concluded that it is not possible to accurately determine branch points in an evolutionary tree of human PSGs. Split decomposition analysis identifies contradictory relationships within alignment data; for example, there may be a pattern grouping PSGX and PSGY together, and another pattern grouping PSGY and PSGZ together [23]. This information is normally approximated when drawing evolutionary trees, however split decomposition is a non-approximation method that permits the building of trees with support indicated for relationships based on all patterns in the data. Such analysis can therefore predict to a limited extent the occurrence of sequence homogenisation e.g. by gene conversion or positive selection.SplitsTree analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in rat PSG N1 domain alignments, compared to mouse ::: ResultsWe performed split decomposition analysis on nucleotide sequences using the SplitsTree4 program [24] on the individual domain exons of mouse Psg genes (Fig. 2). For a more complete analysis of N1 domains we also performed the analysis using rat N1 domain exons, all known human N1 domain exons and all known baboon N1 domain exons (Fig. 3). We detected no conflicting signals for mouse Psg N1 domain exons (Fig. 2A), in contrast to the human N domain exons (Fig. 2B). However, our results for human N1 domains (Fig. 3B) differ from those obtained by McLenachan et al. [22] because we observed only two contradictions: i. regarding the relationship of PSG4 and PSG9 to each other, and to their nearest neighbours PSG3 and the common ancestor of PSG6 and PSG10 and, ii. between 'the relationship of PSG2 to PSG1 and PSG11'. This discrepancy is probably due to our inclusion of four extra PSG N1 domain sequences, and the fact that the PSG11 sequence (GenBank: M69025) used by McLenachan et al. [22] has been updated.SplitsTree analysis reveals relatively high contradiction in rat PSG N1 domain alignments, compared to mouse ::: ResultsAnalysis of the mouse N2 domains indicates numerous contradictions in the alignments of the Psg24, Psg29, Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 group (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the N3 domains exhibit no discernable conflicts (Fig. 2C). The A domain only showed contradiction within the Psg24, Psg29, Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 group (Fig. 2D). Examination of the rat PSG N1 domain exon alignments demonstrated minor contradictions between the common ancestor of PSG36, PSG37 and PSG39 and that of PSG38 and PSG41 (Fig. 3A). In contrast to all the other PSG N1 domains thus compared, the baboon PSGs demonstrate considerable conflicting signals as demonstrated by the 'spider's web' appearance of the SplitsTree graph (Fig. 3C).Phylogenetic analysis indicates interspecific amino-terminal N domain conservation and identifies potential mouse / rat orthologues ::: ResultsFew examples of orthologous relationships between PSG sequences have been identified. In order to compare the relationship between rodent and primate amino-terminal N domain exon coding sequences, an NJ tree was produced (Fig. 4). The tree was generated from ClustalX alignments of nucleotide sequences, with bootstrapping 1000 times to test the reliability of branches. The human and baboon N sequences formed one distinct cluster, the mouse and rat N1 sequences formed a second, the mouse N2 domains formed a third and the mouse N3 domains formed a fourth. Of particular interest was the split between the ancestral N-type domain and the common ancestor of the N2 and N3 domains. The confidence of this split was 93% and demonstrates that the mouse N1 domains are more closely related to primate N domains than to the mouse N2 and N3 domains. A similar comparison of the entire set of mouse and human PSG domains confirmed that the interspecific N domain clustering is unique because the human PSG A1 and A2 domains segregated into distinct branches (sharing a common ancestor with the mouse A domains) and the B2 domains cluster on a distinct branch (Fig. 5).Phylogenetic analysis indicates interspecific amino-terminal N domain conservation and identifies potential mouse / rat orthologues ::: ResultsMouse and rat PSG gene coding sequences were analysed using an NJ plot which highlighted four putative orthologous relationships, as follows: rat PSG36 and mouse Psg24; rat PSG40 and mouse Psg29; rat PSG42 and mouse Psg32; rat PSG38 and mouse Psg16 (Fig. 6). There is also distinct branching of rat PSG43 with mouse Psg30 and Psg31. The orthologous relationship is also supported for PSG36 and Psg24 because both contain five N domains.PSG N domain sequences are generally conserved but alignments reveal specific regions that may be diverging ::: ResultsThe crystal structure of mouse CEACAM1 (soluble murine sCEACAM1a [1,4]) has been resolved [25]. Comparison of the mouse PSG N1 domains identifies the predicted β-sheet-forming CFG β-strands as the most variable regions of the N domains (Fig. 7A). The CFG face of CEACAM N domains has been shown to interact with pathogens and mammalian proteins (Fig. 7B). Within Box 1 and Box 2, there is considerable variation between mouse N1 domains, which is illustrated quantitatively using Dayhoff charts (Figs. 8 – 10). Positive Dayhoff scores and generally low standard deviations indicate good conservation of mouse PSG N1 domains (Fig. 8), and even stronger conservation of human PSG N domains (Fig. 9). The latter may be explained by homogenisation of human PSG gene sequences [22]. Dayhoff score analysis using comparisons of all mouse N1 domain versus all human N domain ClustalX aligned sequences gives an indication, at the amino acid level, of the general pattern of evolution of these domains since the rodent / primate divergence (Fig. 10). Again, the majority of residues exhibit good conservation, and relatively little variability is observed between pair-wise comparisons particularly with regard to residues that are involved in protein folding. The reduction in size of Box 2 in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10 is explained by deletions of mouse DNA sequences, requiring exclusion of the corresponding amino acids from the analysis.PSG N domain sequences are generally conserved but alignments reveal specific regions that may be diverging ::: ResultsTo gain further insight into mouse Psg N domain exon evolution, the N1, N2 and N3 domain exons of mouse Psg genes (mN1, mN2 and mN3, respectively), the N1 domain exons of rat PSG genes (rN1) and the N domain exons of human PSG genes (hN) were analysed in the following comparisons: mN1 vs mN2; mN1 vs mN3; mN2 vs mN3; mN1 vs rN1; mN1 vs hN. Synonymous (ds) and non-synonymous (dn) substitutions per synonymous and non-synonymous site, respectively, were determined in each case for all combinations of PSG gene pairwise comparisons, and box and whisker plots were generated from the data (Fig. 11). The majority of data points derived from individual comparisons lie under the 45° line of equivalence where dn = ds, and most variation in the comparisons lies within the values of ds (Fig. 11A). When the data are presented as box and whisker plots, the values are indicative of conservation, with median values ranging from 0.48 – 0.70 (Fig. 11B). The higher values for median dn/ds in the mN1 vs rN1 comparison appear to be the result of a tighter ds distribution as observed in Fig. 11A, with values not exceeding one substitution per synonymous site in any pairwise comparison.PSG N domain sequences are generally conserved but alignments reveal specific regions that may be diverging ::: ResultsIn view of the sequence variations in the CFG face, which are visible in alignments (Fig. 7A), against a background of overall conservation, as estimated from dn/ds analysis, we sought to determine whether the dn/ds values were higher in the CFG face than the ABED face of the N1 domain. Nucleotide sequence alignments were generated using all mouse Psg N1 domain exons (based on protein alignments), and the nucleotides present in the three sections comprising the CFG face (Boxes 1, 2 & 3; Fig. 7A) were separated from those comprising the ABED face. The two new sets of data were analysed individually to determine mean dn and ds values from pairwise comparisons of all sequences within each dataset (Fig. 12). A plot of dn vs ds for the ABED face of the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains (Fig. 12A) demonstrates a distribution of pairwise-alignment data points which overwhelmingly lie below the line of equivalence. However, a similar plot generated from analysis of the CFG face has data points distributed approximately equally on both sides of the line of equivalence (Fig. 12B). This is due predominately to a higher number of non-synonymous substitutions. The values of dn/ds obtained for the CFG face in the N1, N2 and N3 domains of the mouse and the N1 domain of the rat are all significantly greater than the values obtained for the ABED face (p < 0.0001, Fig. 12C). The dn/ds values obtained for the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domain CFG faces equal or exceed 1.0, with the highest median value of 1.1 observed in the N1 domain. The rat N1 domains are more conserved, with dn/ds values derived from both the CFG and ABED faces under 1.0 on average.Evidence of conservation of RGD-like motifs in mouse N1 domains ::: ResultsWithin Box 3 of the CFG face (Fig. 7A) there is evidence of conservation of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs in the mouse N1 domain, which may have functional significance. To investigate this possibility further, a survey of all mouse, rat, baboon and human PSG RGD, and related, motifs was compiled (Fig. 13). Extant primate and rodent PSG RGD-like motifs are linked in sequence space by an RGD motif encoded by the sequence CGA GGA GAT which, incidentally, is not observed in any of the extant PSG coding sequences. The most commonly observed motif, RGD, is encoded by CGA GGT GAT, and the majority of variants are closely related to this sequence. In rodents, RGE and HGE are the most commonly observed motifs. However, the NGK motif, which is not an RGD-like motif as we have defined it, is well represented, and is separated in sequence space from HGE by a transition and a transversion.Evidence of conservation of RGD-like motifs in mouse N1 domains ::: ResultsOf the seventeen aligned mouse PSG N1 domain exon sequences, 53% possess a tri-peptide at the site of the RGD-like motif belonging to the RGD-like 5-1-4 tri-group (as defined in the Methods section). For comparative purposes, tri-groups were determined for tri-peptide motifs at fifty random positions within the alignment. The number of most commonly represented tri-groups at each position was expressed as a percentage of the number of aligned sequences, and the mean and standard deviation was determined to indicate the mean maximal tri-group representation for the 50 random alignment positions. The control value obtained was 67.6 ± 22.9%; the value of 53% of 5-1-4 tri-groups at the RGD site therefore lies within the control range, albeit 14.6% below the mean value. However, a more revealing statistic is derived from aligning the mouse N1 domains with the mouse N2 and N3 domains (see additional file 2), compared to aligning the mouse N1 domains with the human N domains. In the former comparison (mouse N1 vs N2 and N3 domains) the most commonly represented tri-group is 4-2-5, with 27% representation. This tri-group is not RGD-like and its representation is lower than the mean maximal tri-group representation of 49.8 ± 22.7% determined for fifty random alignment positions. However, when the mouse N1 domain is aligned with the human N domain, the most commonly represented tri-group is the RGD-like 5-1-4 group which has 59% representation, comparable to the mean maximal tri-group representation of 60.7 ± 20.4%.DiscussionWe recently collated the full-length coding sequences of the entire mouse Psg gene family [7]. In the present study we aimed to identify evolutionary signals embedded in Psg gene and PSG protein sequences to determine whether PSG protein function has diverged between the rodent and primate lineages, and to attempt to understand the reasons for the independent expansions of rodent and primate PSG gene families.DiscussionMouse and human PSG protein amino-terminal N domains exhibit different patterns of evolution. McLenachan et al. [22] analysed the evolution of a subset of human PSGs using split decomposition analysis and found, in individual comparisons of N, A1, B2 and C domain exons, strong contradictions in alignments, which they suggested was due to gene conversion and/or positive selection. Our similar analysis of an expanded set of human PSG sequences revealed a detectable, but less marked, degree of homogenisation. Analysis of mouse N and A domain exons showed that, in general, there is less evidence of purifying selection compared to the human, although there are examples of gene conversions as described previously for the closely related Psg21 and Psg23 genes [12]. Detailed analysis of alignments using plots of Dayhoff scores confirmed the difference between mouse and human N domain evolution.DiscussionUsing dn/ds analysis for interspecies comparisons, we found that the PSG protein amino-terminal N and N1 domains are relatively conserved, consistent with conservation of function in rodents and primates. However, inspection of mouse PSG N1 domain alignments, and scrutiny of corresponding Dayhoff scores, revealed regions of apparently poor conservation. These regions correspond to the CFG face within the N1 domain of CEACAM1. In the CEACAM family, the CFG face interacts with pathogens and mammalian proteins. Comparisons of dn/ds values obtained from the CFG and ABED faces of mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains confirmed that the CFG face has evolved more rapidly than the ABED face in all three domains. The greatest effect was observed in the N1 domain exon with a doubling of the dn/ds ratio in the CFG face compared with the ABED face. The dn/ds ratio of 1.1 suggests weak positive selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain. The increase in the dn/ds ratio appears to be mainly due to an increase in the dn value, indicative of diversification. The high dn/ds values for the CFG face in the N2 and N3 domains, which are not known to interact with ligands, could be due to a low contribution of these sequences to the structural integrity of the IgV-like domain.DiscussionInterestingly, the rat N1 domain CFG face does not appear to have evolved as rapidly as the mouse N1 domain, with a dn/ds ratio of 0.9. This observation, combined with the relatively smaller number of PSG genes identified in the rat (eight to date, compared to seventeen in the mouse) and the higher level of gene homogenisation implied by split decomposition analysis suggests that the rat PSG gene family has not expanded or diversified as extensively as the mouse. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that further rat PSG genes may yet be identified because there may be under-representation in the WGS database [26]. Notwithstanding this possibility, there has clearly been ongoing turnover of the PSG gene family in all of the lineages analysed, as there are no known human orthologues of rat and mouse PSGs, and only four potential orthologous relationships between known rat and mouse PSGs.DiscussionThese findings suggest partial conservation of PSG N domain function across rodent and primate lineages. However, the relaxed constraint on the CFG face of mouse PSGs suggests diversification of binding partners or modification of existing ligand-binding kinetics, analogous to the CEACAMs. This observation receives experimental support from the recent observation that treatment of mouse macrophages in vitro with recombinant mouse PSG17N, or human PSG1 or PSG11, induces cytokine expression; however, only in the case of mouse PSG17N does this depend on CD9 receptor expression [27]. Divergence of PSG function is also suggested by differences in the level and developmental timing of expression of different mouse PSGs [7,12], expansion of N domain number in PSG24, PSG30 and PSG31 [7], and loss of secretory signals in PSG32 and in the brain-specific splice variant of PSG16.DiscussionAs noted above, the only PSG receptor identified to date is the integrin-associated tetraspanin, CD9, which binds the N1 domain of mouse PSG17 but not, apparently, to human PSGs [28]. However, a peptide containing the RGD motif from the human PSG9 N domain binds to a receptor on a promonocytic cell line suggesting that some human PSGs may effect their functions through an integrin-type receptor [18]. In this context, the high frequency of the RGD motif on an exposed loop in primate PSG N domains (seven of ten in human and five of fifteen in baboon) may be significant. Rodent PSG N1 domains do not have an RGD motif, but have a high frequency of the RGD-like motifs RGE, HGE and HAE on the CFG face. Under the null hypothesis that these motifs are unlikely to underpin structural integrity of the N1 domain and are therefore free of constraint, our analysis reveals evidence of unexpected conservation of RGD-like motifs in the N1 domain, which have been lost in the N2 and N3 domains. Given the high transition and transversion rates in the N1 domain and the fact that the mouse N1, N2 and N3 domains share a common ancestor after the divergence of the rodent / primate lineages, the conservation of RGD-like motifs exclusively in the N1 domain may have functional significance. We note that the RGE motif in the context of the POEM protein induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro [29]. We speculate that certain RGE or RGE-like motifs may elicit weak cell attachment, followed by apoptosis – a combination of properties, reminiscent of snake venom disintegrins [30,31], that could have important functional implications in the context of the extensive tissue remodelling that occurs during placentation [32].DiscussionIn summary, our data are consistent with experimental evidence indicating functional convergence of rodent and primate PSGs, in spite of the independent expansions of the gene families in the two lineages. In the context of parent-offspring conflict, the homogenisation of human PSG sequences is consistent with the theory that placental hormones encoded by multigene families are monofunctional and selected for high expression, possibly due to coevolution with physiologically conflicting maternal mechanisms [15]. However, the evidence for positive selection on the CFG face of the N1 domain implies divergent evolution of rodent PSGs. Allied to the evidence for functionality of putative integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs in rodents, a scenario can be envisaged whereby the different RGD-like motifs observed in human and baboon PSGs also suggest some degree of functional divergence in these species.ConclusionOur analysis provides evidence for conservation of rodent and primate PSG amino-terminal N domains, with ongoing independent expansion of the gene families in the two lineages. There has been some diversification of the CFG face of mouse N1 domains, a region that includes putative integrin-interacting RGD-like motifs. Our analysis provides reassurance that the mouse Psg gene family is a suitable model system for the analysis of human PSG gene function.Identification of novel rat PSG N1 domain exons ::: MethodsBlast searches of the NCBI [34] and Ensembl [35] RGSC3.1 rat genome databases were performed using coding sequences from known rat PSGs (PSG36-PSG40) and mouse PSGs. Additionally, a search pattern was developed and used to interrogate the Rattus_norvegicus.RGSC3.1.nov.dna_rm.contig.fa.gz archive obtained from the Ensembl FTP resource [36]. The search pattern was derived manually from alignments of amino acid sequences from the N domain exon of all known mouse and rat PSGs (mouse PSG16-PSG32 and rat PSG36-PSG40) generated using the ClustalX 1.81 windows interface [37]. In PROSITE format [38] the search pattern used was S-x-R-E-x(5)-G-x(3)-[IL]-x(3)-T-x(2)D-x(3)-Y-x(17,18)-L-x-V. Analysis was performed essentially as described [39], with the program modified to search for the selected pattern in peptides of fifty amino acids or greater derived from genomic DNA sequences translated in all six open reading frames. ClustalX alignments were produced using the complete open reading frames returned by the program combined with the N1 domains of rat PSG36-PSG40. The alignments were trimmed to include only N1 domain exon sequence and a Neighbour-Joining tree was generated using MEGA version 2.1 software [40] to aid the identification of the new sequences.Phylogenic analysis ::: MethodsMouse PSG sequences were obtained from McLellan et al. [41], rat PSG sequences were obtained as described above, human PSG sequences were obtained by name searches at the NCBI Entrez (nucleotide or protein options) database [42] and baboon N1 domain sequences were obtained as described [43]. To generate protein alignments for examination by eye, a Web based ClustalW utility was used [44], otherwise protein sequences were aligned with the ClustalX using the default parameters. Nucleotide alignments were generated based on ClustalX protein alignments, such that where a single dash was placed in the amino acid alignment, three dashes were placed in the equivalent codon position in the nucleotide alignment. The nucleotide alignments were then analysed using SplitsTree version 4b [24] and software and NJ trees were generated from the data (with bootstrapping 1000 times to test the reliability of branches). Individual domains of the mouse PSGs were also analysed by the split decomposition method using the same software. During NJ or Splitstree tree-building, the Jukes-Cantor [45] correction for multiple hits was applied and positions with gaps were ignored.Comparisons of amino acids encoded at each site within alignments ::: MethodsMultiple alignments of either one set (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 domain exons only) or two sets (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 and N2 domain exons) of amino acid sequences were produced using ClustalX. A Perl program was written to perform the subsequent analysis. At each position of the alignment, the Dayhoff PAM250 log score was determined for pairwise comparisons of each sequence in the set against all the others in the set in one-set analyses, or of all set 1 sequences against all set 2 sequences in two-set analyses. The mean and standard deviation of scores obtained for the pairwise comparisons at each site were determined to give an indication of the general level of conservation and variability at the site. Sites where gaps were present in any of the sequences were not analysed. Where full-length mouse and human PSG amino acid sequences were compared, the scores were split into five groups at domain junctions and a box and whisker plot produced.Evolutionary analysis ::: MethodsClustalX was used to produce multiple alignments of either one set of amino acid sequences (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 domain exons only) or two sets combined (e.g. all mouse PSG N1 and N2 domain exons). These alignments were used to inform the alignment of corresponding nucleotide sequences as described above. Values of ds and dn were determined for pairwise comparisons of each sequence in a set against all the others in the set for one-set analysis, or of all set 1 sequences against all set 2 sequences for two-set analysis. The analysis was performed according the method of Yang and Neilsen [46] using the 'YN00' program in the PAML3.14 software package [47]. Before each pairwise comparison was executed, pairs of aligned sequences were extracted from the alignment file, placed in a Phylip format file and gapped positions were removed. Plots of dn vs ds, and box and whisker plots of dn/ds were produced in order to visualise the data. Where statistical significance was evaluated, the Mann-Whitney test was applied.Analysis of tri-peptide amino acid property groupings ::: MethodsA perl program was written to analyse ClustalX alignments of mouse and human PSG N domain exons. These alignments were inspected and modified where necessary. For a tri-peptide at a given position within an alignment, a tri-group code was generated for tri-peptide motifs based on amino acid properties of the residues in the motif where group 1 contains G, A, S, T; group 2: V, L, I, M; group 3: F, Y, W; group 4: D, N, E, Q; group 5: H, K, R; group 6: P; group 7: C. For example, an RGD tri-peptide motif is represented by tri-group code 5-1-4 as arginine is in group 5, glycine is in group 1, and aspartate is in group 4. Conversely, tri-group 5-1-4 is 'RGD-like' in terms of the biochemical properties of the constituent amino acids. The number of sequences in the alignment containing each group code at a given position was determined. The most highly represented group code in the alignment at that position was used in the analysis. The program was designed to compare a user selected tri-peptide motif position with fifty randomly selected tri-peptide motif positions.Authors' contributionsA.

Identifying strategies to improve access to credible and relevant information for public health professionals: a qualitative study,"The need for improved access to high quality public health (PH) information has been echoed in various forums involving public health professionals, librarians, and information professionals since the mid 1990s [1-5]. The information needs of the PH workforce have become all the more urgent with the increasing frequency of emergence of new infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Asian bird flu, as well as the increasing concern about acts of bioterrorism, such as spreading anthrax spores via the US Postal Service in 2001.BackgroundA major difficulty in meeting these needs is the great breadth of the PH discipline which makes it difficult to identify and collect a body of evidence-based literature to address the growing multitude of specific PH information needs. The PH workforce may be more diverse than any other group of health professionals [6] and includes professionals trained in dozens of disciplines [3,5], ranging from environmental health to veterinary medicine, from sanitary engineering to epidemiology.BackgroundStudies of the information needs of PH professionals have addressed information seeking behaviors of PH workers, obstacles to information access, and defining and classifying the specific types of information needed. Reports of studies focusing on how PH workers look for the information they need note that many PH professionals have been slow to adopt electronic information-seeking behaviors, sometimes because of the time required for users to acquire the requisite skills and other times because access to electronic databases is not available [7-9]. Studies focusing on obstacles to electronic access to and use of evidence-based information in the PH field [1-3,5,10-13] have identified many relevant obstacles including: (1) limited awareness of the importance of evidence-based information to inform practice and lack of encouragement from opinion leaders to seek it; (2) limited awareness of what information is available electronically and from what sources; (3) limited access to computers, the Internet or email; (4) limited skills needed to access the information sources and lack of ease of use; (5) a diverse array of content needs requiring access to databases from many disciplines (and in other languages); (6) limited time to sift through the poorly filtered information that is returned by searches using sets of search terms inadequate for PH concerns; (7) limited ability of decision-makers to appraise the methodological quality of research; and (8) the paucity of systematic reviews of PH topics.BackgroundLynch [14] suggested that information accessing needs among PH professionals often focus on immediate problem-solving and not on answering open-ended academic research questions. Investigators focusing on the kinds of information needed by PH professionals [5,6,14] have noted the need for diverse kinds of information including the grey literature and unpublished studies, practice guidelines, research studies and systematic reviews. These investigators also point out the need for information that is effectively summarized and synthesized. There is also a need for linkages among multiple databases as well as providing access to databases related to best practices, outcome measures, statistical information, policy updates, and information that may be unique to a particular location or region. Nutbeam [4] has formalized a valuable four-level typology of increasingly informative levels of research knowledge in the PH field. Nutbeam's model does not, however, include grey literature that may be needed to assist PH decision makers when the evidence needed to inform urgent PH issues is incomplete.BackgroundAccess to evidence-based public health information has become a growing concern for medical librarians. In 1997, the National Library of Medicine along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies launched the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project to begin to address this concern. The Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health (EBPPH) Project at the Lamar Soutter Library of the University of Massachusetts Medical School was initiated in 2001. This Project initially focused on identifying resources available to clinical medical practitioners and PH practitioners for locating, summarizing, synthesizing and disseminating evidence-based information. It then compared resources available to clinical medical practitioners to those available to PH practitioners. We found that there were many more types of resources focused on clinical medical practice than on PH practice. The clinical medical resources were based on several different models of information search, summary, synthesis and delivery, and some of the most promising models had little or no presence in the PH arena.BackgroundTo explore and address this gap, the EBPPH project sought to examine and classify the features of the clinical evidence-based medicine resources, to assess their potential for improving access to the PH literature, and to develop new models that could effectively address the unique needs of PH professionals. EBPPH also works on identifying other existing projects aimed at synthesizing, summarizing or improving access to evidence-based PH information and publishes links to effective evidence-based resources it has identified via its website [15].BackgroundThis article presents the results from a qualitative study undertaken by the EBPPH project that combined three objectives that previous investigators had generally pursued individually: (1) characterization of information needs of PH practitioners, (2) identification of typical information seeking behaviors, and (3) assessment of barriers to information access. We have used the insights gained from the study to inform the construction of an extended classification of the types of information needed by PH professionals and of a hypothetical model for PH information access that could meet their needs for access to diverse credible sources.Operational definitions ::: MethodsJenicek [16] defines evidence-based public health practice as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of communities and populations in the domain of health protection, disease prevention, health promotion, and health maintenance and improvement. We too are using the term ""evidence-based"" to refer to the best available evidence that is both credible and of the highest known quality.Research process overview ::: MethodsThe research project team of four consisted of 1) the Lamar Soutter Library Director with a DA degree, 2) one of her staff members with an MPH degree (both had formal training in qualitative research techniques provided by the qualitative research consultant), 3) a medical consultant with an MD and expertise in medical informatics (quantitatively trained with prior experience working with the qualitative research consultant on other qualitative studies), and 4) a qualitative research consultant with a background in software development, a PhD in organizational and human development, and expertise in teaching and applying qualitative methods in a variety of studies related to medical and PH interventions. All four participated in the development of interview questions and the conduct of focus groups as well as reviewing the findings and developing the models.Research process overview ::: MethodsThe EBPPH research process was a seven-step process (See Figure 1). The first step was to identify and characterize existing information resources available to medical and PH professionals. The second step was to collect data on information accessing needs, behaviors, and barriers via individual interviews from one domain of PH practice, communicable disease control. Thirdly, after findings were analyzed, they were presented to a focus group of PH professionals previously interviewed along with examples of information accessing resources currently available to gather additional input on information accessing needs. In the fourth process step we used information gathered to revise the individual interview script and make it more specific for interviewees in a second, but related domain of PH practice – community health promotion. The fifth step involved analysis of this new data and construction of a preliminary hypothetical model with features to meet the information accessing needs identified by the participants. In step 6 an analysis of the findings from both domains, examples of existing resources, and the hypothetical model were reviewed in a focus group with Community Health Promotion staff previously interviewed. As a result of step 6, we revised the hypothetical model to reflect the feedback gathered in the last focus group.Research process overview ::: MethodsThe research protocol used for this study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, IRB Docket #H-10507.Recruiting process and sample selection ::: MethodsWe chose subjects for our study from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) because of ongoing relationships between investigators and MDPH employees and because of the proximity of the Department offices to the EBPPH project site. We focused on the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) and the Bureau of Family and Community Services' Community Health Promotion (CHP) groups because they are both relatively large groups and because these two groups were likely to represent a significant portion of the broad spectrum of information needs in PH in general. One group deals primarily with prevention and control of communicable diseases (BCDC) and the other with health promotion related to prevention and control of chronic disease (CHP).Recruiting process and sample selection ::: MethodsThe Director of each sample work group was asked to provide names of individuals in his/her group who most often needed access to information from multiple sources. Twelve potential interviewees were selected by the BCDC Director from the program areas of tuberculosis prevention and control; epidemiology and immunization; sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention and control; refugee and immigrant health; and library services. Eight potential interviewees from the CHP group were selected by their Director in the areas of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease prevention and control; nutrition and physical activity; and women's, men's and elder health. An email message was sent to each of those selected requesting agreement to participate and interviews were scheduled by either email or telephone. All twelve of the BCDC interviewees suggested participated in the individual interviews while seven of the eight approached from CHP participated. Seven of the BCDC informants (60%) participated in a follow-on focus group at a later time. Three CHP employees previously interviewed (43%) participated in the CHP follow-on focus group. The professionals in our sample ranged from information technologists, librarians, trainers and program directors to medical directors and division directors. Informants held various degrees in nursing, public health, medicine, veterinary medicine, and other specialties.Data collection ::: MethodsData were collected from the two sample groups first via 45-minute individual interviews with all participants. During later focus groups, lasting about an hour and a half, preliminary findings were reviewed and validated and additional data were collected as participants reacted to PowerPoint slides presented describing existing information sources and accessing features. A hypothetical model for PH information access was also presented at the second sample focus group for feedback. All individual and group interviews were audiotaped. Individual interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the qualitative research consultant listened to the focus group tapes and took notes of study participants' comments related to information accessing features presented as close to verbatim as possible.Analyzing data and validating coding ::: MethodsBased on a technique developed by LaPelle [17], we employed Microsoft Word to transcribe data into tables of text responses where coding and sorting of text segments can be done based on theme codes. Our thematic analysis approach rests heavily on the qualitative research techniques described by Crabtree and Miller [18-20], Miles and Huberman [21], and Patton [22]. Transcribed textual data from interviews were reviewed by the qualitative research consultant through a continuous process of comparing data segments to other data segments, looking for similar or repeated ideas to be conceptualized as themes. A continuously evolving codebook was developed defining themes identified in the interview script as well as subthemes as they emerged from repeated readings of the data. The transcripts in the Microsoft Word table structures were coded thematically in a table column adjacent to the relevant text segment using the preliminary draft of the codebook. Codebook development and coding were conducted solely by the qualitative research consultant. After sorting coded text segments via the Microsoft Word Table Sort function, coding validity was assured by reviewing the text that sorted into each code, correcting those that were miscoded and resorting. Some themes were further deconstructed creating additional subthemes after sorting when this seemed appropriate. Within-transcript analyses and data reduction were done, proceeding to cross-transcript analyses. A comparison table was constructed to compare summarized responses related to each significant theme across participants for each group. Subsequently findings were compared across groups. At each stage in the data analysis and reduction, findings were reviewed with other members of the project team. Additionally, findings were reviewed with participants from each sample at the focus groups for further validation.Step 1 – identification of existing information access resources and features ::: MethodsThe EBBPH medical consultant identified existing resources delivering information to medical practitioners and to PH professionals. These were advertised via mailings, email promotions, and vendor displays at academic meetings and identified in discussions with clinical and PH professionals who were intensive consumers of medical and PH information. He also performed informal Internet searches using Google. Through the use of trial and full subscriptions, the consultant informally explored the resources he identified and catalogued the features of these resources. The key access, formatting and content features these resources offered are listed in Table 1: (1) keywords for searching large collections of research reports and reviews, (2) pre-formulated search filters, (3) automatic notification (e.g. periodic emails to subscribers with information on recently published research reports), (4) abstracts or summaries of research reports sometimes associated with commentaries, (5) systematic reviews, (6) evidence-based guidelines, (7) comprehensive knowledge sources, (8) within article indexing with links that allows access to the specific information needed, and (9) archiving capabilities.Steps 2 and 3 – individual interview and focus group data collection for BCDC ::: MethodsThe individual interview script was developed by the project team. The BCDC script included questions about the types of work tasks informants performed that required access to information, currently used and preferred information sources, preferred format for research information, current barriers to information access, and desired enhancements for access [see Additional file 1]. Individual interviews with BCDC professionals were done in person at their workplace by the project's qualitative research consultant hoping to observe their electronic information accessing behavior where possible. Those who were very computer literate or had sizeable offices met with her in their offices and were comfortable demonstrating how they accessed their preferred electronic sources. However, many either had no space in their offices to hold the interview or accessed most of their information in ways that were not easy for us to observe. The individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the fall of 2003.Steps 2 and 3 – individual interview and focus group data collection for BCDC ::: MethodsA follow-on focus group was held in the spring of 2004. The focus group agenda for BCDC included reviewing a summary of findings from their interviews for validation followed by a PowerPoint presentation on several existing website examples of PH information organization and dissemination (see Table 1) to ascertain their familiarity and preference for specific features of these models. The focus group was conducted by project team members without a detailed script.Step 4 – initial data collection for CHP ::: MethodsThe individual interview script for CHP participants used the BCDC script as a basis but was modified by the project team to add more specific questions regarding listservs providing links to current information, systematic reviews and comprehensive knowledge bases based on inconclusive findings in these areas from interviews with the BCDC participants [see Additional file 2]. Individual interviews with CHP professionals were conducted by the project's qualitative research consultant by telephone since most in-person interviews with BCDC participants had not yielded opportunities to observe their information accessing behavior directly. The individual interviews with CHP informants took place in the summer and fall of 2004.Step 5 – hypothetical model development ::: MethodsFollowing the individual interviews with CHP informants, we developed a preliminary hypothetical model of information reformulation, organization and access based on our interpretation of CHP informants' responses to the interview questions and prior findings from the BCDC informants.Step 6 – focus group with CHP participants ::: MethodsThe focus group agenda for CHP included reviewing a comparison of findings from BCDC and CHP, validation of CHP findings and a review of existing information accessing website examples (see Table 1), followed by specific questions [see Additional file 3] about desirability of specific resource features. Additionally the hypothetical model that addressed most of the articulated needs was presented and additional questions were asked about the use of PubMed [23] as a foundation for implementing the model and how PubMed would need to be enhanced to evolve into an implementation of the hypothetical model. The focus group was conducted in the early spring of 2005 by project team members.Work context ::: ResultsProfessionals at MDPH have a wide variety of needs for information and varied significantly in their level of skill in accessing it. All MDPH staff we interviewed had desktop computers and access to the Internet. MDPH itself hosts a multi-faceted website that provides access both for employees and for the general public to programmatic information, statistical databases and MDPH documents. The main MDPH offices are located in multiple sites in the Boston area. The CHP group and the BCDC are located in different office buildings, each of which includes a small library staffed by part-time librarians offering document search and retrieval services. However, the urgency of information needs differed widely within and across programs, and use of external electronic information sources also differed widely due to variation in both need and skills.Tasks requiring external information access ::: ResultsThe nature of the work of the two groups also differs. BCDC is concerned with both established and emerging communicable diseases and needs fast-breaking news about emerging diseases such as SARS as well as evidence-based information about more established diseases like tuberculosis. CHP deals primarily with health promotion related to chronic diseases and is involved in working with external coalitions to develop statewide collaborative prevention and control plans for diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, there is also significant overlap in the information accessing needs of these two groups.Information needs and information-seeking behaviors ::: ResultsSix distinct categories of information emerged from the participants' statements about the kinds of information they required in their work: (1) early reports on newly identified health risks and preventive behaviors; (2) early reports on emerging practices and programs, usually descriptive in nature; (3) information on evaluated new interventions known to be effective; (4) syntheses of knowledge on established public health threats and practices as typically found in reference texts; (5) published research reports, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews as found in peer-reviewed journals, often based on formal research designs; and (6) evidence-based guidelines. [See Additional file 4 for informant quotes supporting these 6 categories of information needs.]Information needs and information-seeking behaviors ::: ResultsExamples of the kind of information currently accessed by the participants in each of the six categories and typical associated sources of information can be found in Table 2. Those we interviewed in their offices demonstrated how they accessed many of the source examples in Table 2, provided website information, or gave us sample copies of information available from these sources. The sources included websites, electronic automatic notifications often via listservs, journals, presentations at meetings, and personal communications. Websites and general search engines were commonly used to seek out the most relevant information. Email was a key means for receiving automatic notification via listservs and exchanging a variety of types of information. Existing listservs for PH professionals typically provide information from news sources and selected titles, abstracts, and links to recently published journal articles and other documents relevant to specific disciplines or diseases. A few informants who were less comfortable with Internet access to information still relied on hard copies of relevant journals that were circulated within their workgroup. The telephone and attendance at conferences provided other important means of accessing information, especially on emerging health threats and new PH practices.Limitations of existing mechanisms of information access ::: ResultsWe found that there were significant limitations on the available means of information access identified by participants that could be met by improving electronic access mechanisms. Stating that there were too many relevant websites to search them all effectively or regularly, both groups wanted one portal access to all categories of information via a good search engine. To address delays in becoming aware of important new information, they also wanted automatic notification of newly available information in areas specific to individual interests. They felt websites and automatic notification systems such as listservs were complimentary. Participants in both groups reported feeling bombarded with unfiltered, often duplicative information in emails and from participation in listservs with no way to screen out irrelevant information. They reported similar difficulties dealing with irrelevant and duplicative returns from searching websites because PH-specific keywords are not standardized or used effectively by search engines. Both groups expressed a need for better mechanisms for selecting and filtering information sought from listservs and via search engines.Limitations of existing mechanisms of information access ::: ResultsBoth groups noted limitations on access to information in selected PH sub-domains of interest. BCDC professionals noted information gaps in the areas of STDs and refugee and immigrant health. CHP professionals cited limitations on information in areas such as environmental links to cancer, elder health, legislative and policy change nationally and in other states, and newly identified health risks and healthy behaviors. CHP and BCDC informants identified problems in accessing relevant information from related domains outside of traditional PH domains such as in the literatures of marketing, human resources management, organizational behavior, operations management, and others. They would like to be able to formulate searches, for example, that could access a broad range of databases to find evidence related to: (1) return on investment for worksites implementing health programs; (2) programs that have been developed in worksites related to communicable or chronic disease prevention; (3) effective educational strategies to reach employees in worksites; (4) effective interventions to motivate, men, women, elders and other specific population groups to take care of their health; (5) effective quality improvement projects in healthcare organizations; and (6) best practices related to communicable diseases in emergency rooms. They also identified limitations on access to grey literature as well as systematic reviews and full-text of journal articles. Informants stated that not many extensive sources exist for systematic reviews and summary information of interest to PH; however, a few participants were not aware of those that do exist, e.g., the Guide to Community Preventive Services [24].Limitations of existing mechanisms of information access ::: ResultsMany also expressed difficulty keeping track of information they wanted to save for future access and wanted better mechanisms to archive information accessed earlier in a way that could facilitate easy retrieval. Informants also expressed needs for training in electronic accessing skills and the availability of human-mediated searching via article retrieval services.Hypothetical model ::: ResultsIn response to the information content, format and access concerns raised by informants we developed a hypothetical model for PH information access grounded in findings from our data analysis [See Additional file 5 for quotes supporting the features included in the model.] The model (See figure 2) includes PH-specific keywords, user-selected filters, and pre-formulated search criteria for tailoring information sought via both automatic notification systems and search engines; an automatic notification mechanism that would send information to users that has been filtered according to the user's filtering requests; a scanning and reviewing system to locate, critique/review, and provide links to newly published information relevant to PH professionals, and a customized archiving database of credible information accessed by system users.Hypothetical model ::: ResultsIn early 2005 when we presented this model to the CHP participants, the component at the top right said simply ""newly published PH information."" We initially presented the model as an approach to accessing and delivering information that appeared in PubMed. Respondents stated that to be very useful the model would have to facilitate access to information from other sources and disciplines not represented in PubMed. It should also reference descriptions of best PH practices and other information often found in the grey literature. In response to this concern, we added the phrase ""in diverse disciplines of interest"" to the model component on sources of information in the upper right of figure 2. Respondents liked the idea that information would be reviewed before it was disseminated. They expressed a desire to receive a narrative critique of the information from the reviewers and not just numerical ratings expressing the reviewers' findings.Hypothetical model ::: ResultsOther information accessing needs identified fell primarily into the category of grey literature and statistical data. These included the ability to search conference websites via a single portal for cutting edge information and expert contact information; access via keyword search to information the CDC has on programs being implemented in other states; easy access to news articles about what is happening statewide related to health programs in schools and other venues; and a database ""mecca"" for surveillance data.Categories of information ::: DiscussionSix categories of PH information emerged from both groups in our study (see Table 2). The six categories can be arrayed along a continuum based on the amount of available research evidence supporting each of the categories. On the continuum shown in figure 3, we have separated category 5 into two categories: published research reports and meta-analyses/systematic reviews to emphasize the difference between these two resources. The resulting seven-category continuum ranges from limited research support for early descriptions of emerging health threats and new interventions on the lower end of the continuum, through increasing amounts and quality of evidence for the types of information farther along the continuum.Categories of information ::: DiscussionOur classification of PH information extends the typology developed by Nutbeam [4] in that it covers the full range of information needed to inform PH decision-making from basic descriptive data to evidence-based guidelines. Our categories 3–7 are also an expansion of what Brownson [25] calls type 2 evidence or evidence that focuses on the relative effectiveness of specific interventions to address a particular health condition.Categories of information ::: DiscussionLike clinicians practicing medicine, PH practitioners are regularly confronted with new problems and complex tasks that require a timely response, often before researchers can complete studies to offer guidance. Our study confirms the findings of others that PH practitioners need access to information at all levels of research support on the continuum in figure 3. Anderson et al [26] highlighted the need for PH practitioners to access information supported by limited evidence and to weigh the credibility of this information before using it in PH decision-making related to urgent issues that cannot wait for conclusive evidence to accumulate.Information access ::: DiscussionParticipants identified several limitations in information access and in some cases suggested means for overcoming those limitations. The limitations could be classified in three broad categories: (1) limitations affecting timely and convenient delivery of information including limited access to electronic full text of journals, (2) limitations in access to all categories of information in some content areas (i.e., disciplines outside traditional PH) and in the grey literature, and (3) limitations in locating information that is available, including problems with search terms and in organizing archives.Information access ::: DiscussionParticipants did not specifically identify as a problem the very limited availability of summaries, commentaries and critiques of PH studies, even after we had presented to them examples of these resources from both PH and clinical medicine. We hypothesize that one reason informants did not report this limitation is that they have had little or no experience working with these types of resources. It is possible that as more summaries, commentaries and critiques become available to PH practitioners that their desire for more of these resources may increase. Participants did identify the need for access to systematic reviews of interventions that are more population-based and PH-oriented. One of the few resources we identified that has begun addressing this need broadly is the recently developed Health-Evidence.ca website [27] that provides an online registry of systematic reviews of PH interventions. This project, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and conducted by Dr. Maureen Dobbins, searches for systematic reviews in a variety of databases of published literature including PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) [28], EMBASE [29], Sociological Abstracts [30], BIOSIS [31], and PsycINFO [32]. Selected reviews are rated by two independent reviewers. Review information is stored in a searchable registry. The site also provides summaries of the reviews but has not yet included access to unpublished work. Other databases that present summaries of synthesized evidence-based practice information for public health professionals are more limited, such as the Cochrane Health Promotion and Public Health Field website [33] which addresses only a tiny fraction of common public health issues currently, or more specialized, such as the Australian databases for occupational therapists, OTseeker [34,35], and physiotherapists, PeDro [36,37].Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionThe informants offered a number of potential approaches for overcoming the limitations they identified in timely delivery, access, and location of information. They stated a preference for overcoming these limitations via enhancements made to sources and means of information access they were already using such as PubMed and listservs.Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionTo overcome limitations in timely delivery of information, participants suggested that improved access to the full text of journals in electronic form would be critical. Many of the biomedical journals that publish articles relevant to PH professionals are already available in electronic versions, but the cost of offering access to these journals to dozens or hundreds of PH practitioners can be daunting for any local or state public health entity. However, there are some examples in other countries where this has happened. The Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP) [38,39] in New South Wales, Australia, and similar systems in other Australian states, have provided access to over 55,000 clinicians in the public health workforce with access to in excess of 400 such publications by government negotiations for reasonable cost licenses for very large populations. An extensive evaluation of this system is being undertaken to examine how availability of such information influences practices.Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionMany informants from both groups in this study were already receiving news and automatic notification of newly published studies via listservs. Unfortunately comprehensive listservs are available for only a few PH disciplines (e.g., TB Update [60]). Our findings suggest that developing listservs that organize and deliver relevant new information for more PH disciplines may be an effective way to meet some key information needs.Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionA serious limitation of listservs identified by several subjects is that they tend to deliver large amounts of information in formats that make it difficult for a user to quickly seek out specific information relevant to his/her interests. We are aware of several technical means that some listserv administrators are using to deal with this problem. Items in an email can be linked to an index that appears as the first entry in the email. Links take the user to content contained in the email or on a website. Content developers for clinical medical automatic notification services are using two other techniques to help users avoid receiving irrelevant content: (1) breaking content into many subdomains and allowing users to select to receive information from specified subdomains and (2) engaging volunteer users in a process of filtering content by having them rate the quality and relevance of new information before it is delivered to all the users. Adoption of some or all of these strategies by the developers of PH listservs could effectively address some of the concerns raised in our study.Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionThe request for access to a broader base of information from fields outside of traditional PH disciplines was driven by the need to develop effective evidence-based policies in emerging areas of PH practice such as designing environments to promote physical activity or increase pedestrian safety and developing economic justifications to encourage businesses to introduce health-related programs. CHP informants suggested that access to information from other industries, professions and disciplines would be needed including information from the realms of social marketing, advertising, sociology, engineering, human resources management, and others. Some of this information is contained in journals serving the disciplines of interest, which can be searched through reference databases such as CINAHL, EMBASE, Sociological Abstracts, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, and others. Access to information in these journals by PH professionals would require establishing access to the reference databases and to print and/or electronic access to the journals themselves. In domains beyond the biomedical, it is likely many PH professionals, like those in this study, do not have skills to efficiently gather evidence or formulate searches. Either the appropriate keywords and data sources are not known to PH professionals, or concepts and keywords that are familiar to them, such as ""intervention venues"" or the ""built environment"" related to injury prevention, are not used in the other disciplines.Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionEven when PH professionals have ready access to a database of relevant biomedical information such as PubMed, our subjects indicated that locating useful information is hindered by the paucity of PH-oriented search terms. For example, they stated a need for search terms like ""evaluated"", ""cost-effective"", and/or ""population-based interventions"". Development and adoption of more standardized PH search terms could make searches more effective and also facilitate the task of filtering listserv emails. Developers of the Health-Evidence.ca website have not only provided access to systematic reviews of PH interventions but have also made strides in addressing the need for PH-specific search terms. These developers have generated their own set of PH keywords related to domains of PH, population characteristics, intervention sites, intervention strategies and types of reviews (meta-analysis, narrative or systematic).Overcoming access limitations: barriers and options ::: DiscussionPre-formulated search filters use combinations of existing search terms to facilitate identification of information that meet predefined criteria. In clinical medicine, a set of filters aimed at identifying publications reporting high quality, evidence-based studies has been developed, tested and made accessible for routine use in PubMed (PubMed Clinical Queries [41]). The Partners for Information Access for the Public Health Workforce project [42] has developed dozens of pre-formulated searches aimed at locating information in PubMed relevant to specific Healthy People 2010 goals [43]. Wilczynski et al [44] have developed a set of search filters for PubMed to enable efficient retrieval of articles relevant to healthcare quality and costs based on several criteria related to methodological rigor (appropriateness, process assessment, outcomes assessment, costs, economics, and qualitative research) [45]. Although some of our respondents were familiar with some available filters, they did not appear to be using filters on a regular basis to access information. There is clearly a need to develop and promote more and better search terms and filters for PH since these will be important for locating studies for reviews and for skilled and interested users.Limitations ::: DiscussionThe field of public health is so broad that any study of this sort is limited to collecting data in a few domains in a limited number of settings. Caution is advised in generalizing our findings more broadly to communicable and chronic disease prevention and control practitioners, especially those in city or county health departments or working at the federal level. Also, further investigation is needed in other unrelated PH disciplines to test applicability of findings in these areas because of the wide variation in content and nature of PH practices. Another limitation is that our interviews and group discussions may have been biased towards PH workers with the most interest in information issues.ConclusionIt seems clear from our study that it is likely that many critical information needs of PH practitioners are not being met efficiently or at all; however, incremental improvements to PH information access are being made. Projects like Health-Evidence.ca and Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce are emerging. The increasing availability of all types of information on the Internet and ongoing improvements in search methodology and website organization are also occurring, but the task is complex and enormous, and progress seems to be slow. It is our assessment that tools and resources available to clinical medical practitioners are more advanced and sophisticated than those available to PH practitioners. The former include tools such as information sources that summarize and critique findings from research reports (e.g., Cochrane Systematic Reviews) [46]; those for identifying and accessing a broad range of information including basic facts, research findings, expert opinion, and sometimes associated evidence ratings (e.g., electronic texts such as UpToDate) [47]; automatic notification services (e.g., bmj.com Email alerting service) [48]; and periodic, discipline-specific literature updates with summaries and commentaries (e.g., Journal Watch) [49]. We believe one reason for this is that the market for information-related products for medical practitioners is large enough and lucrative enough to attract large investments in many new and creative ventures. The result is a proliferation of well-designed electronic texts, multiple sources of expert summary and critique of the literature, sophisticated and highly tailored automatic notification systems, and many other resources. A second reason that PH practitioners have fewer resources available to them is a lack of good primary research in PH that can be systematically reviewed [3,26]; however, PH practitioners also do not always have ready access to the best evidence that is available such as basic facts and expert opinion.ConclusionBased on our findings from this study, we believe that PH could benefit from a dual strategy for advancing information access. One strategy is the promotion of incremental improvements in existing information sources and access mechanisms, such as providing better and more PH-specific search filters for PubMed and developing more sophisticated listserv applications for disseminating automatic notifications. Initially respondents in this study seemed to favor improvements in simple tools and resources they were familiar with over new and more complex models of information access. This suggests that incremental changes may be more rapidly accepted and adopted than new and unfamiliar systems. However, the generally positive reception to our proposed information access model by the CHP informants, suggests that a well-designed new system that clearly addresses expressed needs could be well received. Given that products are emerging that address some of these needs such as Health-Evidence.ca, the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce website, and the PubMed Health Services Research Queries discussed earlier, there is a clear need to integrate complementary efforts rather than duplicating what has already been done. This cannot be accomplished without collaboration across projects, stakeholders, funding sources, and even national borders. Additionally government entities may be able to negotiate reasonable cost licenses for large PH populations to provide access via emerging systems to many journals relevant to PH practice as has been done in Australia.ConclusionWe suggest that organizations concerned about PH practitioners' access to information should consider joining forces to sponsor further research to evaluate emerging information systems, fund collaborative research projects, and encourage small scale trials of some new systems for information access such as the model system we propose while at the same time continuing to foster ongoing incremental changes. Those systems that are positively received by practitioners and can show significant objective improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of information access for a reasonable cost could then be considered for broader dissemination.AbbreviationsAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ; Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, BCDC; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC; Community Health Promotion, CHP; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, CINAHL; Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health, EBPPH; Massachusetts Department of Public Health, MDPH; public health, PH; severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS; sexually transmitted disease, STDCompeting interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsNRL provided qualitative study design and implementation expertise in drafting the preliminary interview scripts, conducting individual and group interviews, analyzing the data, and drafting preliminary manuscript text, tables and figures.

Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against West Nile virus,"MainWNV is a single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA flavivirus that is related to dengue fever, yellow fever, St. Louis, tick-borne and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Humans infected with WNV develop a febrile illness that can progress to meningitis or encephalitis, and the elderly and immunocompromised are at greatest risk for severe disease1. At present, treatment is supportive and no vaccine exists for human use.MainThe innate and adaptive immune responses prevent WNV dissemination to and within the central nervous system (CNS)2,3. Recently, two groups showed therapeutic efficacy of immune human γ-globulin in mice infected with WNV4,5. Even after virus had spread to the CNS, passive administration of immune heterologous γ-globulin improved survival5. In theory, a potently neutralizing monoclonal antibody could have the same or better benefit with a lower dose and improved safety profile.MainMost neutralizing antibodies against flaviviruses recognize the envelope (E) protein. In general, virus-specific rather than cross-reactive antibodies have the strongest neutralizing activity in vitro and greatest protection in vivo6. Crystallographic analysis of the soluble ectodomain of flavivirus E proteins has shown three domains7,8. Domain I is an eight-stranded β-barrel7,8,9 that participates in the conformational changes associated with the acidification in the endosome10. Domain II contains 12 β-strands and has roles in dimerization, trimerization and fusion7,8,10. Domain III (DIII) adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold, and contains surfaced-exposed loops in the mature virion11,12, which putatively have a role in receptor attachment6,8,13,14. Based on the sequencing of in vitro neutralization escape variants, many neutralizing antibodies against flaviviruses localize to DIII15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.MainHere, we define further the molecular basis of antibody-mediated neutralization of WNV using a large panel of newly generated monoclonal antibodies against WNV E protein. Humanized versions of one of these, E16, retained antigen specificity, avidity and neutralizing activity and protected mice against WNV-induced mortality.Generation of monoclonal antibodies against WNV E protein ::: ResultsPostexposure treatment with neutralizing polyclonal human γ-globulin partially protects mice against WNV5. Although human γ-globulin has potential as an immunotherapy for WNV infection, it has several limitations: (i) it is derived from nonimmune and immune donors and has only a modest specific neutralizing titer5; (ii) batch variability may affect the efficacy of specific preparations; and (iii) as a human blood product, it has an inherent risk of transmitting infectious agents. To overcome these limitations, we developed a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies against WNV and determined the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory potency as a guide for identifying candidates for humanization.Generation of monoclonal antibodies against WNV E protein ::: ResultsWe fused the first 1,290 nucleotides of WNV E protein upstream of a histidine repeat in a baculovirus shuttle vector. The resultant truncated E protein lacked the 71 C-terminal amino acids that correspond to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. We generated recombinant baculoviruses, infected Hi-5 insect cells and purified soluble E protein by nickel-affinity chromatography (data not shown). After immunization and screening 2,000 hybridomas, we isolated 46 new monoclonal antibodies that recognized WNV E protein (Supplementary Table 1 online).Neutralizing activity in vitro ::: ResultsWe evaluated the antibodies for their ability to block WNV infection in BHK21 cells using a standard plaque-reduction assay23. Twelve had strong neutralizing activity that greatly exceeded the potency of immune human γ-globulin, with 50% plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT50) below 2 μg, whereas immune human γ-globulin had a PRNT50 value of 500 μg5. The inhibitory activity of two neutralizing antibodies, E16 and E24, was reproduced in J774.2 mouse macrophages and SW13 human adrenal carcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 1 online) and thus was not specific to fibroblasts.Neutralizing activity in vitro ::: ResultsOne of the potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, E16, inhibited infection of genetically diverse WNV lineage I strains that were isolated from mosquitoes, birds and horses in New York. E16 neutralized all WNV strains with PRNT50 values of 4–18 ng and PRNT90 values of 53–297 ng (Supplementary Table 2 online). Notably, Fab fragments of E16 inhibited WNV (PRNT50, 23 ng), suggesting that neutralization does not require bivalent E protein binding. E16 potently blocked infection with strain 956, the original lineage II strain isolated in 1937 (ref. 24), yet was virus specific, as it neither recognized nor neutralized other flaviviruses including distantly related dengue and yellow fever viruses (data not shown) and closely related Japanese and St. Louis encephalitis viruses (Supplementary Table 2 online).Mapping of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to DIII ::: ResultsTo map our strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, we developed a strategy using yeast surface display25. The ectodomain (amino acids 1–415) or DIII (amino acids 296–415) of WNV E protein were expressed as fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface (Fig. 1a). Monoclonal antibodies that recognize DIII alone are considered DIII specific. Monoclonal antibodies that recognized the E ectodomain but not DIII alone may contact residues that map to domain I or II or both, although cooperative contacts with DIII cannot be ruled out. Most of our 46 monoclonal antibodies recognized yeast that displayed the entire ectodomain of E (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 online). Sixteen antibodies recognized yeast that displayed DIII alone, and 10 of 12 strongly neutralizing antibodies localized to DIII. Only two neutralizing antibodies (E53 and E60) recognized the E ectodomain but not DIII alone.Mapping of contact residues of DIII monoclonal antibodies ::: ResultsWe used error-prone PCR mutagenesis of DIII of WNV E protein and yeast surface expression to map antibody contact residues in a high-throughput manner. We performed individual screens to identify DIII mutants that lost binding selectively to strongly neutralizing (E16, E24 and E34), weakly neutralizing (E1), and non-neutralizing (E2 and E22) monoclonal antibodies. To eliminate mutants that abolished surface expression of DIII, yeast were stained sequentially with an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated individual monoclonal antibodies and an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated oligoclonal antibody derived from a pool of individual monoclonal antibodies. After cell sorting, we identified yeast that selectively lost expression of an individual monoclonal antibody epitope but retained surface expression of DIII (Fig. 1b). Multiple independent yeast that lost binding of individual monoclonal antibodies were subjected to plasmid recovery and sequencing.Mapping of contact residues of DIII monoclonal antibodies ::: ResultsMonoclonal antibodies that localized to DIII and strongly neutralized WNV had reduced binding when residues S306, K307, T330 or T332 were altered (Fig. 2a and Table 1). These are located on adjacent loops and form a contiguous patch16 on the solvent-exposed surface at the lateral tip of the DIII (Fig. 2b). Only two other mutations caused considerable loss of binding of any of the ten neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested: K310E or P315R reduced binding only of E49. No two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies had identical loss-of-binding patterns. For example, S306L reduced binding of E16, E27, E40, E43 and E49 but not E24, E33, E34, E47 and E58. K307R abolished binding of E34, E40, E43, E47, E49 and E58 but affected E16, E24, E27 and E33 less strongly. In contrast, K307E decreased binding of all neutralizing monoclonal antibodies yet did not affect non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Changes in residues T330 and T332 also abolished binding of neutralizing but not non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. T330I or T332M strongly reduced binding of all neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with the exception of E27, and T332V or T332A weakened binding of only E24, E27, E33 and E58.Mapping of contact residues of DIII monoclonal antibodies ::: ResultsSix monoclonal antibodies that recognized DIII were either poorly neutralizing or non-neutralizing, and none engaged the dominant neutralizing epitope defined by S306, K307, T330 or T332. E2 and E9 were abolished or reduced by mutation of D381 and H396, and binding of E22 was weakened by a change in P315. D381 and H396 are proximal to one another but physically distinct from the four residues that affect binding of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2b). None of the mutations identified by loss-of-binding sorts for E2 or E22 had any effect on two other non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, E21 and E23. E1, a monoclonal antibody with weak neutralizing activity, mapped to a site between the non-neutralizing and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as mutation of K310 and N394 strongly inhibited binding.Patient antibodies recognize the dominant neutralizing epitope ::: ResultsTo determine whether human antibodies specific for WNV recognize the neutralizing epitope on DIII during infection, plasma was obtained from WNV-positive individuals. Samples from convalescent individuals were negative for WNV RNA but positive for neutralizing WNV-specific antibodies. The individuals reported mild systemic illness, though none progressed to severe disease. To determine whether these samples contained antibodies that localized to the neutralizing epitope on DIII, we tested whether E16 Fab or IgG could compete binding to recombinant, wild-type and mutant N394K and K307N forms of DIII (Supplementary Fig. 2 online); N394K retains wild-type binding to E16, whereas K307N has markedly reduced binding. E16 equivalently inhibited binding of patient WNV-specific antibodies to wild-type (Fab, 35% ± 8; IgG, 40% ± 12) or N394K DIII (Fab, 32% ± 9; IgG, 34% ± 11), whereas E53 IgG, a WNV-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope outside DIII, did not compete binding to wild-type (1% ± 4) or N394K (−2% ± 5) DIII. As expected, E16, which only weakly recognizes K307N, poorly competed (Fab 6% ± 3; IgG 9% ± 4) binding to K307N DIII. These data suggest that humans, who clear WNV infection, develop antibodies that recognize an epitope in close proximity to that defined by E16.Therapeutic studies in mice ::: ResultsTo evaluate the correlation between neutralization, epitope localization and in vivo protection, we assessed the therapeutic activity of different neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in an established mouse model5. Studies were performed with 5-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice, which have a ∼10% survival rate5. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 102 plaque-forming units (PFU) of WNV and administered a single dose of monoclonal antibody at day 2 after infection. Notably, 500 μg of the non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody E2 provided no protection (data not shown). In contrast, 100 μg of any of three different neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that map to K307 (E16, E24 or E34) protected greater than 90% of mice from lethal infection (Fig. 3a–c). Even a single 4 μg treatment of E16 or E34 on day 2 after infection prevented mortality.Therapeutic studies in mice ::: ResultsGiven that humans can present with WNV infection of the CNS, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies at later time points. At days 4, 5 and 6 after WNV infection, we detected virus in the brains of 67%, 78% and 83% of mice, respectively (Fig. 3d). A single 500 μg dose of E16 or E34 at day 4 resulted in an 80–90% survival rate (Fig. 3e). A single 2 mg dose of E16 at day 5 resulted in 90% survival (Fig. 3f) and complete clearance of WNV from the brain in 68% of mice by day 9 (Fig. 3g). Thus, administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to mice with active CNS infection improved survival and induced a virologic cure. As expected, lengthening the interval before treatment was associated with decreased benefit. Administration of E16 at day 6 did not enhance survival (data not shown), although average survival time was increased (9.5 d ± 0.4 to 11.5 d ± 0.4; P = 0.003).Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsWe considered humanizing E16 or E34 as a possible therapeutic measure. Humanized monoclonal antibodies have substantially longer half-lives in humans than their mouse counterparts26,27. Sequencing studies indicated that E16 had greater homology to human framework regions, making it simpler to construct a humanized version of E16.Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsWe amplified the cDNA encoding the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains from the hybridoma cellular RNA by a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure. The VH belongs to mouse heavy chain subgroup II (J558 family) and the VL belongs to mouse κ chain subgroup V. The complementarity-determining regions of E16 were grafted onto the human VH1–18 backbone (Fig. 4a) and human Vκ-B3 backbone (Fig. 4b) to create Hm-E16.1. One (VL-Y49S) and two framework back-mutations (VH-T71A and VL-Y49S) were introduced to create two variants, Hm-E16.1 and Hm-E16.3, respectively. The resulting humanized VH and VL were combined with human γ1 and κ constant regions, fused to an IgG signal sequence and inserted into expression plasmids. To construct the chimerized antibodies, the mouse VH and VL sequences were combined with the human γ1 and κ constant regions.Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsWe expressed humanized (Hm-E16) and chimerized (Ch-E16) E16 in HEK-293 cells, and purified them from supernatants by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The affinity was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using purified antibody in the solid phase. Mouse E16 binds DIII with an affinity of 3.4 nM and a half-life of 3.9 min. The affinity of the Ch-E16 and Hm-E16 was similar with KD ranging from 7.1 to 21 nM (Fig. 4c). Hm-E16, Ch-E16, and the parent E16 all had similar PRNT50 values (Fig. 4d).Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsWe hypothesized that E16 could also control infection in mice through effector functions including antibody-dependent complement fixation and cytotoxicity. To test this, we generated a Ch-E16 N297Q aglycosyl variant that neutralizes WNV (Fig. 4d) but does not efficiently fix complement or bind Fc γ receptors28. Mice were administered Ch-E16 or Ch-E16 N297Q at day 2 after WNV infection. Although high doses of Ch-E16 and Ch-E16 N297Q provided virtually complete protection, lower doses of the aglycosyl variant afforded less protection (Fig. 4e). Administration of 4 μg of Ch-E16 resulted in 84% survival, whereas 4 μg of Ch-E16 N297Q provided only 31% protection.Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsTo test which effector function enhanced the activity of E16, we performed studies with 8-week-old C1qa, C4, or Fcgr1 and Fcgr3-deficient C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 5). These mice all show increased susceptibility to lethal WNV infection compared to wild-type controls. In C1qa or C4-deficient mice, which cannot activate complement by the antibody-dependent classical pathway, E16 had a similar potency compared to wild-type mice. In contrast, in Fcgr1- and Fcgr3-deficient mice, although high doses afforded complete protection, lower doses resulted in higher mortality rates. A dose of 20 μg at day 2, which strongly protected wild-type, C1qa or C4-deficient mice, did not improve the survival rate of Fcgr1- and Fcgr3-deficient mice (P = 0.4). Thus, the Fc region enhances the potency of E16 in mice, by virtue of its ability to bind to Fc γ receptors.Humanization of E16 ::: ResultsTo confirm the efficacy of humanized E16, wild-type mice were administered three different versions of purified Hm-E16 at day 2 after infection. Although Hm-E16 variants protected mice against lethal infection (Fig. 4f), at a dose of 4 μg, the variant (16.3) that showed the highest affinity for DIII (Fig. 4c) was more protective (67% versus 46% survival; mean survival time of 14 ± 1 d versus 11 ± 2 d, P = 0.04).DiscussionWe generated a panel of 46 monoclonal antibodies against WNV E protein, and applied a new high-throughput epitope-mapping strategy to identify a dominant epitope that was recognized by the majority of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in DIII. This epitope was also detected by convalescent antibodies from individuals who had recovered from WNV infection without clinical consequence. Three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies protected against WNV mortality in a postexposure therapy model. One of these, E16, was humanized and confirmed as therapeutically effective in mice.DiscussionPrevious studies have mapped amino acid contact residues of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies by sequencing in vitro neutralization escape variants, through site-specific substitution of specific charged or polar residues, and by performing binding assays with overlapping peptide libraries. We used error-prone PCR mutagenesis and yeast surface expression to identify contact residues in a high-throughput manner. Although this technique has been used previously29, this is the first high-throughput epitope-mapping application. By having a large panel of DIII monoclonal antibodies and selecting only variants that abolished or markedly reduced binding of a few monoclonal antibodies, we minimized the possibility that mutations altered protein folding. We have recently confirmed the recognition sites on DIII for E16 and the validity of the yeast display strategy by solving the crystal structure of the E16 Fab-DIII complex (G.N., T.O., M.D, & D.F., unpublished data).DiscussionOf 12 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, 10 localized to the distal lateral surface of DIII, results that are consistent with prior studies that mapped three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against WNV using in vitro escape variants15,30. Our weakly neutralizing and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies did not recognize this epitope but localized to distinct regions. E16 recognized the dominant epitope and neutralized all strains that were tested. Sequence analysis of 124 WNV strains in public databases showed almost complete (98.4–100%) conservation of the contact residues S306, K307, T330 and T332. Only two clinically attenuated lineage II isolates had mutations at these residues. Because of the structural homology among flaviviruses7,8,16, the analogous amino acids that map to the distal lateral surface of DIII can be readily identified. Although this region is highly variable among flaviviruses, most mutations that abolish binding of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies map here15,18,30,31, suggesting the existence of an analogous dominant neutralizing epitope for other flaviviruses. We speculate that successful vaccines against WNV or other flaviviruses should induce potent humoral responses against this neutralizing epitope.DiscussionAlthough passive administration of immune human γ-globulin after WNV infection improved survival in mice4,5, it may be limited by its low-titer neutralizing activity, variability and risk of transmission of infectious agents. Only two prior studies have shown postexposure therapy of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with flaviviruses: 6B5A-2 reduced mortality 3–4 d after infection with St. Louis encephalitis virus6; and 503 reduced mortality resulting from infection with Japanese encephalitis virus 5 d32. Here, we show that three different neutralizing monoclonal antibodies improved survival even when administered 4 and 5 d after WNV infection. Moreover, therapy with E16 at day 5 completely cleared WNV from the brain at day 9 in 68% of mice. Thus, inhibitory WNV monoclonal antibodies improve clinical and virologic outcome even after viral spread through the CNS, results that agree with studies showing that antibody can mediate viral clearance from infected neurons33,34.DiscussionOur experiments are consistent with a model in which the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies is determined by properties in addition to neutralization: (i) the monoclonal antibody (E24) with the strongest neutralizing activity in vitro did not have the greatest efficacy in vivo; (ii) an aglycosyl version of E16 that lacked the ability to fix complement or bind to Fc γ receptors had equivalent neutralizing but reduced therapeutic activity; (iii) E16 was less potent in mice that lacked Fc γ receptors.DiscussionE16 was humanized as a possible therapeutic measure for humans. Hm-E16 bound DIII with similar affinity and showed efficacy as postexposure therapy. Moreover, it may be possible to improve Hm-E16 by introducing mutations that enhance affinity, creating forms of E16 that more readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and combining monoclonal antibodies that neutralize WNV infection through independent mechanisms. Our results are the first successful demonstration of a humanized monoclonal antibody as postexposure therapy against a viral disease, and suggest that antibody-based therapeutics may have more broad utility than previously appreciated, especially in the treatment of CNS infections in which an effective antibody response is important for limiting virus dissemination and injury to neurons.Cells and viruses. ::: MethodsWe cultured BHK-21, Vero and C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells as previously described35. J774.2 mouse macrophages and SW13 human adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The majority of experiments were performed with the WNV strain (3000.0259, passage 2) that was isolated from a Culex restuans mosquito in New York in 2000. We performed additional neutralization experiments with lineage I strains from New York from the years 2000–2003 (03001956, 32010157, NYC01035, 03002094, 02002640, 02002831, 02003688, 31000352, 00-7365) and a lineage II strain (956) isolated from a human in patient Uganda in 1937 (refs. 24,36). We also performed neutralization experiments with prototype strains of St. Louis (59268 (Parton)) and Japanese encephalitis (Nakayama) viruses37. For in vivo experiments, viruses were diluted and injected into mice as described23.Purified WNV E protein expression. ::: MethodsWNV E protein ectodomain was generated using a baculovirus expression system according to previously described methods for related flaviviruses38. The last 45 nucleotides of prM (endogenous signal sequence) and the first 1,290 nucleotides of WNV E protein from the New York 1999 strain39 were fused downstream of the polyhedrin promoter and upstream of a histidine repeat in a baculovirus shuttle vector (pFastBac, Invitrogen) by PCR using a high-fidelity Taq polymerase (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen). Three days after baculovirus infection of Hi-5 insect cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, supernatants were harvested, filtered, buffer-exchanged and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified WNV E ectodomain lacks the C-terminal 71 amino acids that are associated with the membrane proximal, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.Purified WNV DIII. ::: MethodsThe construction, expression, purification and refolding of DIII of WNV E protein is described in greater detail elsewhere (G.N., T.O., M.D. & D.F., unpublished data). Briefly, wild-type, N394K and K307N DIII were generated from an infectious cDNA clone of the New York 1999 strain of WNV (gift of R. Kinney, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO) using PCR and Quik-change mutagenesis (Stratagene). After cloning into a PET21 vector (Novagen) and sequence confirmation of the mutations, we transformed plasmids into BL21 Codon Plus E. coli cells (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown in Luria broth, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) and pelleted. Subsequently, we lysed bacteria after the addition of lysozyme, sonicated them and recovered DIII as insoluble aggregate from the inclusion bodies. DIII was denatured in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride and β-mercaptoethanol and refolded by slowly diluting out the denaturing reagents in the presence of L-arginine, EDTA, PMSF, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione. We separated refolded DIII from aggregates on a Superdex 75 16/60 size-exclusion column (Amersham Bioscience) and concentrated it using a centricon-10 spin column into 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% NaN3. After refolding, wild-type DIII reacted with all domain III–specific monoclonal antibodies including those that recognized conformationally sensitive epitopes.Generation and purification of monoclonal antibodies. ::: MethodsBALB/c mice were primed and boosted at 3-week intervals with insect cell–generated, purified, recombinant WNV E protein (25 μg) that was complexed with adjuvant (RIBI Immunochemical). Approximately 1 month after the last boost, we harvested serum and tested it for immunoreactivity against solid-phase purified E. Mice with high titers (>1/10,000) were boosted intravenously with purified E protein (5 μg) in PBS. We harvested splenocytes 3 d later and fused them to P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma cells to generate hybridomas according to published procedures40. We purified monoclonal antibodies against WNV or other control antigens by standard protein A or protein G chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia).Mouse experiments. ::: MethodsFor WNV infection experiments, all wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from a commercial source (Jackson Laboratories). We obtained the congenic C1qa-deficient and C4-deficient mice from G. Stahl (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) and M. Carroll (The CBR Institute for Biomedical Research, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. We obtained the congenic Fcgr1- and Fcgr3-deficient mice commercially (Taconic). We used mice between 5 and 8 weeks of age depending on the particular experiment and inoculated them subcutaneously with WNV by footpad injection after anesthetization with xylazine and ketamine. Mouse experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Safety Committee.Mouse experiments. ::: MethodsFor passive-transfer experiments, we administered to mice a single dose of purified monoclonal antibody by intraperitoneal injection at a given time point (day 2, 4 or 5) after infection. To analyze virus production in the brain, infected mice were killed on a given day after inoculation. After cardiac perfusion with PBS, we removed the brains, weighed and homogenized them, and performed plaque assays as previously described23.Expression of WNV E protein on yeast. ::: MethodsThe ectodomain or DIII of WNV E protein was expressed on the surface of yeast using a modification of a previously described protocol for surface expression of T cell receptors29. Amino acid residues 1–415 (ectodomain) or 296–415 (DIII) of WNV E protein were amplified with BamHI and XhoI sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, by PCR from the New York 1999 infectious cDNA clone (R. Kinney, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO). The resulting products were digested with BamHI and XhoI, and cloned as downstream fusions to the yeast Aga2 and Xpress epitope tag genes in the yeast surface display vector pYD1 (Invitrogen). An upstream GAL1 promoter controls fusion protein expression. These constructs were transfected into the S. cerevesiae yeast strain EBY100 (refs. 25,41) resulting in yeast that expressed the WNV E ectodomain or DIII. Yeast that only expressed the Xpress epitope tag linked to Aga2 were prepared in parallel by transfecting EBY100 cells with the parent vector pYD1. Individual yeast colonies were grown to log phase overnight in tryptophan-free media containing 2% glucose at 30 °C and harvested in log phase. Fusion protein expression was induced on the yeast surface by growing yeast for an additional 24 h in tryptophan-free media containing 2% galactose at 25 °C. We harvested yeast, washed them with PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and immunostained them with 50 μl of monoclonal antibody (25 μg/ml) against the Xpress tag or WNV E protein. After 30 min, we washed yeast three times and stained them with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes). Subsequently, the yeast cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCaliber flow cytometer.Library construction and screening. ::: MethodsWe mutated DIII of the WNV E protein using an error-prone PCR protocol25 that included Mn2+ and Mg2+ at concentrations of 0.3 and 2.0 mM respectively. Subsequently, the cDNA library was ligated into pYD1 and transformed into XL2-blue ultracompetent cells (Strategene). The colonies were pooled and the plasmid DNA was recovered using the Qiagen HiSpeed Maxi kit.Library construction and screening. ::: MethodsFor each individual antibody, we screened the yeast library of DIII mutants according to the following protocol. To identify yeast that selectively lost binding to a given monoclonal antibody epitope, the library was initially stained with an Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated WNV-specific monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. To control for the surface expression of DIII, after washing, yeast were subsequently stained for 30 min at 4 °C with an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated oligoclonal antibody that was derived from a pool of individual monoclonal antibodies (E1, E2, E9, E16, E24 and E34). After immunostaining, we subjected yeast to flow cytometry and identified the population that was single monoclonal antibody negative but pooled oligoclonal antibody positive. The yeast cells were sorted at an event rate of ∼4,000 cells/s and this population (monoclonal antibody–negative and oligoclonal antibody–positive) was enriched after three rounds of sorting. After the final enrichment sort, we plated yeast and selected individual colonies and tested them for binding to individual monoclonal antibodies. For individual clones that had lost only the desired monoclonal antibody epitope, the DIII-pYD1 plasmid was recovered using the Zymoprep Yeast Miniprep kit (Zymo Research). The plasmid was then transformed into DH5α cells, purified using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced.Library construction and screening. ::: MethodsIn some cases, DIII variants with two independent mutations were isolated. To determine which mutation conferred the loss-of-binding phenotype, single independent mutations were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis of DIII-pYD1 using mutant oligonucleotides and the Quik Change II mutagenesis kit (Strategene). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Quantification and characterization of neutralizing antibodies in vitro. ::: MethodsWe determined the titer of neutralizing antibodies by a standard plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) assay using either BHK21 or SW13 cells23. Results were plotted and the titers for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% inhibition (PRNT90) were calculated. The inhibition assay with J774.2 mouse macrophages was performed as follows: we mixed medium and E16 or E24 (2.5 μg of monoclonal antibody) with 5 × 102 PFU of WNV, incubated the mixture for 1 h at 4 °C, and then added to 5 × 104 J774.2 mouse macrophages in individual wells of a 24-well plate. After 1 h, cells were washed four times with PBS to remove free virus and monoclonal antibody, DMEM with 10% FBS was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. We subsequently harvested supernatants for a viral plaque assay on Vero cells.Competition ELISA with human anti-WNV antibodies. ::: MethodsAfter purification and refolding, wild-type, K307N and N394K DIII were diluted (5 μg/ml) in 0.1 M Na carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and adsorbed to 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with PBS, 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-BT), wells were preincubated for 1 h at 23 °C with PBS-BT containing no antibody, E16 IgG (50 μg/ml), E16 Fab (50 μg/ml) or E53 IgG (50 μg/ml). E53 serves as a negative control as it recognizes an epitope in domain I and II of WNV E protein. Subsequently, human plasma (1/40 dilution in PBS-BT, heat-inactivated) was directly added for an additional 1 h at 23 °C. We obtained the human samples with informed consent from seven different WNV-infected patients (gift of M. Busch and L. Tobler, Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA). Because the samples were sequentially numbered and not linkable back to the original subjects, they satisfied the criteria for exemption from approval from the Human Studies Committee at Washington University. After six washes with PBS-BT, plates were serially incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1 μg/ml), streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase (2 μg/ml) and tetramethyl-benzidine developing substrate (DAKO). We determined optical densities at 450 nm with an automatic ELISA plate reader (Tecan) and adjusted them after subtraction of the value obtained from nonimmune human plasma.Surface plasmon resonance. ::: MethodsAntibody affinity analysis for DIII of WNV was performed by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore 3000, Biacore, Inc). Binding curves and kinetic parameters were obtained as follows: we captured E16 antibodies by flowing (300 nM, rate of 5 μl/min for 2 min) them over immobilized F(ab)'2 fragment specific for goat anti-human or mouse IgG with Fc region specificity. Subsequently, DIII of the New York 1999 strain of WNV E protein (amino acids 296–415), which was generated in E. coli, was injected (6.25–200 nM, flow rate 70 μl/min for 1.5 min and then allowed to dissociate over 5 min). The F(ab)'2 surface was regenerated by pulse injection of 10 mM glycine (pH 1.5) and 100 mM NaOH before each E16 injection. We analyzed curves with a global fit 1:1 binding algorithm with drifting baseline.Cloning and humanization of E16. ::: MethodsE16 heavy- and light-chain RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells after guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol-chloroform extraction, and converted to cDNA by reverse transcription. The VH and VL segments were amplified by PCR using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) system (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers (GSP) for VH and VL were as follows: VH-GSP1: 5′-GGTCACTGTCACTGGCTCAGGG-3′; VH-GSP2: 5′-AGGCGGATCCAGGGGCCAGTGGATAGAC-3′; VL-GSP1: 5′-GCACACGACTGAGGCACCTCCAGATG-3′; and VL-GSP2: 5′ CGGATCCGATGGATACAGTTGGTGCAGCATC-3′. The PCR products were inserted into the plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO using the TopoTA kit (Invitrogen). We then subjected the resulting plasmids to DNA sequencing to determine the VH and VL sequences for E16. The cDNA sequences were translated and the predicted amino acid sequence determined. From these sequences the framework and CDR regions were identified as previously defined42. We joined the mouse VH to a human C-γ1 constant region and an Ig leader sequence, and inserted it into pCI-neo for mammalian expression. We joined the mouse VL to a human Cκ segment and an Ig leader sequence and also cloned it into pCI-neo for mammalian expression of chimeric E16 (Ch-E16). For Ch-E16, site-directed mutagenesis was also performed to change residue 297 from asparagine to glutamine of the heavy chain to eliminate the single glycosylation site on the γ1 Fc.Cloning and humanization of E16. ::: MethodsHumanized E16 VH consists of the framework segments from the human germline VH1-18 VH segment and JH6 segment43,44, and the CDR regions of the E16 VH, respectively. The humanized E16 VL consists of the framework segments of the human germline VK-B3 VL segment and JK2, (refs. 45–47) segment and the CDR regions of E16 VL. The humanized VH segments were assembled de novo from oligonucleotides and amplified by PCR. The humanized VL segments were assembled by PCR and overlapping PCR. The resulting VH and VL segments were subsequently combined by overlapping PCR with a leader sequence and the appropriate constant region segment and cloned into the expression vector pCI-neo as NheI-EcoRI fragments. We confirmed the DNA sequence of the resulting plasmids by sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed to substitute mouse for human residues at key framework positions VH-71 (T71A) and VL-49 (Y49S). The resulting plasmids were cotransfected into human 293 cells using lipofectamine-2000 and humanized antibody was recovered from the resulting conditioned medium and purified by protein A and size-exclusion chromatography.Statistical analysis. ::: MethodsAll data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Software). For survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed by the log-rank and Mantel-Haenszel test. For viral burden experiments, we determined statistical significance using the Mann-Whitney test.Statistical analysis. ::: MethodsNote: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Medicine website."
Polyadenylation of genomic RNA and initiation of antigenomic RNA in a positive-strand RNA virus are controlled by the same cis-element,"The genomic RNA of many positive-strand RNA viruses is tailed with a 3′-poly(A). In contrast to cellular mRNAs, in which poly(A) is non-templated and is added post-transcriptionally, the viral poly(A) is believed to be template-coded (1). Accordingly, the negative strand contains a 5′-poly(U) tract, which is synthesized using the poly(A) of the positive viral RNA as a template. In turn, this poly(U) subsequently serves as a template for the synthesis of the poly(A) of progeny RNA. This alternate usage of the homopolymeric parts of the (+) and (−) RNA for each strand synthesis has not been studied in detail but it was observed that poly(U) in the negative RNA of poliovirus (2,3) and coronavirus (4) may be shorter than poly(A) in the viral RNAs. These observations pose intriguing questions about how a shorter poly(U) is synthesized on a longer poly(A) template and vice versa.INTRODUCTIONWe addressed this conundrum using coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an enterovirus belonging to the picornavirus family as a model. Picornaviruses are small icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded 7–8 kb RNA genome of positive (mRNA-like) polarity. This family includes important human and animal pathogens such as poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus and others.INTRODUCTIONThree cis-acting elements are known to be involved in the replication of enterovirus RNA (5). The 5′-terminal cloverleaf structure (or oriL) is a multifunctional element that interacts, among other ligands, with viral 3CDpro protease and cellular poly(rC) binding proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2 (6–8) to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This complex is thought to be involved in the switch that represses translation and allows replication to commence (9), and is also required for the initiation of both (+)-strand (6) and (−)-strand RNA synthesis. The latter requires genome circularization mediated by an interaction between this RNP and the host poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to 3′-poly(A) (10,11).INTRODUCTIONAnother cis-acting replicative element (cre or oriI) is represented by an imperfect stem–loop located within the coding region of the enterovirus RNA (12–14). It ensures the covalent linkage of uridylates to the viral protein VPg via a two-step slide-back mechanism, thereby yielding the protein primer VPg-pU(pU) (15–18). Both (−)- and (+)-strand RNA 5′-termini have VPg covalently bound (5), but there is no consensus on whether the cre-mediated VPg-uridylylation is required for the initiation of only (+) RNA (19–21) or for the initiation of both strands (14). The former view implies that VPg uridylylation may occur directly on the 3′-poly(A) of (+) RNA, thus providing a primer for elongation into (−)-strands, in line with the finding that polyadenylates indeed support VPg-pUpU synthesis in vitro (22).INTRODUCTIONA third replicative cis-element, the oriR, is located in the 3′-noncoding region (3′NCR) of the viral RNA immediately upstream of the 3′-poly(A). It contains a multi-domain structure maintained by an intramolecular kissing interaction between helical elements X and Y (23–28). Mutations destroying this interaction or changing the mutual orientation of oriR helical elements resulted in a significant loss of fitness, as judged by the acquisition of temperature sensitive and quasi-infectious or lethal phenotypes. It was proposed that oriR is required for an efficient initiation of (−) RNA synthesis (24,26). However, partial and complete deletions of the 3′NCR still generated viable viruses challenging the essential role of 3′NCR and oriR in RNA replication (29–31).INTRODUCTIONThe synthesis of a (−) RNA strand on the viral RNA template is believed to result in the formation of a genome-length double-stranded ‘replicative form’ (RF) RNA. Positive-strand RNA synthesis is initiated at the 3′-end of the (−) strand but the detailed mechanism is unknown. It has been proposed that destabilization and partial unwinding of this end of the duplex is required for efficient replication (32,33). Transcription of the (+)-strands from the (−)-RNA template results in partially double-stranded ‘replicative intermediate’ RNA molecules consisting of full-length (−) RNA and various numbers of incomplete (+) strands differing in length (5). Newly synthesized virion RNAs are thought to be displaced from the (−) strands by upcoming progeny strands through the duplex-unwinding activity of the viral RNA polymerase 3Dpol (34). However, a number of important issues pertaining to picornavirus genome replication remain contradictory or unsolved (35).INTRODUCTIONHere, we examined the mechanism for poly(A) and poly(U) synthesis and how their lengths are controlled. We found that the 3′-poly(A) of (+) RNA strands in CVB3 and some other enteroviruses is about 4-fold longer than the 5′-poly(U) of (−) strands and that the poly(A) length is controlled by the oriR. While ensuring efficient negative strand initiation, the oriR does not control the poly(U) length. Removal of the poly(A) (alone or together with the oriR) from transfected viral RNA resulted in regeneration of poly(A)-containing 3′-tails, which, however, ensured only inefficient viral reproduction. These results provide new insights into mechanisms and evolution of genome replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.Cells and media ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSBuffalo green monkey (BGM) cells were grown in minimal essential medium, MEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U penicillin per ml and 100 mg streptomycin per ml (Sigma). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's MEM (Gibco) with the same supplements (but with streptomycin at 25 mg/ml). HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL 2.2) were grown either (i) in tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium-nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham) (1:1) (Sigma) with the above supplements or (ii) in suspension using suspension MEM (Joklik modified) (Sigma) supplemented with l-glutamine, antibiotics and 10% newborn calf serum (Gibco).Randomization of 3′NCR ::: Coxsackievirus cDNA mutant constructs ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSMutations were introduced into the infectious pRibCB3/T7 construct (14) by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides (Biolegio, The Netherlands). An oligonucleotide (Supplementary Data) containing 70 random residues downstream of the stop codon (N70) functioned as template in a PCR executed by ThermoPerfect DNA polymerase (Integro). Gel-purified products were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and selected clones were sequences as described below. The DraI and SalI restriction sites incorporated in the PCR primers were used to clone the insert into pRibCB3/T7-Stu (7310) digested with StuI and SalI. Sequence analysis verified the correct clones. Replicons in which the P1 region was replaced by the firefly luciferase gene were devised by a BssHII–SalI digestion (14).Partial deletion constructs and kissing distortion mutants ::: Coxsackievirus cDNA mutant constructs ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe p53CB3/T7-ΔX, p53CB3/T7-ΔY, pRibCB3/T7-ΔXΔY, pRibCB3/T7-Δpoly(A), p53CB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-N70/A-Δpoly(A), p53CB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-N70/A-Δpoly(A)+AAUAAA, p53CB3/T7-Δpoly(A)+C9G, p53CB3/T7-Δpoly(A)+G23, pRibCB3/T7-Kissing distortion (KD) 6bp, pRibCB3/T7-KD 6bp+C, pRibCB3/T7-KD-4bp constructs were generated by PCR amplification using an infectious clone or p53CB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-N70/A (p53CB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-N70/A-Δpoly(A) and p53CB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-N70/A-Δpoly(A)+AAUAAA) as templates and amplification primers (Supplementary Data). PCR products were introduced into a p53- or pRibCB3/T7 infectious clone or luciferase replicon using the restriction sites mentioned above. With the exception of the Δpoly(A) constructs all other mutant constructs contained a poly(A) tail of 30 residues. The pRibCB3/T7-Δ3′NCR-Δpoly(A) was engineered using the complementary primer set 5′-AAATGGTTGGACTCCT4AG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTA4GGAGTCCAACCATTT–3′ already containing the correct overhang to be cloned in pRibCB3/T7-Stu(7310) as described above. For pRibCB3/T7-Δ3′NCR, pRibCB3/T7-Δ3′NCR+G15 and pRibCB3/T7-Δ3′NCR+C14G the same method was used (for primers see Supplementary Data). The p53CB3/T7-luc constructs varying in 3′-poly(A) size were PCR-generated using FPmut3NCR containing a DraI-site and RPA0-60 reverse oligonucleotides (Supplementary Data), containing a SalI restriction site. PCR products digested with DraI and SalI were cloned into the p53CB3/T7-luc-Stu (7310) digested with StuI and SalI, rendering constructs containing alternate 3′-poly(A) sizes after transcription.Blocking the 3′-termini of transcript RNA with cordycepin-5′-triphosphate ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSCordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine, Ambion) was added to the 3′ end of in vitro transcribed RNA using yeast poly(A) polymerase (USB) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.RNA transcription and transfection ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSSalI or MluI linearized cDNA served as templates for in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) (26). BGM cells were transfected in duplicate by a DEAE-dextran method (26) and incubated at 36°C and 5% CO2 until complete CPE. Then, the cultures were subjected to three cycles of freezing/thawing prior to storage at −80°C. If 6 days post-transfection no CPE was evident, the cells were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles and 200 µl of cell suspension was transferred to a fresh culture (post-passage). The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was determined by endpoint titration in BGM-cells (36).Sequencing of recovered virus RNA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSViral RNA extraction was performed using the GenElute™ Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma). RNA was reverse transcribed using Super RT (HT Biotechnology) and RT1 (Supplementary Data) and PCR-amplified using FPseq and RPseq. RT–PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Two independent sequence reactions of selected clones were performed by capillary electrophoresis (3730 DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems) and Big Dye Terminator version 3 protocols (Applied Biosystems).Virus purification ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTwo T150 flasks of either HeLa cells (for CVA21 strain Coe) or BGM cells (for CVB3 strain Nancy, EV71 strain BrCr and ECHO9strain Hill) were infected and incubated until complete CPE. After three freeze/thaw cycles, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2500 r.p.m. Supernatants were collected in Beckmann centrifuge tubes containing 5 ml of 30% sucrose. Virions were pelleted at 140 000× g for 6 h (SW28 rotor, Beckman L8-70M centrifuge). The pellet was resuspended in 200 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and viral RNA was extracted as described above.Tailing of the 3′-end of virion RNA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODST4 RNA ligase (Promega) was used to attach an RNA oligonucleotide to virion RNA extracted from purified virus (Figure 1A). A complementary cDNA reverse primer (1) primed the RT reaction. The generated cDNA was amplified using primer 1 and virus-specific forward primers (Supplementary Data). In addition, a semi-nested-PCR was performed using primer 1 and semi-nested (SN) virus specific primers (Supplementary Data) to enhance specificity of the PCR and to increase the quantity of amplified product. The accumulated product was gel-purified and sequenced using the semi-nested PCR forward primers.5′-RACE-assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODST25 flasks containing, depending on the virus strain (see above), BGM or HeLa cells were infected with an MOI of 10 TCID50/cell. Cells were lysed 6 h post infection (p.i.) and total RNA was obtained as described above. A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE)-PCR was performed using the 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Figure 1B). In brief, the RT-reaction on (−) RNA strands was executed by SuperScript™ II (Invitrogen) with virus-specific RT primers (Supplementary Data). After first strand cDNA synthesis, an RNase removed the original RNA template. Single-stranded cDNA was purified and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Invitrogen) added a 3′-poly(C) stretch. This cDNA was PCR-amplified using an AAP primer (Abridged Anchor Primer; 5′-RACE system, Invitrogen) and virus-specific forward primers (Supplementary Data), followed by a nested-PCR using an AUAP primer (Abridged Universal Amplification Primer) and virus-specific nested primers (Supplementary Data) to enhance specificity of the PCR and to increase the quantity of amplified product. The PCR background did not allow direct sequencing of the PCR-product, although the band of interest was clearly distinguishable. Therefore, PCR product was excised from the gel and ligated into a pGEM-T easy vector and the 5′-poly(U) size of 10 colonies was determined by sequencing using the nested forward primer (Supplementary Data).Single-cycle growth analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSConfluent BGM cell monolayers were infected with an MOI of five TCID50/cell and incubated at 36°C for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h (26). Each growth curve was performed in triplicate and viruses were released by three cycles of freezing/thawing. Virus titers were determined by endpoint titration (36).Plaque-assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSSix-well dishes with >90% confluent monolayer of BGM cells were incubated with 10-fold virus dilutions in MEM for 1 h and rocked every 15 min. After absorption, the cells were overlaid with 2.5 ml of M199 (Sigma) containing 3% FBS, 1% glutamine, 0.5% gentamicine, 0.5% penicillin, 0.5% Funguzone, 1% MgCl2 and 1.3% Na-bicarbonate in 0.6% agar (1:1 mixture with 2×M199). At 48 or 96 h p.i., cells were fixed by methanol-acetic acid (3:1, vol/vol) for 10 min and stained with a 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol.Luciferase assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSBGM cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (26) with 4 µg of replicon RNA. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed using 200 µl of CCLR lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase assay system (Promega) was used to measure the luciferase activity on a BioOrbit 1251 Luminometer.In vitro translation and replication assay ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSHeLa cell S10 extract and initiation factors were prepared as described (37). Negative strand RNA synthesis was analyzed as described (38) with minor modifications: 2 µg of CVB3 RNA transcript were mixed with 30 µl of HeLa S10 extract, 2 µl of initiation factors, 5 µl of 10× NTP/energy mix (37) and 1 µl of 100 mM guanidine-HCl in a volume of 50 µl. All other steps were executed as described (38).The 5′-poly(U) of enterovirus negative strands is significantly shorter than the 3′-poly(A) of the positive RNA strands ::: RESULTSUsing 3′-tailing and 5′-RACE reactions, we determined the lengths of the 3′-poly(A) of virion RNA and the 5′-poly(U) in (−) RNA for four different enteroviruses; CVB3, ECHO9, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) (Figure 1A and B). In all cases, the average size of the poly(A) was 80–90 nt, whereas the length of the poly(U) was only ∼20 nt (Figure 1C). The poly(A) of CVB3 RNA from purified virions recovered from different cell cultures (BGM, HeLa and COS) was of a similar average size (data not shown).OriR controls the initiation efficiency of negative RNA synthesis and the poly(A) length of virion RNA but not the size of the poly(U) of negative strands ::: RESULTSA simple explanation for the smaller size of the 5′-poly(U) tract compared with its 3′-poly(A) template is that (−) strand RNA synthesis is initiated on an internal position of the poly(A) template and there exists a spatial mechanism controlling the choice of this position. One can hypothesize that this mechanism involves the oriR. To examine this, two mutant RNAs, N70/A and N70/B, were generated, in which oriR was replaced by random sequences of 70 nt (Table 1). These RNAs proved to be viable but exhibited a reduced rate of replication [cytopathic effect (CPE) developed 4–6 days after transfection versus 2 days in the case of wild-type (wt) transcripts]. Sequencing the virus pools showed that N70/A had retained the engineered mutations while an adenosine insertion was found in N70/B within an internal oligo(A) tract downstream of the UAG stop codon (shown in bold, Table 1). The recovered viruses showed impaired replication (≥10-fold decrease in the single-cycle growth yield at 8 h p.i.) and small-plaque phenotypes (Figure 2A,B). Luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons with the 3′NCR replaced by the randomized RNA segments were assayed for RF accumulation in a cell-free system. The assay was performed with RNA transcripts containing two 5′-terminal non-viral G residues (originating from T7 RNA polymerase promoter), which suppressed (+) strand RNA synthesis, allowing thereby estimation of the (−) strand synthesis (14,38). Randomization of oriR resulted in a severe deficiency in RF accumulation (Figure 2C), suggesting impairment of the (−) strand initiation. OriR randomization also inhibited RNA replication in BGM cells, as determined by using luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons (Figure 2D). The replicon RNAs used to transfect BGM cells contained authentic 5′-ends (owing to the presence of a ribozyme sequence), improving replication kinetics (14,38). The viral RNAs extracted from virions harboring randomized oriRs possessed a markedly shortened 3′-poly(A) (30–35 nt on average) but their 5′-poly(U) on (−) RNA retained a wt length of ∼20 nt (Figure 2E).OriR controls the initiation efficiency of negative RNA synthesis and the poly(A) length of virion RNA but not the size of the poly(U) of negative strands ::: RESULTSThese data confirmed the oriR involvement in the replication of (−) strands and uncovered its role in controlling the poly(A) length of the viral RNA. On the other hand, oriR has little, if any, effect on the poly(U) length in (−) strands.Structural requirements of oriR that control the poly(A) size ::: RESULTSPrevious studies indicated that the enterovirus oriR has a conserved structure composed of helical domains joined by a kissing interaction (K) between the loops of the X- and Y-domains (Figure 3A and 3B). Disruption of this interaction by alteration of 6 nt (mutant KD1) or 4 nt (KD2) in the 3′-terminal component of the kissing interaction (Figure 3C) resulted in quasi-infectious transcripts: after a delayed CPE, viable viruses were recovered from the transfected cultures but none of them faithfully retained the engineered structure. The pseudoreversions exhibited by the viruses could be grouped into two types. The representative of one class acquired a mutation restoring potential for a stable, though altered, kissing interaction. Thus, a C insertion at position 7350 could potentially support an alternative 6 nt kissing interaction (Figure 3D). When this mutation was engineered into the KD1 RNA, a virus (KD1+C) exhibiting a nearly wt phenotype was obtained, as judged by plaque size, single-cycle growth, cell-free RF formation and luciferase expression in transfected BGM cells (data not shown). The poly(A) of the KD1+C viral RNA was ∼70 nt-long, close to the wt value (data not shown). Besides this C-insertion no other mutations were found thus far that could potentially restore the kissing interaction.Structural requirements of oriR that control the poly(A) size ::: RESULTSThe second class was represented by mutants with spontaneous deletion of both X and Y domains (Figure 3E). To investigate the significance of these domains, deletions of either X or Y, or both, or the entire heteropolymeric 3′NCR were engineered into the CVB3 RNA. The separate deletions of X or Y were engineered into p53CB3/T7 RNA, whereas more extended deletions were introduced into pRibCB3/T7, which was found to be more infectious owing to the presence of the hammerhead ribozyme sequence (14,38). All constructs tested had a poly(A) of 30 nt and generated CPE in transfected culture, though with a significant delay (Table 2). Recovered viruses retained the engineered mutations and did not acquire any additional changes within the 3′NCR. In the Δ3′NCR and ΔXY mutants, the entire genome and P3 region were sequenced, respectively, and no additional mutations were found. All these mutants exhibited a marked deficiency in the virus reproduction (Figure 4A) and a small plaque-phenotype (Figure 4B) as well as inefficient cell-free RF accumulation (Figure 4C) and RNA replication in BGM cells (Figure 4D). The mutations were also accompanied with a severe reduction in poly(A) length, to ∼45 nt (ΔX), ∼30 nt (ΔY) and ∼20 nt (Δ3′NCR) (Figure 4E). The deletion of the Z-domain alone had no significant impact on poly(A) length.Structural requirements of oriR that control the poly(A) size ::: RESULTSThese results confirmed that efficient viral RNA replication requires an oriR with a sufficiently stable kissing interaction, although the sequence of the K-domain could vary. Also, the efficient initiation of the (−) strand and generation of long poly(A) tails in the progeny (+)RNA could not be supported by its individual domains.Effect of poly(A) length on the initiation efficiency of negative-strand RNA synthesis ::: RESULTSAs assayed by cordycepin-treated transcript RNA (see Materials and Methods), the minimal poly(A) size ensuring efficient cell-free RF RNA synthesis was ∼20–30 nt (Figure 5). These results are in line with previous reports showing that a poly(A) of ∼20 nt is sufficient for the efficient replication of poliovirus (also an enterovirus) (39), whereas shorter poly(A) resulted in a dead or highly debilitated virus (2,10,31,40).Effect of poly(A) length on the initiation efficiency of negative-strand RNA synthesis ::: RESULTSThus, the minimal length of the poly(A) in the (+) RNA ensuring efficient replication is ∼20 nt, coinciding with the poly(U) length in the (−) RNA.Regeneration of RNA 3′-tails in viruses recovered from poly(A)-lacking genomes ::: RESULTSTo better understand the role of poly(A) in RNA replication, mutant viral cDNAs were generated, in which poly(A) was either missing [Δpoly(A)] or replaced by other sequences, such as G23 or C9G [Δpoly(A)-G23 and Δpoly(A)-C9G]. The Δpoly(A) construct contained 3′-terminal TCGA derived from a SalI site at the linearization locus. Transcripts of all these constructs exhibited a CPE delayed for 2–3 days and generated viruses with newly acquired 3′-poly(A), as evidenced by the ability of oligo(dT)18 to serve as a reverse primer in PCR-based sequencing. The RNA of the recovered Δpoly(A) mutant corresponded to its DNA construct, whereas the poly(G) moiety of the G23 mutant lost 21–22 G-residues and the C9G moiety of the respective mutant was replaced by a CCUUU sequence (Table 1). No alterations within the heteropolymeric part of 3′NCR was detected. The recovered viruses exhibited a nearly wt plaque phenotype at 36°C but formed somewhat smaller plaques at 39°C (Table 3). In BGM-cells, the poly(A)-lacking RNA of Δpoly(A) construct generated, at 10 h post-transfection, luciferase levels equal to ∼10% of that of wt RNA, whereas both G23 or C9G constructs produced luciferase levels similar to that found in the cells transfected with wt RNA in the presence of a potent inhibitor of viral reproduction guanidine-HCl (data not shown).Regeneration of RNA 3′-tails in viruses recovered from poly(A)-lacking genomes ::: RESULTSIn view of oriR involvement in polyadenylation of viral RNA, the effect of simultaneous deletion of heteropolymeric 3′NCR and poly(A) was investigated. When applied to the p53CB3/T7-based RNA, such a damage resulted in a nonviable genome. However, the equivalent ribozyme-containing transcript with a genuine 5′-end, Δ3′NCR-Δpoly(A), was viable, though exhibited a delayed CPE of 5 days after transfection. The viral genome acquired a 3′-poly(A) but no other modifications in the 3′-terminal portion of the molecule (Table 1).Regeneration of RNA 3′-tails in viruses recovered from poly(A)-lacking genomes ::: RESULTSTo better understand the requirements for polyadenylation of poly(A)-lacking RNA, viral genomes were generated in which the 3′NCR was replaced by various structures. The poly(A)-lacking RNA with the oriR replaced by 111 random nucleotides, Δ3′NCR-N111-Δpoly(A), acquired a 3′-poly(A) preceded by an AU-rich stretch containing a U13 element and an AAUAAA hexamer corresponding to the cellular polyadenylation signal, (Table 1). A ribozyme-lacking N70-Δpoly(A) mutant was dead. However, insertion of an AAUAAA-containing oligonucleotide into the randomized N70 sequence produced a viable virus with 3′-poly(A) preceded by a long AU-rich region containing multiple AAUAAA hexamers (Table 1). The oriR-lacking RNAs terminated with G15 or C14G (together with a SalI site-derived UCGA) also generated viable genomes in which 3′-poly(A) preceded by relatively long poly(U) tracts and an oligo(A) stretch interspersed with several single U residues, again generating AAUAAA polyadenylation-like signals (Table 1). All the recovered poly(A)-lacking viruses with 3′NCR deletion/substitution generate minute plaques (Table 3), suggesting that they had a severe defect in viral replication.Regeneration of RNA 3′-tails in viruses recovered from poly(A)-lacking genomes ::: RESULTSThe results indicated that poly(A)-lacking viral RNA can be viable but that 3′-poly(A) is readily regenerated. This poly(A) is usually, but not always, preceded by newly emerged AU-rich sequences.Genetic instability of aberrant 3′NCR in viral RNA ::: RESULTSTo understand whether the aberrant 3′NCRs could be functionally ‘improved’ by natural evolution, viruses containing such 3′NCR were subjected to additional passages. The 3′NCR of Δ3′NCR-N70/A RNA remained unchanged after five passages, although the plaque size was somewhat increased (data not shown), possibly due to alterations elsewhere in the viral RNA. Four clonal derivatives of Δ3′NCR-N70/B RNA exhibited several differences compared with the original recovered viruses and underwent further changes upon passages (Table 4). Modifications included a marked increase in the length of internal oligo(A) blocks (e.g. from 3 to 23 nt in Δ3′NCR-N70/B4) and deletions of 13 or 29 nt-long heteropolymeric segments. The virus recovered after transfection with Δ3′NCR-N111-Δpoly(A) as well as its four clonal derivatives exhibited, upon passaging, in addition to lengthening of internal poly(A), also lengthening of poly(U) and acquisition of relatively extended AU-rich sequences containing the AAUAAA hexamers (Table 4). None of these changes were accompanied by a significant increase in the plaque size.Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONThe existence of a longer poly(A) compared with its poly(U) template indicates that polyadenylation of viral RNA is not limited to the faithful copying of the template. Theoretically, additional polyadenylation may be because of either reiterative usage of the poly(U) template or a non-templated reaction catalyzed by a terminal nucleotide transferase (TNT)-like enzyme or poly(A) polymerase. Since the poly(A) is markedly shortened in the absence of oriR, the mechanism should involve this cis-element.Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONThe reiterative hypothesis (Figure 6A) assumes that the synthesis of a longer poly(A) is due to a kind of ‘stuttering’ of the viral polymerase, common to negative-strand RNA viruses (41,42). The oriR role may be envisioned as follows. The nascent oriR, just released from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) molecule engaged in the 5′-poly(U) copying, interacts with this RdRP in cis (43) and ‘encourages’ it to repeatedly use the poly(U) template. The RdRP/oriR interaction may be aided by other cellular (44) or viral proteins (45). Cases of increase in the length of internal oligo(A) in poliovirus (23,46) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (47) RNAs support the possibility of reiterative copying during picornavirus RNA replication. In this model, additional polyadenylation of viral RNA is replication-coupled, which is compatible with relative inefficiency of the RdRP complementation in trans (48,49).Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONOn the other hand, poly(A) elongation may result from 3′-terminal adenylate additions. In this case, the nascent viral RNAs has only ∼20 nt-long poly(A). Further polyadenylation is accomplished by a TNT-like enzyme activated by binding to oriR. This job may be performed by a host poly(A) polymerase (50) or the terminal adenylate transferase activity may be an intrinsic property of the viral RdRP, as reported for the poliovirus enzyme by Neufeld et al. (51). A TNT activity has also been detected in RdRP of hepatitis C virus (52).Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONThe oriR-dependent poly(A) additions to the ‘immature’ viral RNA may be post-replicative (i.e. occurring after completion of nascent positive strand transcription) (Figure 6B) or post-translational (i.e. accomplished by the nascent RdRP molecule or TNT-like enzyme) (Figure 6C). The post-translational hypothesis would explain why translation of viral RNA is a prerequisite for its replication (53). The ‘maturation’ of viral RNA through its further polyadenylation is required for its usage as template for the next round of RNA replication and also contributes to its stabilization.Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONAlso it cannot be excluded that the oriR itself controls the poly(A) length just by its stabilization.Mechanism and control of viral RNA polyadenylation ::: DISCUSSIONAlthough the above hypotheses are speculative, each of them makes specific predictions amenable for experimental testing.Control of initiation of negative strands ::: DISCUSSIONAlthough oriR is not essential for the (−) strand synthesis (29,31; this study), it is important for its efficiency. Again, several mechanisms of such a control can be considered. One may suppose that binding of the viral RdRP (within an RNP complex or otherwise) to the oriR is a prerequisite for efficient initiation of (−) RNA synthesis or that the very presence of oriR makes the poly(A) tail more accessible for the initiation complex. Either of these notions can easily be combined with the models of poly(A) elongation considered above.Control of initiation of negative strands ::: DISCUSSIONRemarkably, transcripts harboring certain oriR mutations produced progeny in which these mutations were not retained but either a wt-like oriR structure was regained or this structure was completely destroyed (see KD1 and KD2). Hence, it could be more harmful for the virus to possess certain oriR modifications than to lack this element altogether. This may indicate that some oriR modifications do not permit formation of a functional initiation complex, resulting in a dead genome.Control of initiation of negative strands ::: DISCUSSIONEven though oriR controls the efficiency of (−) RNA synthesis, it does not appear to affect the site at which this synthesis is initiated. The fixed location of this site could be explained by unavailability of other loci on the poly(A), due for example to masking by PABP (10,11), other components of the replicase complex or a higher-order RNA structure (54). Nevertheless, it is difficult to envision how the choice of the initiation site could be independent of the poly(A) size, if it is merely determined by any sort of template masking. Rather the results seem to suggest the existence of a tool able to measure the appropriate distance (∼20 nt) downstream of the heteropolymeric part of the viral RNA regardless of its sequence or structure. The nature of this tool is yet to be elucidated, but a possible role of the CRE(2C), the site of VPgpUpU synthesis utilized for (−) strand RNA synthesis, cannot be excluded (14). One may also speculate that a putative cis-element in the RdRP-coding part of the viral RNA (31) may be involved in such measurements.Control of initiation of negative strands ::: DISCUSSIONThere is still another possibility for maintaining a constant poly(U) length. Following the nidovirus example, where the (−) RNA strand is synthesized discontinuously (55,56), one may contemplate that VPg-dependent synthesis of enterovirus (−) strands starts at or near the 3′-end of the poly(A) template but after synthesizing ∼20 nt-long poly(U), the viral RdRP together with the nascent poly(U) jumps to the heteropolymer/homopolymer boundary to continue the elongation. As yet, such a mechanism for picornaviruses is not supported by any evidence.Emergency tailing of positive strands ::: DISCUSSIONEfficient enterovirus replication requires the presence of a poly(A) tail in viral RNA with a minimal length of ∼20 nt. Nevertheless, most poly(A)-lacking constructs proved to be (quasi)-infectious, generating genomes with newly-acquired AU-rich tails terminating with poly(A). Such nucleotide preference might reflect peculiarities of a yet-to-be-defined tailing reaction or merely resulted from selection because other types of tails might confer a lesser fitness. Mechanisms of elongation of the RNAs lacking poly(A) [or poly(A) and 3′NCR] are not necessarily the same as those operating in the case of wt viruses.Emergency tailing of positive strands ::: DISCUSSIONAt least for the cases, where the engineered RNA did not possess an appropriate oligoadenylate to bind, or to generate, the VPg-pUpU primer [e.g. Δ3′NCR-N70-Δpoly(A) and Δ3′NCR-N111-Δpoly(A)], it is likely that some tailing of the viral RNA occurred prior to its use as a template for the (−) strand. Such tailing may involve a TNT-like enzyme of viral or host origin or non-replicative recombination (46,57,58), or both. Participation of recombination is supported by the observed inclusion of apparently host-derived sequences identical to a part of the human heterogeneous nuclear RNP U mRNA (residues 2408–2437) into the acquired 3′-tails upon passages (data not shown).Emergency tailing of positive strands ::: DISCUSSIONPassages of viruses with altered 3′-tails resulted in further modifications, e.g. elongation of internal poly(U) and poly(A) stretches. One may hypothesize that in addition to the terminal nucleotide transfer and recombination, reiterative synthesis using either 3′ end-adjacent sequences of (+) strand or 5′ end-adjacent sequences of (−) strand as templates may be involved. It seems likely that similar aberrant tailing can occur during the wt virus infection as well, but low-fitness viruses thereby generated are readily outcompeted and become undetectable.Emergency tailing of positive strands ::: DISCUSSIONNot surprisingly, the AU-rich sequences often contain one or more canonical cellular nuclear polyadenylation signals, AAUAAA. It is unknown whether they appear just by chance or are selected because they promote recruitment of the host polyadenylation machinery. A possible contribution of the AAUAAA signals to the appearance of oligo(A) stretches in the aberrant 3′-tails of the viral RNA is supported by the finding that the addition of this signal restored viability of Δ3′NCR-N70-Δpoly(A) RNA (Table 2). Also in Bamboo Mosaic Virus it was shown that this hexameric sequence is involved in genomic RNA polyadenylation (59). Furthermore, treatment of human cells with siRNAs specific for the cellular polyA polymerase resulted in downregulation of the enzyme and inhibition of poliovirus replication (C. Polacek and R. Andino, unpublished data). The origin of the poly(U) blocks in the (+) RNA molecules is enigmatic. It cannot be excluded that they are also due to a TNT-like activity. Remarkably, these segments are often located upstream of the 3′-poly(A). Hence, if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3′-poly(A) may be added by snap-back synthesis on poly(U) blocks. However, the scarcity of experimental data makes such notion rather speculative.Emergency tailing of positive strands ::: DISCUSSIONMechanisms of the (−) RNA initiation on the abnormal 3′-tails of the genomic RNA are yet to be determined, but our data suggest that viral RNA undergoes polyadenylation prior to replication.Robustness of the viral genome ::: DISCUSSIONIlluminating examples of the robustness of the enteroviral genomes are accumulating. The oriR, a highly conserved cis-element, controls polyadenylation of the progeny RNA and initiation of the (−) strands but is nevertheless dispensable for viral viability [(29–31); this study]. Removal of poly(A), an element required for efficient genome replication, especially in combination with oriR inactivation, inflicted a severe damage to the viral fitness, though again usually not fatal. The poly(A) is functionally replaced by newly acquired AU-rich poly(A)-terminated 3′-tails potentially able to accommodate the VPg primer. Such a relatively unspecific regeneration of damaged 3′-tails of viral RNAs is not unique for enteroviruses (60).Robustness of the viral genome ::: DISCUSSIONSeveral mechanisms may be responsible for the viral robustness. First, the error-prone viral RdRP generates a variety of neutral or slightly detrimental mutants, not accumulating under normal conditions. However, ‘at emergency’, when the viral genome is severely invalidated, some of such mutations may result in a fitness increase, as exemplified by apparent restoration of the functional oriR structure after destruction of the kissing interaction [(24); this study] or changing mutual orientation of the oriR helical elements (25). Second, oriR belongs to a class of cis-elements, which are important but not essential. It is tempting to assume that such elements could have been acquired at some steps of enterovirus evolution in order to increase viral fitness. If so, the oriR-lacking mutants could be regarded as relying on ancient, ‘atavistic’ replicative tools. Regeneration of poly(A) after its complete deletion suggests the existence of unspecific mechanisms, which may ‘revive’ nearly dead viruses. Some of these mechanisms perhaps involve host enzymes.Robustness of the viral genome ::: DISCUSSIONAlthough certain RNA damages may generate rather crippled viruses, their very survival gives them chances to acquire by recombination either their lost element(s) or structurally unrelated but functionally active element from other viruses or hosts. Such loss of an element and acquisition of its functional substitute from an outside source may be an important path of viral evolution.SUPPLEMENTARY DATASupplementary Data are available at NAR Online."
Epicatechins Purified from Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Differentially Suppress Growth of Gender-Dependent Human Cancer Cell Lines,"There is accruing evidence that green tea may have anticancer activity (1), but the mechanisms for this action are poorly understood. Green tea is produced from the shrub Camellia sinensis (Fig. 1); leaves are dried but not fermented so that the green coloration attributed to polyphenols is retained. Commercially prepared green tea extracts contain ∼60% polyphenols (1). These polyphenols are the source of bioflavonoids, which have strong antioxidant activity.IntroductionThe major bioflavonoids in green tea are epicatechins. Like all bioflavonoids, the tea catechins have three hydrocarbon rings; hydroxyl molecules are found at the 3, 5, and 7 positions (Fig. 2). The four major tea catechins are epicatechin (EC), EC 3-gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG). The relative proportions of EC, ECG, EGC and EGCG in non-decaffeinated green tea are 792 ± 3, 1702 ± 16, 1695 ± 1 and 8295 ± 92 mg 100 g−1 dry wt, respectively; corresponding proportions in non-decaffeinated black tea are 240 ± 1, 761 ± 4, 1116 ± 24 and 1199 ±0.12 mg 100 g−1 dry wt (1).IntroductionEpicatechins have apparent activity against human cancer: they reportedly may promote apoptosis (2–6), arrest metastasis by inhibiting metalloproteinases (7,8), impair angiogenesis (9,10) and reverse multidrug resistance (11,12). Although all epicatechins except EC can potentially suppress cell proliferation (13–18), EGCG appears the most promising and is therefore under clinical investigation in chemoprevention trials (19). However, given the wide range in physiologic potency of the different catechins, an exclusive focus on EGCG is probably short-sighted. EGCG is reportedly more effective than EGC in decreasing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol (20) and it is the most potent catechin inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (21), but ECG has the strongest collagenase inhibitory effect (22) and the highest antioxidant potential (23). By contrast, only EGC is a potent mediator of oxidative modification and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase during hepatic catabolism of purines (24).IntroductionWe hypothesized that the in vitro anticancer action of the various catechins varies with the type and stage of malignancy. We tested this hypothesis by examining proliferation of catechin-treated cell lines derived from organ-confined or metastatic prostate cancer (CaP) and from moderately or poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The goal was to obtain data that would be useful for developing chemopreventive and therapeutic clinical trials in patients with gender-specific and non-specific solid tumors.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsFour gender-specific human cancer cell lines were used. The HH870 androgen-receptor-negative CaP cell line was developed at Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, CA, from an organ-confined primary tumor that had been resected from a 56-year-old, previously untreated Caucasian (25). This tumor was Gleason Grade 3/4, with no evidence of vascular or perineural invasion or extracapsular extension (stage T2b). The DU145 metastatic CaP cell line (American Type Culture Collection line HTB-81) was derived from a brain lesion of 69-year-old male Caucasian. It is androgen insensitive and does not express prostate-specific antigen. Two EOC cell lines developed at Hoag Cancer Center were also used: HH639 was from a poorly differentiated clear cell, Grade 3 carcinoma in the omentum and left ovary of a 56-year-old Caucasian female; HH450 was from moderately differentiated metastatic cells recovered from the abdominal fluid of a 52-year-old Asian female.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsAll four cell lines were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen freezer at −70°C. For recovery of cryopreserved cells, the vials were transferred to a 37°C water bath for 15–30 s, further thawed at room temperature and then transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube with a Pasteur pipette. An aliquot of 9 ml of RPMI-9% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added in drops. The cells were allowed to settle for 5 min and then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 300 g. Supernatant was removed, and cells were suspended in fresh RPMI, gently tapped and vortexed. Cell viability was monitored by 0.2% trypan blue dye exclusion, and cell count was determined using a hemocytometer.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsCells recovered from cryovials were grown in RPMI-1640 with glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 9% FBS, HEPES buffer, gentamycin (5 mg%) and fungizone (0.5 mg%), at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Upon confluency, cells were detached with sterile EDTA-dextrose (137 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 5.6 mM dextrose, 0.54 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), 7.1 mM sodium bicarbonate) at 37°C for 5–15 min (or ∼45 min for HH639), recovered with cold RPMI-1640-9% FBS and resuspended in the same medium. Use of trypsin was avoided for harvesting the cells. Cell viability and cell count were reassessed before cells were seeded in culture flasks.Tea Epicatechins ::: Materials and MethodsAll epicatechins used in this study (Fig. 2) were obtained from Sigma (EC, Sigma E4018; FW 290.3; ECG, Sigma E3892, FW 442.4; EGC, Sigma E3768, FW 306.3; EGC, Sigma E4143, FW 458.4) and were 98% pure as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (by the commercial source). Stock solutions were prepared under sterile conditions with 50, 60 or 100 µM of each epicatechin or with no epicatechin (control) in RPMI-1640 with glutamine (Invitrogen), 9% FBS, 0.54% HEPES buffer, gentamycin (5 mg%) and fungizone (0.5 mg%).Growth Conditions ::: Materials and MethodsAll experiments used 25 ml sterile polystyrene tissue culture flasks with a vented blue plug seal cap (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, Cat. No. 353107). Each flask contained stock solution with or without epicatechin in concentrations of 50 µM (five flasks for each epicatechin and five flasks for control) and 25, 75 and 100 µM (three flasks for each epicatechin and three flasks for control). Cells (0.25 × 106) suspended in 10 ml of the RPMI-1640-FBS solution described above were transferred to each flask and allowed to grow until control cells reached confluency. The cells were detached with sterile EDTA-dextrose at 37°C for 5 min, recovered with cold RPMI-1640-FBS medium and resuspended in the same medium.Growth Conditions ::: Materials and MethodsCells were counted using a hemocytometer; trypan blue dye exclusion was used to determine the number of viable versus dead cells. The interval between seeding and confluent growth of control cells was used to calculate the doubling time and the number of cell cycles. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each catechin in each cell line was calculated using a software program (Microcal Origin Corp, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). The cells were photographed directly from the flask using light microscopy (Olympus IX-70, Japan).Statistics ::: Materials and MethodsAnalyses of variance and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) method were used for pairwise comparisons of values significant at the 0.05 level.ECG as a Better Growth Suppressor Than EGCG: Microscopic Observations ::: ResultsOrgan-confined prostate cancer cell line HH870 and primary and metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (HH450 and HH639) seeded (2.5 × 105 cells) in flasks with or without various concentrations (25, 50, 75 or 100 µM) of ECG or EGCG were photographed under a light microscope after the untreated control cells reached confluency (Fig. 3). Both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the density of each cell line at or above 75 µM. The decrease in cell density at higher concentrations is much pronounced for ECG than for EGCG, a finding significant considering recommendations of clinical trials with EGCG (19).ECG Suppresses Viable Cell Density Better Than EGCG ::: ResultsThe mean density or viable cell number (in millions) (n =5 per treatment) of different cell lines was examined with or without catechins (50 µM) (Fig. 4). The cell density was measured when growth of untreated cells reached confluency. Statistical analysis by ANOVA as well as by pairwise comparison showed that both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the cell density. ECG decreased the cell density of prostate cancer cells DU145, HH870 and ovarian cancer cell line HH639 more potently than EGCG. But EGCG inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cell line HH450 better than ECG, suggesting the need to determine relative efficacy of ECG and EGCG in clinical trials for different cancers.Tumor Cell Doubling Time: ECG versus EGCG ::: ResultsFigure 5 shows the influence of the four epicatechins on cell doubling time. ECG and/or EGCG prolonged the doubling time of CaP cell lines DU145 and HH870 and EOC line HH450. No doubling was observed for HH639 cells treated with ECG; instead cell number decreased, indicating cell death. Table 1 summarizes the effects of EC, ECG, EGC and EGCG on viability, doubling time and cycling of the four cell lines. Untreated cells from each line reached confluency in about 2.5 cell cycles. EC did not affect the proliferation of DU145, HH870 or HH450 cells but it reduced the proliferation of HH639 cells by half (P < 0.05) and prevented their confluent growth (Table 1). EGC did not affect the proliferation of any cell line (Table 1), whereas EGCG arrested proliferation of all four lines. ECG, followed by EGCG, was the most potent inhibitor of cell growth and cycling.Dosimetric Analysis of Growth to Tumor cells: IC50 of ECG is Superior to EGCG ::: ResultsProliferation of each cell line (n = 3 per treatment) was monitored with or without ECG or EGCG at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM. The dosimetric results plotted in Fig. 6 shows concentration-dependent suppression of cell growth by ECG and EGCG. The suppressive effect on cell density was striking at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. ECG was a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than EGCG. At 25 µM of EGCG, cell numbers for HH870 and DU145 were significantly higher than control values. Based on the results plotted in Fig. 6, IC50 values were calculated. The IC50 values are 24–30 µM for ECG, versus 42–89 µM for EGCG (Table 2). ECG suppressed growth at all higher concentrations tested (Fig. 6), whereas EGCG significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced proliferation of CaP cells at 25 µM, a finding relevant to chemoprevention trials with EGCG only.DiscussionGreen tea is widely consumed in Japan and China and its polyphenolic components have a chemopreventive effect against cancer in vitro and in vivo (39). A cup of green tea contains 100–150 mg catechins, of which 8% are EC, 15% are EGC, 15% are ECG and 50% are EGCG (40). Although numerous investigations have shown the role of EGCG in cancer chemoprevention, only a few studies have attempted to compare the relative antitumor efficacy of all four catechins (Table 3). When we used a systematic approach to assess the effect of various catechins on cell lines derived from gender-based cancers, we found that each catechin's antitumor activity depended on the type of tumor. EGCG was not always the most potent chemopreventive agent.DiscussionMost of the earlier literature (Table 3) indicates that EGCG is the most potent growth inhibitor of cell lines from glioblastoma, melanoma and cancers of the breast, colon, lung, prostate (androgen-receptor-positive), pancreas, liver and mouth. EGCG prevents proliferation of DU145 cells by arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1-phase (19). Gupta and others (26) have documented that G0/G1-phase arrest is independent of p53 mutation, and EGCG treatment of DU145 induces the cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/p21. These observations suggest that EGCG imposes a cell-cycle checkpoint (19). However, our results showed that ECG may be more potent than EGCG for inhibition of primary and metastatic CaP and EOC cells (Fig. 4, Tables 1 and 2). ECG significantly reduced cell proliferation (Table 1, Figs 2 and 3) and increased mean doubling time (Table 1, Fig. 4).DiscussionThe in vitro effect of chemopreventive agents can be studied when tumor cells are in a matrix (1,4,27) or in a suspension (28,29). We used the suspension method because it exposes the entire cell surface to the chemotherapeutic agent. Our findings confirm an earlier report that used the matrix method to show that ECG is more potent than EGCG in suppressing the proliferation of DU145 CaP cells (4). Thus reported differences in the relative efficacy of different catechins may not be due to differences in methodology.DiscussionNot all tumor cells are killed by catechins. In our study, ECG (50 µM) induced death of most but not all HH639 cells. Doubling ECG's IC50 concentration might increase the tumor kill rate if ECG does not epimerize to CG. Our in vitro dose of 100 µM is equivalent to 29 mg (EC/EGC) to 45 mg (EGCG/ECG), far less than the 100–150 mg (50% of which is EGCG) in one cup of green tea. However, Lee et al. (41) reported that plasma levels of EGCG and EGC in healthy volunteers increased to 78 and 223 ng ml−1, respectively, 20 min after drinking brewed green tea (1.2 g of tea solids in 200 ml hot water). This suggests that drinking more than 10 cups of green tea may be necessary to maintain a plasma concentration of EGCG equivalent to that used in vitro by a dose of 50 µM or 22.5 mg. Kaegi (42) suggested a daily intake of 13 cups of green tea as a chemopreventive measure. Because this level of tea consumption is impractically high, chemoprevention of cancer with catechins may require administration of the appropriate catechin in a purified form.DiscussionIn conclusion it may be stated that both green and black tea polyphenols are important components of antitumor aspect of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which play a significant role in the American health care system and in patients who suffer from chronic problems (43). While green tea catechin gallates such as EGCG and ECG possess potent antitumor activities, their epimers, commonly found in black tea, act as potent inhibitor of proteases involved in replication of viruses, including coronoviruses (44). There is a need to understand preventive and therapeutic potential of catechin gallates from both green and black teas. We are currently designing a phase I chemopreventive study to examine the effects of purified EGCG and ECG in patients who have been chosen observational management of organ-confined prostate cancer."
Human metapneumovirus infection in children hospitalized for wheezing,"There is accruing evidence that green tea may have anticancer activity (1), but the mechanisms for this action are poorly understood. Green tea is produced from the shrub Camellia sinensis (Fig. 1); leaves are dried but not fermented so that the green coloration attributed to polyphenols is retained. Commercially prepared green tea extracts contain ∼60% polyphenols (1). These polyphenols are the source of bioflavonoids, which have strong antioxidant activity.IntroductionThe major bioflavonoids in green tea are epicatechins. Like all bioflavonoids, the tea catechins have three hydrocarbon rings; hydroxyl molecules are found at the 3, 5, and 7 positions (Fig. 2). The four major tea catechins are epicatechin (EC), EC 3-gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG). The relative proportions of EC, ECG, EGC and EGCG in non-decaffeinated green tea are 792 ± 3, 1702 ± 16, 1695 ± 1 and 8295 ± 92 mg 100 g−1 dry wt, respectively; corresponding proportions in non-decaffeinated black tea are 240 ± 1, 761 ± 4, 1116 ± 24 and 1199 ±0.12 mg 100 g−1 dry wt (1).IntroductionEpicatechins have apparent activity against human cancer: they reportedly may promote apoptosis (2–6), arrest metastasis by inhibiting metalloproteinases (7,8), impair angiogenesis (9,10) and reverse multidrug resistance (11,12). Although all epicatechins except EC can potentially suppress cell proliferation (13–18), EGCG appears the most promising and is therefore under clinical investigation in chemoprevention trials (19). However, given the wide range in physiologic potency of the different catechins, an exclusive focus on EGCG is probably short-sighted. EGCG is reportedly more effective than EGC in decreasing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol (20) and it is the most potent catechin inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (21), but ECG has the strongest collagenase inhibitory effect (22) and the highest antioxidant potential (23). By contrast, only EGC is a potent mediator of oxidative modification and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase during hepatic catabolism of purines (24).IntroductionWe hypothesized that the in vitro anticancer action of the various catechins varies with the type and stage of malignancy. We tested this hypothesis by examining proliferation of catechin-treated cell lines derived from organ-confined or metastatic prostate cancer (CaP) and from moderately or poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The goal was to obtain data that would be useful for developing chemopreventive and therapeutic clinical trials in patients with gender-specific and non-specific solid tumors.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsFour gender-specific human cancer cell lines were used. The HH870 androgen-receptor-negative CaP cell line was developed at Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, CA, from an organ-confined primary tumor that had been resected from a 56-year-old, previously untreated Caucasian (25). This tumor was Gleason Grade 3/4, with no evidence of vascular or perineural invasion or extracapsular extension (stage T2b). The DU145 metastatic CaP cell line (American Type Culture Collection line HTB-81) was derived from a brain lesion of 69-year-old male Caucasian. It is androgen insensitive and does not express prostate-specific antigen. Two EOC cell lines developed at Hoag Cancer Center were also used: HH639 was from a poorly differentiated clear cell, Grade 3 carcinoma in the omentum and left ovary of a 56-year-old Caucasian female; HH450 was from moderately differentiated metastatic cells recovered from the abdominal fluid of a 52-year-old Asian female.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsAll four cell lines were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen freezer at −70°C. For recovery of cryopreserved cells, the vials were transferred to a 37°C water bath for 15–30 s, further thawed at room temperature and then transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube with a Pasteur pipette. An aliquot of 9 ml of RPMI-9% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added in drops. The cells were allowed to settle for 5 min and then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 300 g. Supernatant was removed, and cells were suspended in fresh RPMI, gently tapped and vortexed. Cell viability was monitored by 0.2% trypan blue dye exclusion, and cell count was determined using a hemocytometer.Human Cancer Cell Lines ::: Materials and MethodsCells recovered from cryovials were grown in RPMI-1640 with glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 9% FBS, HEPES buffer, gentamycin (5 mg%) and fungizone (0.5 mg%), at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Upon confluency, cells were detached with sterile EDTA-dextrose (137 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 5.6 mM dextrose, 0.54 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), 7.1 mM sodium bicarbonate) at 37°C for 5–15 min (or ∼45 min for HH639), recovered with cold RPMI-1640-9% FBS and resuspended in the same medium. Use of trypsin was avoided for harvesting the cells. Cell viability and cell count were reassessed before cells were seeded in culture flasks.Tea Epicatechins ::: Materials and MethodsAll epicatechins used in this study (Fig. 2) were obtained from Sigma (EC, Sigma E4018; FW 290.3; ECG, Sigma E3892, FW 442.4; EGC, Sigma E3768, FW 306.3; EGC, Sigma E4143, FW 458.4) and were 98% pure as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (by the commercial source). Stock solutions were prepared under sterile conditions with 50, 60 or 100 µM of each epicatechin or with no epicatechin (control) in RPMI-1640 with glutamine (Invitrogen), 9% FBS, 0.54% HEPES buffer, gentamycin (5 mg%) and fungizone (0.5 mg%).Growth Conditions ::: Materials and MethodsAll experiments used 25 ml sterile polystyrene tissue culture flasks with a vented blue plug seal cap (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, Cat. No. 353107). Each flask contained stock solution with or without epicatechin in concentrations of 50 µM (five flasks for each epicatechin and five flasks for control) and 25, 75 and 100 µM (three flasks for each epicatechin and three flasks for control). Cells (0.25 × 106) suspended in 10 ml of the RPMI-1640-FBS solution described above were transferred to each flask and allowed to grow until control cells reached confluency. The cells were detached with sterile EDTA-dextrose at 37°C for 5 min, recovered with cold RPMI-1640-FBS medium and resuspended in the same medium.Growth Conditions ::: Materials and MethodsCells were counted using a hemocytometer; trypan blue dye exclusion was used to determine the number of viable versus dead cells. The interval between seeding and confluent growth of control cells was used to calculate the doubling time and the number of cell cycles. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each catechin in each cell line was calculated using a software program (Microcal Origin Corp, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). The cells were photographed directly from the flask using light microscopy (Olympus IX-70, Japan).Statistics ::: Materials and MethodsAnalyses of variance and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) method were used for pairwise comparisons of values significant at the 0.05 level.ECG as a Better Growth Suppressor Than EGCG: Microscopic Observations ::: ResultsOrgan-confined prostate cancer cell line HH870 and primary and metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (HH450 and HH639) seeded (2.5 × 105 cells) in flasks with or without various concentrations (25, 50, 75 or 100 µM) of ECG or EGCG were photographed under a light microscope after the untreated control cells reached confluency (Fig. 3). Both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the density of each cell line at or above 75 µM. The decrease in cell density at higher concentrations is much pronounced for ECG than for EGCG, a finding significant considering recommendations of clinical trials with EGCG (19).ECG Suppresses Viable Cell Density Better Than EGCG ::: ResultsThe mean density or viable cell number (in millions) (n =5 per treatment) of different cell lines was examined with or without catechins (50 µM) (Fig. 4). The cell density was measured when growth of untreated cells reached confluency. Statistical analysis by ANOVA as well as by pairwise comparison showed that both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the cell density. ECG decreased the cell density of prostate cancer cells DU145, HH870 and ovarian cancer cell line HH639 more potently than EGCG. But EGCG inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cell line HH450 better than ECG, suggesting the need to determine relative efficacy of ECG and EGCG in clinical trials for different cancers.Tumor Cell Doubling Time: ECG versus EGCG ::: ResultsFigure 5 shows the influence of the four epicatechins on cell doubling time. ECG and/or EGCG prolonged the doubling time of CaP cell lines DU145 and HH870 and EOC line HH450. No doubling was observed for HH639 cells treated with ECG; instead cell number decreased, indicating cell death. Table 1 summarizes the effects of EC, ECG, EGC and EGCG on viability, doubling time and cycling of the four cell lines. Untreated cells from each line reached confluency in about 2.5 cell cycles. EC did not affect the proliferation of DU145, HH870 or HH450 cells but it reduced the proliferation of HH639 cells by half (P < 0.05) and prevented their confluent growth (Table 1). EGC did not affect the proliferation of any cell line (Table 1), whereas EGCG arrested proliferation of all four lines. ECG, followed by EGCG, was the most potent inhibitor of cell growth and cycling.Dosimetric Analysis of Growth to Tumor cells: IC50 of ECG is Superior to EGCG ::: ResultsProliferation of each cell line (n = 3 per treatment) was monitored with or without ECG or EGCG at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM. The dosimetric results plotted in Fig. 6 shows concentration-dependent suppression of cell growth by ECG and EGCG. The suppressive effect on cell density was striking at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. ECG was a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than EGCG. At 25 µM of EGCG, cell numbers for HH870 and DU145 were significantly higher than control values. Based on the results plotted in Fig. 6, IC50 values were calculated. The IC50 values are 24–30 µM for ECG, versus 42–89 µM for EGCG (Table 2). ECG suppressed growth at all higher concentrations tested (Fig. 6), whereas EGCG significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced proliferation of CaP cells at 25 µM, a finding relevant to chemoprevention trials with EGCG only.DiscussionGreen tea is widely consumed in Japan and China and its polyphenolic components have a chemopreventive effect against cancer in vitro and in vivo (39).

Novel insights into the aetiology and pathophysiology of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations,"Exacerbations are a cardinal feature of the natural history of moderate and severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)[1]. Patients with frequent exacerbations have significantly lower quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality rates [1-4]. Although the effect of COPD exacerbations on lung function has been questioned in the past, recent evidence suggests that exacerbations accelerate long-term decline in lung function, specifically in smokers [5-7]. The mechanism of this acceleration remains largely unknown.BackgroundTreatment decisions for COPD patients are frequently made according to exacerbation rates. In the ATS/ERS guidelines it is stated that patients with frequent exacerbations should be initiated a trial of inhaled steroids[8]. Systemic steroids should be administered during acute COPD exacerbations, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. These treatment strategies indicate the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of exacerbations.BackgroundAlthough evidence for increased inflammation on COPD exacerbations has been reviewed previously, there has been little focus on why inflammation increases and which the consequences of this increase are[9,10]. Investigating further these important questions may help establish a cause and effect relationship between inflammation and COPD exacerbations. The primary aim of this review is to summarize emerging explanations for why inflammation is increased during COPD exacerbations. For practical purposes an attempt is made to categorize aetiological factors of increased inflammation into extrinsic or intrinsic, as it can be seen in table 1. A secondary aim is to try to explain how increased inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations.1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsBacterial infections are generally considered to be the most common causes of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 40% of all exacerbations are of bacterial origin[9,11,12]. Accordingly, antibiotics should be administered in inpatients and outpatients with acute COPD exacerbation and changes in sputum characteristics suggestive of bacterial infection[8].1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsThe most common bacteria connected to COPD exacerbations are non-typable H. Influenzae, S. Pneumoniae, and M. Cattarhalis[9,11,12]. The same bacteria often colonize the nasal mucosa and pharynx of healthy individuals, but in smokers and in patients with COPD impaired mucocilliary clearance and innate immunity allow these pathogens to colonize the lower airways[13]. COPD exacerbations may be triggered by the acquisition of a new bacterial species or by an increase in the absolute number of the same bacteria that colonize the airways or by the acquisition of a different strain from the same bacterial species [14-16].1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAirway bacteria initiate airway inflammation through several interconnecting mechanisms. The surface of bacteria allows the complement system to be activated through the alternative pathway, while specific surface molecules of the bacteria, called Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), bind to pattern recognition receptors on a variety of leukocytes and initiate signalling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB and production of proinflammatory cytokines[17]. Once activated, innate immunity can trigger both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated adaptive immune responses. This cascade of events leads to increased blood flow to tissue, increased temperature, redness and swelling which characterize inflammation.1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsA significant number of studies in stable COPD patients suggest that airway bacterial infections are associated with increased airway inflammation(18–21). Finding a relationship between bacteria and inflammation on stable COPD adds weight to the argument that bacteria may play a causative role in airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations.1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsSoler et al used protected specimen brush and bronchoalveolar lavage sampling to determine inflammatory cell counts, levels of cytokines concentrations and microbial patterns in stable COPD patients and found that increased neutrophils and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels may be related to bronchial colonization[18]. Increased TNF-alpha, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels have been specifically related with H. Influenzae infection, as shown by Bresser et al[19]. However, in that study all mediators were measured in frozen sputum and MPO and IL-8 levels were only retrospectively compared to non-infected patients. In fresh sputum samples from COPD patients R. Stockley and his group demonstrated that MPO, neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, IL-8 and LTB4 levels are positively related to sputum bacterial load[20]. Moreover, the type of organism affected sputum MPO levels and NE activity; MPO levels were relatively increased in the presence of Ps. Aeruginosa compared to H. Influenzae and to M. Catarrhalis. There have been also reports for decreased secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in sputum samples from COPD patients colonised with bacteria[20,21]. Upper airways inflammation in COPD is also increased when there is bacterial colonization[22]. All these results taken together suggest that bacteria are actively involved in the mechanisms of increased inflammation in stable COPD. It would be logical to assume a similar association for COPD exacerbations.1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsA large prospective longitudinal study by Sethi et al addressed the hypothesis that patients with bacterial-positive exacerbations show increased inflammation compared to bacterial-negative exacerbations[23]. Among H. Influenzae, H. Parainfluenzae and M. Catarrhalis positive exacerbations, H. Influenzae and M. Catarrhalis demonstrated higher sputum TNF-alpha and NE levels compared to bacterial-negative exacerbations. Moreover, increased NE levels above a certain level could distinguish bacterial from non-bacterial exacerbations with 71% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Others have failed to report any difference in sputum NE levels and other fluid-phase mediators between patients with H. Influenzae exacerbations or bacterial-negative exacerbations[24]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in sputum induction time or in sputum processing or in the assays used for the detection of fluid-phase mediators. Another intriguing hypothesis is that different strains of the same pathogens may induce different levels of inflammation and subjects taking part in different studies might have been infected by different strains of H. Influenzae. It was recently shown that H. Influenzae strains isolated from COPD patients during exacerbation induce more inflammation than strains of the same pathogen isolated from colonizers[16]. The close association between airway infections and increased inflammation during COPD exacerbations has been further confirmed by a report of increased systemic inflammation in infected patients during exacerbation[25].1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsConsistent with these observations, airway inflammation can be decreased with treatment of the infection. Early evidence came from a relatively small study, which showed that neutrophilic mediators' levels may decrease after treatment of bacterial exacerbations[26]. Gompertz et al confirmed that there are significant decreases in neutrophilic inflammatory mediators after treatment of purulent exacerbations[27]. Most importantly, White et al studied patients with bacterial exacerbations and demonstrated a significant fall in sputum leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels and an increase in SLPI levels in patients in whom bacteria were eradicated, but not in those in whom bacteria persisted on stable state[24]. Moreover, MPO and LTB4 levels were significantly lower and SLPI levels significantly higher in patients with treated compared to patients with untreated bacterial infections on stable state.1a Bacterial infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsIn conclusion, three major findings support the hypothesis that bacterial infections are actively implicated in the mechanisms of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations: 1) bacterial infections increase airway inflammation in colonized stable COPD patients 2) bacterial-positive exacerbations show increased inflammation (particularly of neutrophilic type) compared to bacterial-negative exacerbations and 3) eradication of bacteria after a bacterial exacerbation is accompanied by a significant decrease in airway inflammation. A summary of these findings is presented in table 2.1b Viral infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsRespiratory viruses are important triggers of COPD exacerbations. Initial studies using serology and cell cultures for detecting viral infections suggested that 30% of COPD exacerbations are related to viral infections [28-30]. Later studies using the more sensitive method of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that 40%–50% of COPD exacerbations may be secondary to viral infection[31,32]. Rhinoviruses, picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B and coronaviruses are more frequently detected[31,32].1b Viral infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsPossible mechanisms of viral-induced inflammation have been described. The airway epithelial cell is the principal host cell for most respiratory viruses[33]. Viral replication in the epithelial cell triggers intracellular signalling pathways, including activation of NFκB, which leads to increases in the secretion of multiple cytokines and recruitment of multiple leukocytes to the airways[33]. Antigen presenting cells are of particular importance, because binding of viruses to these cells induces innate and adaptive immune responses and T lymphocyte activation[34].1b Viral infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsThere is convincing data that viruses induce inflammation in asthma[35]. In animal models of emphysema, latent adenoviral infection amplifies the emphysematous destruction and increases the inflammatory response[36]. In stable COPD latent adenoviral infection has been associated with severe emphysema and increased inflammation[37]. The group of J Wedzicha showed that viral infections might be implicated in the mechanisms of increased airway and possibly systemic inflammation during COPD exacerbations. Plasma IL-6 and fibrinogen levels were higher during viral than non-viral exacerbations, although the difference just failed to reach statistical significance[31]. However, in that study viruses were detected in nasal samples and it has been shown that in COPD patients respiratory viruses are detected more frequently in induced sputum than in nasal lavage[32,38]. When rhinovirus infection was detected in induced sputum samples a significant correlation was demonstrated between rhinovirus infection and increased sputum IL-6 levels on COPD exacerbations[38].1b Viral infections ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsFurther to these observations, two recent studies showed that viral airway infections during COPD exacerbations are related to airway eosinophilia[39,40]. This new finding may be of particular clinical importance as airway eosinophilia could be used as an indicator of viral infection during an exacerbation. The important role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations is further supported by studies in bronchial biopsies and sputum samples, which show increased eosinophil numbers and eosinophil mediators in COPD patients during exacerbations [41-46]. Eosinophils may be actively involved in the pathogenesis of viral-induced COPD exacerbations through the release of destructive enzymes, reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators.1c Atypical bacteria ::: 1. Airway infections ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAtypical pathogens with potential importance in acute exacerbations include M. Pneumoniae, C. Pneumoniae and Legionella spp. Considerable confusion exists in the literature regarding the significance of these potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of COPD[47]. This is partly due to differences in the techniques used to detect the presence of atypical infections. When a fourfold increase in antibody titter or a positive culture or RT-PCR is used, M. Pneumoniae and Legionella are rare and C. Pneumoniae infection may be involved in up to 9% of COPD exacerbations[30,48-50]. Moreover, chronic colonization with C. Pneumoniae may be associated with a higher rate of COPD exacerbations[51]. C. Pneumonia infection can amplify inflammation in the airways of COPD patients by stimulating the production and expression of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules[52]. However, clear evidence showing a direct relationship between increased inflammation and C. Pneumoniae infection during COPD exacerbations is yet lacking[50].2. Increased air pollution ::: Extrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsEpidemiologists have linked ambient particulate air pollution (PM) exposure with exacerbations of pre-existing pulmonary diseases, such as COPD[53]. PM-mediated enhancement of airway inflammation is a central pathogenetic mechanism by which PM exposure leads to exacerbation of inflammatory pulmonary diseases [54-56]. It has been suggested that PM exposure induces lung inflammation by an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species[57,58]. To the best of our knowledge there are no in vivo studies on the effect of PM exposure on airway inflammation in COPD patients. There is also lack of information on airway inflammation during PM exposure induced COPD exacerbations, which may be due to difficulties in defining such exacerbations.1. Increased oxidative stress ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAn imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants may be involved in the development of COPD exacerbations. Almost a decade ago Rahman et al showed that plasma Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity is decreased in patients presenting with acute exacerbation of COPD[59]. Recent reports suggest that 8-isoprostane levels are increased in exhaled breath condensate of COPD patients during exacerbations, while levels of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione(GSH) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are decreased[60,61]. Oxidative stress may be closely associated to increased inflammation during exacerbations[60,62].1. Increased oxidative stress ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsOxidant stimuli induce cellular expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and heme-oxygenase-1(HO-1) and increase nitrotyrosine formation. We have shown that there is increased HO-1 expression and nitrotyrosine formation in the airways of COPD patients during severe exacerbations relatively to stable state and that this is accompanied by an increase in indices of neutrophilic inflammation, i.e. neutrophil numbers, MPO and IL-8 levels[62]. Evidence for a close association between oxidative stress, airway neutrophilia and increased IL-8 during severe COPD exacerbations is also supported by Drost et al[60]. A certain limitation in the study by Drost et al is the fact that different patients were examined on exacerbation and on stable state.1. Increased oxidative stress ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsOxidative stress induces the transcription of various inflammatory factors, such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1)[63]. It has been shown that NF-κB DNA binding in sputum inflammatory cells is increased during COPD exacerbations[64]. Other investigators have reported increased nuclear localisation of p65, which is a signal of NF-κB activation, in sputum macrophages during COPD exacerbations[65]. NF-κB is important for transcription of IL-8 gene and oxidative stress may induce or amplify airway neutrophilia by inducing the transcription of IL-8 gene[66]. In support of this hypothesis both we and Drost et al have found increased IL-8 levels and neutrophil numbers associated with increased oxidative stress on severe COPD exacerbations[60,62].1. Increased oxidative stress ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsActivated neutrophils and other inflammatory cells can in turn release reactive oxygen species and increase airway oxidative stress. Because oxidative stress can induce inflammation and vice versa, it is not clear which of the two, oxidative stress or inflammation, is primarily involved in the mechanisms of COPD exacerbations-[the chicken and egg problem].2. Altered immunity ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAlterations in innate and adaptive immunity are implicated in COPD pathogenesis[67]. Evidence favouring participation of the adaptive immune response in COPD includes the several reports of increased numbers of T-lymphocytes, specifically CD8+ve T-cells with a ""type 1""profile [68-71]. It is still unknown whether these alterations are triggered by cigarette smoking, viral infections, or there is a genetic predisposal. We have recently shown that CD8+ve T lymphocytes may mediate their destructive effects in COPD through increased perforin expression and cytotoxic activity[72]. It would be reasonable to assume that lymphocytes may be implicated in the mechanisms of increased inflammation during COPD exacerbations.2. Altered immunity ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAccording to our observations changes in lymphocyte subpopulations occur during severe COPD exacerbations[73]. In specific, there is a further increase in CD8+ve T cells and this is rather associated with increased CD8+ve type 2 cells compared to type 1. This finding suggests that Tc1 and Tc2 responses may fluctuate in relation to the different phase (exacerbation versus stable state) of the disease in the same patient. Similar observations have been made in other inflammatory diseases[74]. A relative increase of Tc2 versus Tc1 cells may result in impaired immunity, increased susceptibility to viral infections and increased inflammation [75-77].2. Altered immunity ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsAlthough Saetta et al also found increased T cell numbers in endobronchial biopsies from chronic bronchitis patients on mild exacerbations, no difference was detected in CD4 or CD8+ve cell numbers[45]. This discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that we examined sputum samples (not biopsies) from COPD patients (not chronic bronchitis) on severe exacerbation (not mild exacerbation). Moreover, Saetta et al compared different patients on exacerbation and on stable state, which could be a limitation in their study. However, finding increased T cell numbers still adds evidence to the argument that immune responses may be involved in the mechanisms of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations.3. Increased baseline levels of inflammation ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsIt would be logical to assume that small increases in airway inflammation in patients with already increased baseline levels of inflammation can easily trigger a COPD exacerbation. This presumes the existence of an inflammatory threshold, above which exacerbation occurs. In relation to this hypothesis, Bhowmik et al showed that COPD patients with frequent exacerbations (≥ 3 episodes/year) have increased baseline sputum IL-6 and IL-8 levels[78]. However, it was not examined whether this was related to bacterial colonization, as bacterial colonization can increase airway inflammation and exacerbation rates. The same group also showed faster rises over time in plasma fibrinogen and sputum IL-6 in patients with frequent exacerbations[79].3. Increased baseline levels of inflammation ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsOn the contrary, Gombertz et al did not detect any difference in neutrophilic mediators (including IL-8) between frequent (≥ 3 episodes/year) and infrequent exacerbators[80]. Interestingly, when patients with bronchiectasis were excluded from the analysis, SLPI was found to be lower in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, which suggests that COPD patients with bronchiectasis may represent a distinct group. Fujimoto et al also report no difference in baseline IL-8 and markers of eosinophilic inflammation between stable and unstable COPD patients[42]. However, results between this and other studies are not comparable due to lower exacerbation rates (mean 1 episode/year) in the unstable COPD group in this study.3. Increased baseline levels of inflammation ::: Intrinsic factors ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsIn conclusion, data relating baseline airway inflammation to exacerbation frequency are rather controversial. Part of the existing confusion may be due to significant heterogeneity among COPD patients and to the existence of several factors, like bacterial colonization and bronchiectasis that may increase airway inflammation. In particular, COPD patients with bronchiectasis may represent a distinct group characterized by higher rates of bacterial colonization, increased baseline levels of airway inflammation and longer symptom recovery times at exacerbation[81].Inflammation and pathophysiology of exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsEpisodes of COPD exacerbations are characterized by an acute increase in a patient's baseline dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum production[8]. Severe exacerbations are also associated with worsening of pulmonary gas exchange that may lead to hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia[82]. In order to support a role for airway inflammation in COPD exacerbations the mechanisms which are induced by airway inflammation need to be related to the symptoms and pathophysiology of exacerbations.Inflammation and pathophysiology of exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsIncreased airway inflammation induces many pathologic changes on the airways. Accumulation of inflammatory cells in the airway mucosa by itself causes airway wall thickening. Inflammatory cells can release potentially harmful mediators, such as proteases and reactive oxygen species[83]. Neutrophil and eosinophil products, like MPO, NE and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), have been found increased on exacerbations, and can cause inflammatory damage and increased permeability of the bronchial mucosa, resulting in airway oedema and protein exudation[20,42,62,84]. Inflammatory mediators, like ECP, can also induce bronchoconstriction by increasing achetinocholine release from parasynmpathetic nerves, while others, like NE, increase mucus secretion[85,86]. Furthermore, mediators of inflammation enhance coughing[87]. Potentially harmful mediators may be released not only by inflammatory cells but also by resident cells. For example, endothelin (ET)-1, which has been found increased on exacerbations, can be released by epithelial cells and stimulates mucus secretion and bronchial hyperesponsiveness[50]. The cascade of the above events leads to significant airway narrowing and increased airway secretions, while the patient suffers from increased cough, sputum, and/or increased dyspnea. The mechanisms of dyspnea are not entirely understood yet, but may be also associated with excessive airway narrowing and dynamic hyperinflation due to increased inflammation [88-90].Inflammation and pathophysiology of exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsA brief summary of the pathophysiologic events that may link airway inflammation to the symptoms of COPD exacerbations and to respiratory failure is given in figure 1. Airway narrowing, caused by increased inflammation, leads to expiratory flow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation. Dynamic hyperinflation in turn increases work of respiratory muscles and oxygen consumption, resulting in decreased mixed venous oxygen tension[91]. Airway narrowing also increases ventilation/perfusion inequality, because a greater proportion of blood flow is diverted through lung units with low V'/Q' ratios[91]. The combination of increased ventilation/perfusion inequality and decreased mixed venous oxygen tension significantly worsen gas exchange in patients with severe COPD exacerbations.Inflammation and pathophysiology of exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsIncreased airway inflammation would be also expected to increase lung tissue oxygen demand and oxygen consumption. In patients with acute lung injury no relation has been found between pulmonary oxygen consumption and lung inflammation, but there is no relevant data in COPD exacerbations[92].Anti-inflammatory therapy for exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsDespite the increasing recognition of the importance of airway inflammation in the development of COPD exacerbations, there is still confusion regarding the role of anti-inflammatory strategies in the prevention and treatment of COPD exacerbations[93,94]. There are studies showing a beneficial effect of inhaled steroids in preventing COPD exacerbations and systemic steroids in treating acute exacerbations, however the overall benefits for COPD patients in these studies are generally modest [95-97]. Considering that inflammation in stable COPD is steroid resistant, this should not come as a great surprise[98]. Although the majority of COPD patients respond modestly to steroid therapy, there might be subgroup of patients, those with eosinophilic pattern of inflammation during exacerbations that may benefit the most from steroid administration. There is already evidence that stable patients with high sputum eosinophil counts are steroid responsive, but there is no relevant data on COPD exacerbations[99,100]. Identifying patients that may benefit from systemic steroid administration during exacerbations is of great importance, due to the serious adverse events frequently observed with this kind of treatment[97].Anti-inflammatory therapy for exacerbations ::: Aetiology of increased inflammation on exacerbationsOther drugs with anti-inflammatory properties, like methylxanthines and mucolytic agents seem not to be effective on COPD exacerbations[8]. B-agonists are mainly administered as bronchodilators, although they may also have an anti-inflammatory role[101]. Novel drugs aimed at inhibiting targets, including NO synthase, phosphodiesterase 4, proteases and various inflammatory mediators have not been tested during exacerbations yet.ConclusionIt has been long postulated that airway inflammation may be increased during COPD exacerbations and this may be involved in the pathophysiology of exacerbations. There is now sufficient data to support such a hypothesis. Firstly, there are accumulating observations for increased inflammation during COPD exacerbations. Secondly, specific aetiological factors for this increase have been identified. Thirdly, possible mechanisms that may link airway inflammation with the pathophysiology of exacerbations have been unmasked. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of inflammation in COPD exacerbations, the existing anti-inflammatory treatments remain modest and there is little overall benefit for the patient. Further research is needed to target therapies to the appropriate patient populations and to develop new therapeutic strategies.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Microarray-based identification of antigenic variants of foot-and-mouth disease virus: a bioinformatics quality assessment,"The control of diseases associated with highly variable RNA viruses requires close monitoring of the variant virus types that periodically dominate in viral populations. This is due to high mutation rates, quasispecies dynamics and population bottlenecks that often accompany virus transmission [reviewed in [1]]. Indeed, RNA viruses replicate with mutation rates in the range of 10-3 to 10-5 substitutions per nucleotide copied [2,3]. As a consequence, RNA virus populations consist of complex and dynamic distributions of related genomes termed viral quasispecies [4,5]. Viral quasispecies can influence viral pathogenesis [6-8], and the response to antiviral treatments [9]. Mutant clouds in infected organisms represent the first stage in the natural genetic and antigenic diversification of viruses [8,10]. A consequence which is relevant to viral diagnosis and surveillance is that a transmission bottleneck may result in the establishment in the recipient host of one (or few) variant(s) sampled from the mutant cloud that replicates in the infected donor. Therefore, methodology to discern among minor variants of the same viral genotype or serotype is essential for epidemiological surveillance and the planning of disease control strategies.BackgroundAn important animal pathogen which participates of quasispecies dynamics, transmission bottlenecks, and the potential for rapid evolution is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the etiological agent of the economically most devastating disease of farm animals [recent reviews in [11]]. FMDV is an aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae, whose genome is a single stranded RNA of about 8200 nucleotides, of positive polarity, replicated by a virus-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, devoid of a proofreading-repair activity [12]. The antigenic variation of FMDV is a direct consequence of its genetic variation during natural infections, confirmed by many experiments in vivo and in cell culture [11,13]. Inactivated virus vaccines are used to control FMD, but their efficacy is limited by the antigenic variation of the virus [11]. The antigenic diversity of FMDV is reflected in the occurrence of seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3), and multiple subtypes and variants that defy classification due to the continuous recognition of mutant forms in replicating FMDV quasispecies [14]. In vaccination-challenge experiments no cross-protection is observed among representatives of a different serotype, and only partial protection among some subtypes and variants [11]. Therefore, continuous monitoring of circulating antigenic forms is required to prepare vaccines whose antigenic composition matches that of the circulating virus [11].BackgroundAntigenic variants of FMDV have been classically diagnosed by immunological methods (complement fixation, ELISA, neutralization of infectivity) [review in [15]]. Recently, several methods based on reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification have been adapted to the diagnosis of FMDV [16]. Some of these methods can be applied without the need to grow the virus in cell culture. More recently, a FMD DNA chip containing 155 oligonucleotide probes to detect simultaneously the seven FMDV serotypes has been described [17]. Several studies have documented that long oligonucleotide DNA microarrays can detect simultaneously many viral pathogens [18]. Multiple oligoprobes were used to characterize the heterogeneous composition and recombination forms of human poliovirus [19]. These results encourage the development of a new microarray-based approach to probe the fine genetic and antigenic composition of FMDV for diagnosis, vaccine design, and to gain insight into the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen.BackgroundA major antigenic site of FMDV (termed site A) is located at the mobile, exposed G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 [13,20,21]. This loop includes several epitopes involved in binding of neutralizing antibodies, as well as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) triplet that participates in recognition of integrin receptors [21,22]. The overlap of residues involved in receptor recognition and antibody binding implies that variations at the G-H loop of VP1 can have consequences both for the antigenic behavior of the virus and its host range [23,24]. For FMDV of serotype C multiple variants at the epitopes located within antigenic site A were documented among natural populations of the virus. Furthermore, studies in cell culture have shown that FMDV can evolve towards variants with altered RGD that display a remarkable expansion of host cell tropism [25]. The several biological implications of the G-H loop of VP1 prompted us to develop a DNA oligonucleotide microarray to probe multiple genetic variants of FMDV, around VP1 residues 139 to 147 (Figure 1). We report assay conditions that have been optimized to detect the presence of several point mutants at this major antigenic site of FMDV, and develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based procedure to automatize sample classification hybridization intensities and to set up limits for reliable diagnosis.Specificity and sensitivity optimization of FMDV microarray ::: ResultsIn a first approach, 8 DNA oligonucleotides were designed for the set up of an FMDV microarray. They represent RNA sequences encoding the G-H (VP1) loop of C-S8c1 FMDV. Two variants (encoding RGD and RED at VP1 positions 141–143) (Figures 1 and 2) of FMDV were initially tested. A microarray with both FMDV variants was printed to analyze the influence of long (15-mer) versus short (11-mer) oligonucleotides, the presence or absence of (dT)15 spacers, and the oligonucleotide concentration. A number of conclusions were drawn from the results (not shown). First, the hybridization signals were weaker with oligonucleotides of 11 residues than with oligonucleotides of 15 residues. We have not assessed oligonucleotides longer than 15 residues because they are more likely to accommodate, without destabilization of the helical duplex, a single nucleotide mismatch at a central position [26]. The second observation was that oligonucleotides linked through a (dT)15 track hybridized more efficiently than those without the track in agreement with previous results [27]. Third, the experiments indicated that the amount of oligonucleotide attached at concentrations between 5 and 50 μM was not limiting for detection of fluorescent DNAs. We chose the highest concentration tested for the standard protocol. Preliminary experiments showed also that hybridization solutions including 50% formamide resulted in poor sensitivity, and that the Unyhib solution (Arrayit) produced results comparable to those obtained with the hybridization solution described in Methods. To generate labeled targets, two different systems were used: direct labeling with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP, and indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 647; the latter proved easier, more reproducible, efficient and yielded targets showing higher stability.Specificity and sensitivity optimization of FMDV microarray ::: ResultsA step-wise increase of hybridization temperatures, between 48°C and 62°C, was tested. Low temperatures resulted in poor microarray performance due to high number of false positives. The optimal point mutation discrimination was obtained between 58°C and 60°C. Higher temperatures resulted in a progressive and significant loss of signal. Similar comparisons revealed 45°C as the most adequate temperature for washing the hybridized microarrays. A scheme of the entire procedure with indication of the steps for which variables were screened is depicted in Figure 3.Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsA total of 11 positions within genomic residues 3616 to 3654 were analyzed by constructing 15-mer oligonucleotides with the queried nucleotide (and a number of negative control mismatched nucleotides) located at position 7 to 11 in each 15-mer (Figure 2). Forty-one oligonucleotides were spotted in duplicate, distributed in 4 rows and 12 columns per grid (Figure 4). A conserved FMDV sequence was used as positive control for the hybridization (ICF). Two unrelated HIV oligonucleotides (HIVa and HIVb) and spots with no nucleotide (nn) were used as negative control. The same pattern containing spots with 15-mers corresponding to the different queried and control mutants, and positive (ICF) and negative (HIV, nn) controls were printed four times per slide.Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsRT-PCR products obtained with RNA from each of 16 mAb SD6-escape mutants of FMDV as template and primers 5'P-1R1L and pUL, were treated with lambda exonuclease, and labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 as detailed in Methods. The labeled DNA was hybridized in the microarray, as described in Methods.Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsFive oligonucleotides were designed to identify the wild-type C-S8c1 sequence at the following positions: 139 (S139), 142 and 143 (RGD), 144 (L144), 146 (H146) and 147 (L147). In the RGD panel good signal intensity was obtained at four of the positions tested (Figure 4); only the hybridization with S139 oligonucleotide produced a low signal.Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsFour mutants at position 139 were tested. Each mutant could be identified due to a high signal in the perfect match probe. No crosshybridization with G139t, G139c or S139 was detected (Figure 4b).Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsTwo point mutants at VP1 position 142, RRD and RED, as well as a double mutant for the 142 and 143 positions (REG), were available for testing. Hybridizations with each mutant generated positive signals with the wild-type oligonucleotides that did not include positions 142 and 143. However, hybridizations were positive with the probe that identified specifically each mutant, but not with the probe that represented the wild-type RGD sequence (Figure 4b).Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsPosition 143 is represented by four SD6-escape mutants: RGG, RGN, RGV and RGE. Each of them, as well as substitutions at position 144 (Figure 4b), produced the expected signal. Substitutions at position 144 were perfectly discriminated with the oligonucleotides designed in the microarray (Figure 4) with a slightly weak signal with the S139 probe. The three mutants analyzed at positions 146 and 147, named H146R, H146P and L147P, showed an adequate signal for specific identification, and no crosshybridization with other probes at the same position.Screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 ::: ResultsThe results (Figure 4b) indicate a good discrimination between positive and negative signals as well as strong signals in the ICF probe and no signal in any of the negative controls (HIVa HIVb and nn probes), as expected from the perfect match and mismatch hybridization signals, respectively. However, the hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific negative and positive signals as well as crosshybridization signals, which are of different intensity depending on the hybridization kinetics of each probe and target. Therefore, an array classification method was developed to evaluate the hybridization signals.Microarray quantification and quality control of hybridization signals ::: ResultsProcedures for microarray quantification, quality control of hybridization intensities, and data classification were applied to the microarray signals, as described in Methods. Jack-knife tests yielded a class averaged classification accuracy of 98.7 ± 2.4%. Table 1 shows classification accuracy per variant. Most variants are predicted above 95% accuracy. Exceptions include phenotypes RGE1 and RGV, with about 93% prediction accuracy. In order to study the distribution of errors, a confusion matrix is shown in Table 2. The matrix reveals that the small fraction of errors observed shows a systematic distribution. Thus, misclassified RGE samples are systematically classified as S139T samples, while a misclassified RGV sample is classified within the RGD variant, and a misclassified V144 sample is assigned to the RED mutant. Most likely, the observed errors have their origin in hybridization artefacts, and will probably be corrected in future versions of the chip. Nevertheless the achieved accuracy is already satisfactory in all cases for practical applications.Microarray quantification and quality control of hybridization signals ::: ResultsThe raw data corresponding to this paper are provided as additional files ' [see Additional file1]' and can be found also in [28].DiscussionA microarray-based method to type representatives of the seven serotypes of FMDV has been developed by Baxi and colleagues [17]. The microarray contained 155 oligonucleotide probes, of 35 to 45 residues from the VP3-VP1-2A-coding region of the FMDV genome. We have now used a specific approach based on a microarray platform aimed at distinguishing point mutants within an important determinant of antigenicity and host cell tropism, namely the G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 (Figures 1 and 2). Several preliminary experiments showed a notorious decrease in the quality of results using aldehyde coated slides, streptavidine coated magnetic beads to obtain single-stranded DNA or a formamide hybridization solution. Additionally, other conditions involving nucleotide probes of different length, presence or absence of spacers between the array substrate and the probe, and different labeling and hybridization conditions were tested. The best signal to noise ratios and the most reproducible results were achieved using 15-mer with oligo (dT)15 spacer and 50 μM concentrated oligonucleotide probes, with the queried position located towards the center of the probe, printed of super-epoxi-coated slides (experimental conditions detailed in Methods). Hybridization and washing temperatures were also selected after systematic preliminary experiments.DiscussionTo assess the reproducibility of the results, the classification accuracy was evaluated statistically using jack-knife simulations. This procedure revealed a high and stable degree of classification accuracy, although 2 variants were misclassified in more than 5% of cases. This was probably due to heterogeneity in the intensity of the hybridization reactions (Table 1 and 2). Despite this limitation in the reliable identification of some variants, the results illustrate the feasibility of a microarray approach to diagnose specific virus variants that may be associated with altered biological behaviors. Thus, the queried mutation was accurately discriminated from other mutations at the same site (Figure 4). In particular, the conserved L147 in VP1 is thought to be essential for integrin recognition of FMDV [29], and several substitutions at position 147 affect the interaction of FMDV of serotype C with antibodies. A variant with substitution L147P was isolated from a lesion of partially immunized cattle and had a profound effect on the antigenicity and tropism of FMDV [23]. This important L147P variant was correctly detected by the microarray. Crosshybridizations were observed with the probes to identify mutations that affect VP1 positions 142 and 143 (Figure 4b), expected from the high degree of overlap among these probes. This crosshybridization can be defined as the signal obtained when at least 9 nucleotides of a probe are perfect match with the target. For instance, mutant RGN shows a weak signal with the RGG probe, and the RGE mutant with the L144 probe. The two amino acids replaced in those variants are also essential for integrin recognition of FMDV [29].DiscussionDespite the bulk of microarray technology being used to define patterns of gene expression, increasing applications are found in the detection of genetic polymorphisms [30-32]. The application to discriminate among variants of FMDV is added to a number of microarray procedures used in virology to analyze multiple viral pathogens that belong to different virus families [18,33], to detect specific viruses [34-36] or to define genetic variations underwent by viruses [37,38] [reviews in [39,40]]. Microarray technology has been also used to probe differences in the structure of hepatitis C virus RNA, that result from genetic differences that may be associated with different responses to interferon treatment [41].DiscussionThe distinction among mutants of the same virus is becoming increasingly necessary in view of the extensive variation among representatives of most virus groups [42], the quasispecies population structure of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses [8], and the increasing recognition that one or a limited number of mutations in a viral genome can have a profound effect in its biological behavior [reviews in [8,10,24]]. In this report, we have documented that DNA microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the FMDV genome, and have successfully devised a SVM-based method to classify the samples on the basis of their hybridization signal. The procedure is of general applicability as a test for specificity and discriminatory power of microarray-based diagnostic procedures using multiple probes. We are currently investigating an extension of the same methodology to detect minority genomes in viral populations, as a means to quantify mutant spectrum complexity, and to evaluate memory levels in viral quasispecies [8,10,24].ConclusionIn the current study, we have documented that DNA microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the FMDV genome encoding relevant functions in antigenicity and receptor recognition. We have successfully devised a support vector machine (SVM)-based method to classify the samples on the basis of their hybridization signal. The bioinformatic procedure is of general applicability to fine genotyping, including studies of heterogeneous viral populations, genetic changes in virus, bacteria, and genes of rapidly evolving cells, such as tumoral cells.Cell culture and origin of FMDV mutants ::: MethodsProcedures for cell culture, infections with FMDV in liquid medium or in semisolid agar medium for titration of infectivity have been previously described [43]. FMDV biological clone C-S8c1, derived from natural isolate C-Sta Pau Sp/70 [43] was serially passaged 100 times in BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 2–4 plaque-forming-units (PFU) per cell; this yielded population C-S8c1p100. Individual FMDV mutants with nucleotide substitutions at the genomic region encoding the G-H loop of VP1 were isolated by selecting escape mutants resistant to monoclonal antibody (mAb) SD6, which recognizes amino acids 138 to 147 of VP1 [44] (Figure 1). The populations used to select mAb SD6-resistant mutants were derived from C-S8c1p100, in experiments designed to test duration of quasispecies memory [45]. Procedures to select mAb SD6-resistant mutants were described previously [44,46,47].Microarray design and printing ::: MethodsThirty eight DNA oligonucleotides, corresponding to the C-S8c1 genomic region encoding residues 139 to 147 (Figure 1) were designed and synthesized (Sigma). They included a 'C6 amino linker' [NH2 (CH2)6] at their 5'-end, followed by an oligo (dT)15 spacer and the specific 15-mer sequence; the oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC. The oligonucleotides (Figure 2) were selected to have a similar melting temperature when annealed to a complementary sequence, and included the queried nucleotide at the central region of the specific 15-mer. A conserved FMDV sequence, located between genomic residues 3757 and 3775 (5'-C6-T15CCTAGGCCGATTCTTCCG-3', within the VP1-coding region) [the numbering of FMDV genomic residues is according to [48]] was used as positive control for the hybridization (ICF, Internal Control FMDV). Two unrelated oligonucleotides (5'-C6-T15CAATACATGGATGATT-3' and 5'-C6-T15GATGCATATTTTTCAG-3', corresponding to the HIV reverse transcriptase coding region and termed HIVa and HIVb respectively) and spots with spotting solution with no nucleotide (nn in Figure 4) were used as negative controls. The oligonucleotides were diluted in 1 × spotting solution (Telechem-Arrayit) at 50 μM final concentration, and spotted onto super-epoxy-coated glass slides (Telechem-Arrayit).Microarray design and printing ::: MethodsMicroarrays containing 384 spots were printed by means of a GMS 417 DNA arrayer (Affymetrix) defining four grids per slide. Each oligonucleotide was spotted in duplicate dots 150 μm in diameter, with a center-to-center distance of 250 μm (Figure 3).Microarray design and printing ::: MethodsIn a number of preliminary assays, 11-mer and 15-mer oligonucleotides at concentrations of 5, 25 and 50 μM, and with or without an oligo (dT)15 spacer at the 5'-end were compared; the final protocol corresponds to the set of materials and conditions showing the highest sensitivity and reproducibility, among the conditions tested.Preparation of target DNAs ::: MethodsRNA from mAb SD6-escape mutants [45] was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogene), as previously described [48]. RNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (RT) and pUL as primer (5'-GAGAAGAAGAAGGCCCAGGGTG-3'; antisense primer, complementary to positions 3873 to 3896 of the FMDV C-S8c1 genome). PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed using Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche), as specified by the manufacturers; the primers used were 1R1L (5'-ACACCGTGTGTTGGCTACGGCG-3'; sense primer, corresponding to FMDV C-S8c1 genomic residues 3573 to 3594; phosphorylated at its 5'-end) and pUL. Each of the RT-PCR products was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Abi Prism, Perkin Elmer) and the automated sequencers ABI 373 or ABI 3700, to ensure the presence of the mAb-escape mutation. The phosphorylated strand was specifically degraded using lambda exonuclease (New England Biolabs), and the resulting single-stranded DNA was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 using the U-21660 Ulysis Nucleic Acid Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes). The labeled DNA was used as target in the hybridization with the probe oligonucleotides on the microarrays.Preparation of target DNAs ::: MethodsIn a number of preliminary assays, a streptavidin-biotin system was assessed to obtain single-strand DNA target (AffiniTip Strep, -Hydros). Additionally, Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence dyes (Amersham) were used as a direct labeling system. The final protocol includes the reagents showing in our hands the highest sensitivity and reproducibility.Hybridization and scanning ::: MethodsImmediately before hybridization, slides were processed as follows: They were washed for 2 min. at room temperature with 2X sodium saline citrate (SSC), 0.1% lauroylsarcosine, and for an additional 2 min. wash with 2 × SSC at room temperature, to remove unbound DNA and components of the printing buffer. The oligonucleotides were denatured by placing the slides 2 min. in distilled water at 100°C, cooled 10 sec. at room temperature, and then the oligonucleotides were fixed by plunging the slides into ice-cold 100% ethanol for 2 min., finally the slides were centrifuged 1 min. at 500 × g (Minicentrifuge Arrayit). Microarrays were incubated in a hybridization chamber (Genetix) with 20 μl of hybridization buffer (6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1% BSA) under a 24 × 24 mm cover slip, and bathed at 42°C for 45 min. Then the microarrays were washed with distilled water, and dried by a brief centrifugation.Hybridization and scanning ::: MethodsThe hybridization with the labeled DNA was carried out in hybridization buffer at the appropriate temperature (58–60°C) and with the required amount of target (0.3 pmoles Alexa Fluor 647 equivalent to 50 ng). After a 3 hours incubation in the hybridization chamber, the slides were washed for 5 min. in 2 × SSC, 0.1% lauroylsarcosine, followed by 5 min. in 2 × SSC, and finally rinsed 10 sec. in 0.2 × SSC, and 5 min. in distilled water, at 45°C. The slides were dried by spinning 1 min. at 500 × g and, finally, scanned using a G2565AA/G2565AB Scanner (Agilent). The Agilent and Scan Array Express (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) analysis software was used for reading and quantifying the hybridization images. The reproducibility of the method was assessed by comparing the results of at least five different hybridization experiments for each mutant.Data pre-processing ::: MethodsArray quantification was performed with the program Scan Array Express. Each probe was duplicated in the array. For each spot in the array, measures for the mean and median foreground intensity and for the mean and median background intensities were available. Visual inspection of scanned hybridized arrays revealed some noise due to the presence of dust and scratches, introducing an uneven increase in the mean foreground signal for some spots. We have tried to detect the affected spots by calculating a Z-score of their mean foreground intensity per pixel, using the four measurements available for each probe in every hybridization experiment. For this, we have used the additional measures available for the same probe (median foreground intensity and replicated spot mean and median foreground intensity) and computed their average and standard deviation. Then we calculated the Z-score in the usual way, subtracting the average from the mean foreground intensity and then dividing it by the standard deviation. After testing several absolute Z-score thresholds for discarding spots, we have found that a Z-score of 7 provides optimal results. If neither of the spots is discarded, we take as a measure for the presence of each mutant in the sample (Ma), the log2 of the average of its replicated spots mean foreground intensities, subtracted from its background:Data pre-processing ::: MethodsMa=log⁡2(Ia1−Ba1+Ia2−Ba22) MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatCvAUfKttLearuWrP9MDH5MBPbIqV92AaeXatLxBI9gBaebbnrfifHhDYfgasaacH8akY=wiFfYdH8Gipec8Eeeu0xXdbba9frFj0=OqFfea0dXdd9vqai=hGuQ8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qiLsFr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacaGaaeqabaqabeGadaaakeaacqWGnbqtdaWgaaWcbaGaemyyaegabeaakiabg2da9iGbcYgaSjabc+gaVjabcEgaNnaaBaaaleaacqaIYaGmaeqaaOGaeiikaGYaaSaaaeaacqWGjbqsdaWgaaWcbaGaemyyaeMaeGymaedabeaakiabgkHiTiabdkeacnaaBaaaleaacqWGHbqycqaIXaqmaeqaaOGaey4kaSIaemysaK0aaSbaaSqaaiabdggaHjabikdaYaqabaGccqGHsislcqWGcbGqdaWgaaWcbaGaemyyaeMaeGOmaidabeaaaOqaaiabikdaYaaacqGGPaqkaaa@4924@Data pre-processing ::: Methodswhere Ia1 and Ia2 are the mean foreground pixel intensities and Ba1 and Ba2 are the mean background pixel intensities for spot 1 and spot 2 of the probe for variant a, respectively. In case one of the spots is discarded, we take Ma as the log2 of the remaining spot mean foreground intensity subtracted from its mean background intensity.Data pre-processing ::: MethodsAs a hybridization quality control, we added a probe for a fully conserved region of VP1 of the FMDV (ICF), discarding those arrays for which the log2 of the average intensity for this probe was under 7, in our experience a threshold that distinguishes arrays with hybridization problems from the normal ones. We tried several normalization conditions as taking the square root of the average spots mean intensities instead of the log2 or making a prior normalization by dividing each Ma by MICF, but final classification accuracy was optimal at the conditions reported.Data classification ::: MethodsData classification was carried out with a multiple class support vector machine tool (mcSVM) [49,50]. Briefly, a SVM is a supervised learning algorithm [51]. It belongs to the class of methods that solve the general problem of learning discriminative boundaries, able to optimally separate positive and negative members of a given set of points in a n-dimensional vector space. The SVM algorithm operates by first mapping the training set into a high-dimensional feature space and then attempting to locate in that space a hyperplane that separates positive from negative examples. Having found such a hyperplane, the SVM can then predict the classification of an unlabeled example by mapping it into the feature space and asking on which side of the separating plane the example is found. The multiclass SVM is an extension of the classification problem to multiple classes, instead of just a binary classification.Data classification ::: MethodsIn our case, we have used 39 probes in the array for classification purposes, one for quality control ICF and 38 for detecting different genotypes, including mutants and wild type. Therefore, each sample was encoded by a 39 dimensional vector, each dimension corresponding to a variable computed in equation 1. We analyzed 202 samples distributed among 17 phenotype classes to classify (Table 1). We ensured that at least 6 samples were available for each variant (Table 1). We applied mcSVM to this problem, using a Gaussian kernel which yielded γ = 10-2 and α = 103 as optimal parameters.Assessing the classifier ::: MethodsIn order to test the prediction capabilities of the method, we applied a jack-knife test. We assigned randomly the samples to 10 different groups. Each one of the groups, with 10% of the samples, was used as a test set, while the remaining 90% was used as a training set. We then measured the fraction of correctly predicted samples by mcSVM in the test. The procedure was repeated for all groups, completing in this way one round of testing. 100 rounds were simulated, each time with a different random distribution of samples in the groups. We averaged out the fraction of correctly predicted samples to obtain the final quality of the classifier. We also built a confusion table in order to study the presence of systematic errors in the cases that failed (Table 2). This table shows in a row-wise mode the fraction of samples of each phenotype variant classified in any other variants.Authors' contributionsVM and CP performed most of the experiments, have been involved in conception and design of the study, in target preparation, acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data, and helped to prepare the manuscript.Authors' contributionsDA and ARO performed the bioinformatics analysis and contributed to interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript.Authors' contributionsED conceived and designed the study, had FMDV mutants to prepare the targets, drafted the manuscript, and revised it critically for important intellectual content.Authors' contributionsCB conceived the study, set up DNA microarrays technology for this approach and printed the arrays, in the design and coordination of experiments and helped to prepare the manuscript.Authors' contributionsAll authors read and approved the final manuscript."
Markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease characterized by an airflow limitation and inflammation of the lower airways [1]. As the disease worsens, some patients experience 'exacerbations' of their principal symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum. These exacerbations frequently result in a visit to a general practitioner's office or to a local hospital for treatment. Exacerbations occur in COPD patients at a median of three times a year with half of them being unreported [2-4]. The heterogeneity of COPD exacerbations make them difficult to define, classify and manage due to their range of symptoms, varied treatment requirements, seasonal occurrence, and ambiguous aetiology [5-14].BackgroundTo address this problem, attempts have been made to develop a consensus definition for COPD exacerbations [15]. Recently, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) adopted the following definition: 'an event in the natural course of the disease that is characterised by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough and sputum beyond day-to-day variability sufficient to warrant a change in management' [1].BackgroundThe severity of an exacerbation has been also difficult to classify despite the various schemes that have been proposed to deal with this issue [4,15-17]. The ATS and ERS have also jointly suggested a classification based upon severity and the type of medical management used, i.e., Exacerbation Level I is home treatment, Level II is hospitalization, and Level III is specialised care [1]. The aim of this scheme is to improve the existing management of exacerbations and to serve as an aid in the assessment of treatment efficacy.BackgroundDifferent operational definitions for COPD exacerbations have been proposed in the past and these have helped determine their relative importance, in particular their relationship to COPD progression [1-17]. However, these definitions have relied primarily on symptoms, and this along with the absence of a standard classification for the degree of symptom severity, has delayed the development of new therapies for this condition. The current therapies for exacerbations have been evaluated based on their ability to reduce symptoms, and to improve a patient's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) since the latter is strongly correlated with COPD mortality. However, FEV1 does not discriminate well between the stable and exacerbative states of COPD, particularly during the later stages of this disease. Hence, the development of biological markers, or biomarkers that are more sensitive and specific to the severity of COPD exacerbations would provide investigators with new insights and directions for further research.BackgroundAt this time, only a few clinical variables or inflammatory mediators have been shown to be associated with COPD exacerbations and their related morbidity and mortality. Some of those include: age [18-20]; FEV1, forced vital capacity and peak expired flow [19,21,22]; body mass index [20]; albumin [20,22,23]; sodium [23]; pH [24,25]; eosinophils [26-29]; interleukins 6 and 8 [29-32]; fibrinogen [31]; and C-reactive protein [33]. Significant clinical events such as the number of exacerbations per year, the number of hospital admissions per year, time to relapses, and days in hospital have been regarded as useful measures in clinical studies designed to assess drug efficacy and cost-effectiveness as well as to standardize existing hospital support programs for COPD [34-39]. However, it is not known how these measures change with increasing severity of COPD exacerbations.BackgroundTherefore, we have surveyed the medical literature to identify which of the commonly accepted variables and suggested markers for COPD exacerbations change according to the ATS/ERS' levels of exacerbation severity. The long-term aim of our work is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of potential markers for use in future COPD studies as well as to determine how such markers can be further studied and fully integrated into the development of new drugs for COPD.Search strategy, study selection and overall objectives ::: MethodsWe searched standard databases since 1966 using medical search headings and related terms as obtained from major consensus documents related to COPD exacerbations. The major keywords were 'exacerbation', 'unstable', 'acute', 'bronchitis', and variants of the term 'COPD'. This phase of our search retrieved a total of 843 citations. For these citations, we read the title and abstract of each citation so as to exclude citations that concerned exacerbations of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, cystic fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary emboli, and community pneumonia. Citations for case studies, letters, reviews, meta-analyses, and animal studies were also excluded.Search strategy, study selection and overall objectives ::: MethodsAfter this initial screening, we identified 387 citations to papers that were of possible interest. We retrieved the original articles in electronic and hard copy forms, and then critically read each article. As a result of this step, we arrived at a total of 268 studies in our final review and analyses. We selected these studies based on the availability of demographics, spirometry, clear study eligibility criteria, and the potential markers being used to assess exacerbations.Search strategy, study selection and overall objectives ::: MethodsThe objectives of this literature review and data analyses were to determine which of the baseline measures commonly used in COPD exacerbation studies change with the extent of the exacerbation and disease severity, and to determine whether COPD exacerbations can be modelled as 'events' or 'time-to-event' in future investigations.Data abstraction methods ::: MethodsInitially, we considered various exacerbation definitions and classification schemes, in particular, those suggested by Rodriguez-Roisin [15] as well as those described by Pauwels and colleagues [17]. However, we determined that the ATS/ERS' operational classification of exacerbation severity [1] was the most sensible and feasible system for systematically assessing the patient baseline characteristics and biomarker information from the majority of published studies. We therefore used this classification scheme and the related clinical history, physical findings and diagnostic procedures for managing exacerbations to perform our data abstraction. From each study, we retrieved the reported demographics, spirometry, smoking status, clinical, cytological and biochemical variables as well as suggested markers of the severity of the exacerbation at baseline conditions, i.e., immediately prior to, or during the exacerbation event but before the time in which the intervention of interest was investigated (Table 1). Whenever such variables were measured in stable conditions, we also abstracted this information. For each study, we noted the type of definition used to define an exacerbation such as symptom- or event-based as well as the research question asked, the experimental design used, any sponsorship, and the presence or absence of data from individual study patients. Data was then further organized according to sample size and smoking status when available. Cytological and biochemical data were also classified according to their collection methods. These included sputum induction, bronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), exhaled breath sampling, and blood sampling.Data abstraction methods ::: MethodsWe were also aware of the possibility that for some study groups in severity Levels II and III (as per the ATS/ERS criteria) included in this review may have experienced a similar quality of care or medical management that was not reported adequately in the original publication. In attempt to correct for this problem, we combined the exacerbation data from Levels II and III into an 'in-patient' category and then compared it to Level I that we regarded as the 'out-patient' category.Statistical methods ::: MethodsWe collected and calculated study means, medians, standard errors, standard deviations, 95% confidence interval, and inter-quartile ranges using the statistical algorithms in Microsoft Excel 2002. We then conducted fixed effect meta-analyses to obtain mean point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and two standard deviations for each exacerbation level [40]. Exacerbation Severity Levels I and II, II and III, and I and III were each compared using a two-tailed Z-test. The alpha level of p < 0.05 was adjusted for multiple testing according to the Bonferroni correction procedure [41]. In the event that a specific exacerbation severity level had a large number of studies in which only median data were available, the data were considered to be normally distributed and medians were treated as means. Since many studies did not publish data for individual patients, we were limited in addressing non-normality in the data by using a log10-transformation.Statistical methods ::: MethodsWe again performed a fixed effect meta-analysis to obtain mean point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and two standard deviations for in-patient and out-patient categories of each measure. We then compared each category using a two-tailed Z-test and a p-value of 0.05.Description of studies and study subjects ::: ResultsOur search strategy yielded 268 suitable studies that met our selection criteria. These studies were published between 1979 and July 2004 – Week 2. (The references for these studies can be found at the LACDR Division of Pharmacology website [42]). The total number of study subjects included in this review was 142,407. Of this group, 18% fell in Exacerbation Severity Level I, 78% in Level II, and 4% in Level III. When we re-analysed the data according to out- or in-patient settings, 18% were out-patients and 82% in-patients.Description of studies and study subjects ::: ResultsMeta-analyses of typical study demographics showed that there was significant overlap in 95% confidence intervals and study data distributions for the three exacerbation severity levels except for age where study patients in Level II had a mean age of 64.2 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.9 to 65.5 years) compared to 68.0 years (95% CI: 65.9 to 70.1 years) for patients in Level III (p = 0.002) (Table 2). When the demographics were re-analyzed according to patient settings, we determined that only body mass index was statistically different between the out-patient setting (mean point estimate: 26.2 kg/m2; 95% CI: 23.8 to 28.7 kg/m2) and the in-patient setting (mean point estimate: 23.4 kg/m2; 95% CI: 22.5 to 24.3 kg/m2) (p = 0.038) (Table 3).Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsThe spirometry measures Forced Expired Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), both in percent predicted, decreased from Exacerbation Levels I to II (p < 0.017) but remained unchanged from Levels II to III (Figure 1A and 1C, respectively). However, when Levels II and III were combined to create an 'in-patient' category for each of these variables, there was a statistically significant decrease for the in-patients versus the out-patients (p < 0.05) (Figure 1B and 1D, respectively). We also observed the same trend for FEV1/FVC (Figure 2A and 2B). For all other spirometry measures, there were too few studies available in Level III for meta-analysis.Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsWe found for smoking that pack years increased with exacerbation severity, but only Levels I and II were statistically different (p = 0.015) (Figure 2C). When we compared pack years between patient settings, it was statistically higher for the in-patients than the out-patients (p = 0.010) (Figure 2D).Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsIn terms of the hemodynamic measures, only heart rate showed a statistically significant difference being higher in Level II than Level I (p = 0.014) with no difference between Levels II and III (Figure 3A). Heart rates were also higher for in-patients than out-patients (p = 0.011) (Figure 3B).Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsThe clinical measures of dyspnoea, i.e., the breathing rate (Figure 3C) and Borg dyspnoea score, tended to increase from Levels I to II and then decrease from Levels II to III. However, only breathing rate demonstrated clear statistical differences between the three levels (p < 0.017). Only Levels II and III of the Borg Dyspnoea Score were statistically different (p < 0.001); a statistical comparison of these levels with Level I was not possible due to lack of data. When patient settings were compared, only breathing rate showed a clear statistical difference being statistically lower for in-patients than out-patients (p = 0.003) (Figure 3D).Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsExacerbation Levels II and III were statistically different with respect to pH (p = 0.003) and bicarbonate (p = 0.002) in that pH decreased from Level II to III whereas bicarbonate increased. However, there was insufficient Level I data for each variable to allow for statistical comparisons with the other Levels. There was also insufficient data available to compare out-patients with in-patients.Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsIn terms of blood gas measures studied, only arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) showed a statistically significant increase with increasing exacerbation severity (p < 0.017) (Figure 4A) as well as out- versus in-patients (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). In the case of oxygen saturation, it gradually decreased with increasing exacerbation severity with statistically significant differences between Levels I and II (p < 0.001) as well as Levels I and III (p = 0.011) (Figure 4C). It also decreased going from an out-patient to an in-patient setting (P < 0.001) (Figure 4D).Relationship of different variables and biomarkers with exacerbation severity and patient setting ::: ResultsThe six minute walking distance challenge test seemed to show a decreasing trend with increasing exacerbation severity but such changes did not reach statistical significance. This was also the case when the out- and in-patients were compared. Many other variables related to spirometry, respiratory status, exacerbation and hospital event categories also did not change significantly with exacerbation severity or out- and in-patients (See additional file: 1). There was not enough data in the bacteriology and virology categories to permit any meta-analyses. Of the 268 studies sampled, only half contained data about the biochemical variables.DiscussionWe conducted this review of the COPD exacerbation literature to determine which commonly-accepted baseline variables and suggested markers changed in a consistent manner with the severity of COPD exacerbations. As our index of COPD severity, we used the recently published ATS/ERS operational classification of exacerbation severity for medical management. This is because most of the published literature rarely provides sufficient details to characterise the severity of a patient's exacerbation. In addition, we also analyzed the same data according to out- and in-patient settings so as to account for possible overlaps in medical management between Levels II and III but were not reported in the original publication.DiscussionThe long-term aim of our work is to improve the quality and applicability of exacerbation management through the identification of sensitive and specific markers that can be used for the assessment of treatment effects. This review identified a few potential markers of exacerbation severity.DiscussionWhen we assessed the spirometry measures FEV1 and FVC in % predicted, as well as FEV1/FVC, we observed statistically significant differences with exacerbation severity, and between out- and in-patients (Figures 1A–D and 2A–B). One draw-back was the paucity of such information in Level III studies. This confirms the clinical situation that as exacerbations worsen and more specialised care is required, spirometry measurements are less likely under baseline conditions or during an exacerbation [14]. Thus, such data is rare in many published studies.DiscussionThe number of smoking-related pack years increased with exacerbation severity and showed a clear difference between out- and in-patient settings (Figures 2C and 2D), a finding that is consistent with the idea that the more a COPD patient smokes, and for longer, the higher the likelihood that COPD exacerbations will be more severe. According to the mean point estimates obtained in this study, COPD patients with 40 to 60 pack-years of smoking will experience an increase in the severity of COPD exacerbations. However, our conclusion regarding this finding is limited by there being data from only two studies at Level III.DiscussionAlthough heart rate varied little between Exacerbation Levels II to III, it is important to note that it was substantially elevated in patients (Figure 3A) with the clearest difference being between in- and out-patients. This is possibly associated with the anxiety and dyspnea that experienced when an exacerbation occurs. The increase in heart rate of course increases the oxygen requirements of the heart. The increased heart rate may also be the result of underlying cardiovascular disease that is more prominent in severe COPD patients [43].DiscussionThe relationship of pH and bicarbonate to exacerbation severity are consistent with the signs of respiratory acidosis evident in COPD patients with exacerbations [1,24,25]. However, due to the shortage of data in Level I, proper statistical conclusions about each of these variables are difficult to make. In relation to this, breathing rate significantly increased from Levels I to II and then decreased from Levels II to III (Figure 3C). The first observation may reflect components of the exacerbation episode (i.e., anxiety and dyspnea) as well as the physiological need to breathe more to maintain adequate blood gas levels. The reduction at Level III possibly reflects the results of the specialized care where patients are given ventilatory support so as to return the breathing rate to normal. The Borg Dyspnea Score showed the same trend as breathing rate, although insufficient data in Level I did not allow for further comparisons. When out- and in-patient data were compared for each of these variables, only breathing rate demonstrated a clear statistical difference (Figure 3D). The Borg Dyspnoea Score on the other hand did not have enough studies in the out-patient category to perform any statistical test. Overall, the observed trends were consistent with the fact that management of dyspnoea is one of the main factors generating the high hospital costs associated with COPD exacerbations [44]. In keeping with the direct measures of dyspnoea, arterial carbon dioxide tension showed a clear relationship with exacerbation severity and patient management settings (Figures 4A and 4B) that is consistent with the conclusions reported in the medical literature [20,45-47]. Arterial oxygen tension in contrast did not change with exacerbation severity or patient setting. Possibly this lack of correlation reflects the immediate administration of supplemental oxygen given to hypoxaemic patients in a hospital setting. There was however a decreasing trend in oxygen saturation with increasing exacerbation severity and clear differences between out- and in-patient settings (Figures 4C and 4D) that are consistent with the present thinking on blood gas changes.DiscussionMost of the other commonly accepted measures and suggested biomarkers poorly reflected exacerbation severity, or the fact that there was not sufficient data to undertake a meta-analysis (See additional file: 1). This finding recalls a 2001 US Department of Health and Human Services report on exacerbation treatment outcomes from over 200 randomised controlled trials [14]. The aim of that study was to create new guidelines to improve the management of COPD exacerbations. That study also concluded that the current literature was limited in terms of the number of studies and the amount of detail available as well as the reliability and accuracy of the clinical assessments used to discriminate between COPD exacerbations and other causes of worsening respiratory status. Thus, our observations agree with previous observations regarding the assessment of the unstable COPD literature.DiscussionAs previously discussed, most of the studies used for this review were predominately with hospitalized patients (Level II). However, most COPD occurs in an out-patient setting (Level I) [48-53]. This has implications for our study since the latter population was poorly represented.DiscussionOur basic categorisation was according to the ATS/ERS' operational scheme for classifying the severity of COPD exacerbations as well as to out- and in-patient categories. To our knowledge, we are the first to undertake this type of literature review and thus we were faced with a lack of consistency in the definition of exacerbations as used in the various studies. We tried to overcome this difficulty by selecting and ranking clinical studies so as to improve the comparability of subjects between studies.DiscussionWe were also aware that the clinical studies we analysed differed with respect to which comorbidities or identifiable causes for exacerbations were reported. Most patients were elderly and therefore were more likely to be suffering from one or more co-existing diseases such as asthma or cardiovascular disease. Such co-morbidity makes interpretation of our findings more difficult with respect to the true causes of exacerbations. If their aetiology could be determined, then susceptible patients such as those in Level I could be identified and new treatments developed to help prevent their onset and related hospital costs.DiscussionFinally, the compatibility between the studies of COPD exacerbation that we analysed may have been limited by substantial variations in the time and location of studies. Exacerbations are more likely in summer [5] but many studies failed to report the time of year or the time period for study implementation. Thus, seasonal effects, combined with the low incidence of exacerbations per patient, could represent an inherent bias. In addition, different institutions probably had different standards with respect to diagnosis and management of COPD exacerbations when these studies were performed. Such variations may also explain any observed inconsistencies in our findings. However, we attempted to overcome this possible bias in Exacerbation Levels II and III by the subsequent re-analysis of this data on the basis of out-patient and in-patient settings.DiscussionAs observed in The additional online file, there was a scarcity of information particularly for biomarkers at different exacerbation levels. It is also unclear to us whether any of the variables that changed with exacerbation severity are causally-related. Hence, longitudinal studies and/or less restrictive eligibility criteria would be needed to address all these questions. One difficulty in tackling such problems is the enormous amount of time and expense involved in implementing such studies. In addition, the current methods for data analysis in clinical studies have limitations imposed by the assessment of the reduction in frequency or total suppression of exacerbation episodes (i.e. rare event or ""non-event"").DiscussionTo overcome these drawbacks and obtain more accurate evaluation of treatment effect on COPD exacerbations, alternative analytical methods based, for example, on predictive mathematical models such as hidden Markov chains or Bayesian forecasting should be tried. Such models can characterise and predict rare events without undertaking a full-scale, long-term longitudinal study. This approach to predicting rare events has been used previously in studies of migraine, epilepsy and various cardiovascular diseases where the size of treatment effect is measured in terms of a reduction in the frequency of the repetition of an event within a given probability or within a given time period [54,55]. One example of a mathematical model development includes the use of a Markov model to predict COPD exacerbation rates in a clinical trial of the inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium [56]. In this example, the model was developed on the basis of prior knowledge of the exacerbation rate as estimated from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trial data. This gave the probabilities for COPD exacerbations for different stages of COPD. In another study, a proportional hazards model was used to identify risk factors for COPD patients hospitalised due to an exacerbation [44]. The current ATS/ERS guidelines for exacerbations do not consider the implications of using probabilistic models as a means of assessing the severity of COPD exacerbations or the effect of treatment [1]. A modelling approach may offer new insights into which variables related to COPD exacerbations should be investigated.DiscussionFrom a research planning perspective, our study findings have generated some hypotheses and related considerations that could be evaluated in future clinical trials. One hypothesis is that the combination of variables that we observed to change in our study (i.e., FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, arterial carbon dioxide, breathing rate, heart rate, pack years, and oxygen saturation) could represent a new definition for a 'severe' exacerbation event. Most definitions in the literature, including the recent ATS/ERS definition, do not indicate any assessment of (patho)physiological variables as signs of an exacerbation. They simply regard the exacerbation as a worsening of the normal day-to-day symptoms and/or an adjustment in medical management [17]. A definition that encompasses a clear set of objective measures would be useful to medical practitioners who predominantly rely on clinical judgement or past experiences for diagnosing an exacerbation and its severity as well as for assessing treatment effect.DiscussionAnother important consideration for future clinical trials is the assessment of treatment effect based on predictions of exacerbation frequency and intensity. In other words, the collection of data such as the rate of onset and resolution of an exacerbation from longitudinal studies could be used to determine probabilities of second, third, fourth, etc., exacerbation events in individual patients [54]. The alteration of such probabilities with an experimental treatment could be a more sensitive and reliable approach for assessing treatment effect in clinical trials than recording daily changes in symptoms or medical management.DiscussionLastly, our findings were obtained from COPD patients that had experienced at least one exacerbation during the study assessment period. In the same studies, there were also patients who did not experience an exacerbation. This indicates that a fraction of COPD patients may be regarded as being susceptible to an exacerbation whereas another fraction is 'exacerbation-free'. It would be interesting to determine how the variables we identified in our study change in the latter patient group according to FEV1. Some published studies have stratified COPD patients on the basis of exacerbation frequency; this is generally done by categorising patients as having either 'infrequent' or 'frequent' exacerbations if they had less than or greater than a mean of three exacerbations per year, respectively [57]. In our study, we were unable to make this distinction between COPD patients since many of the published studies did not provide individual patient data on exacerbation frequency. We are currently investigating a commercial database of clinical trials that will enable us to look at patients with 'infrequent' or 'frequent' exacerbations. The results of this work could help us better select patients as well as identify potential markers for future longitudinal studies.ConclusionThe current management and treatment of COPD exacerbations is primarily dependent on the evaluation of the symptoms rather than the signs related to the exacerbation event. We found that arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate consistently varied with the severity of COPD exacerbations and with in- versus out-patients. Other commonly-accepted measures and suggested biomarkers for exacerbations failed to show consistent trends or lacked sufficient data to permit any meta-analysis. We recommend the design of longitudinal studies looking at the frequency of exacerbations as well as the use of more advanced modelling techniques to improve the selection of potential markers for the categorization of the severity of COPD exacerbations and the assessment of treatment effect in future studies.AbbreviationsATS – American Thoracic SocietyAbbreviationsERS – European Respiratory SocietyAbbreviationsCOPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseAbbreviationsFEV1 – Forced Expired Volume in One SecondAbbreviationsFVC – Forced Vital CapacityCompeting interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsLF and ODP contributed to the research concept.

Expression and processing of the Hepatitis E virus ORF1 nonstructural polyprotein,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the etiological agent for hepatitis E. It has been the cause of large epidemics as well as many sporadic cases of acute viral hepatitis in much of the developing world [1-5]. The viral genome is a single-stranded 7.2-kb polyadenylated RNA of positive sense containing three open reading frames (ORFs) [6,7]. Of these, ORF2 encodes an 88-kDa glycoprotein that is the major viral capsid protein [8,9]; ORF3 encodes a phosphoprotein [10], which is involved in cell signaling through MAP kinase pathway [11].BackgroundThe third ORF, called ORF1 is 5109 bp long and encodes the viral nonstructural polyprotein with a proposed molecular mass of ~186 kDa. Based on protein sequence homology, the ORF1 polyprotein is proposed to contain four putative domains indicative of methyltransferase (MeT), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), RNA Helicase (Hel), and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Fig. 1) [12]. Of these, the MeT and RdRp enzymatic activities have been demonstrated [13,14] while activities of the Hel and PCP have so far not been elucidated. Attempts have also been made to study ORF1 processing using different expression systems. In one study, the ~186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein was expressed through recombinant vaccinia virus infection of mammalian cells, but no processed products were initially observed [15]. Following extended incubation for 24–36 hours, two processed bands of ~107 and ~78 kDa were observed. Mutagenesis of the proposed cysteine protease domain of ORF1 suggested that the HEV protease had no role in ORF1 polyprotein processing. The cleavage of the ~186 kDa protein was attributed either to a vaccinia-virus encoded protease or a cellular protease.BackgroundIn another study, ORF1 processing was addressed through in vitro transcription and translation, and expression in either E. coli or human cells [16]. Prokaryotic expression resulted in a ~212 kDa glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein that exhibited strong reactivity with the antibodies raised against the putative domains of ORF1. Since no other smaller products were observed, ORF1 processing did not seem to occur in the prokaryotic system. When the expression of ORF1 was studied by carrying out in vitro coupled transcription and translation, a polyprotein of ~186 kDa could again be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the various putative domains of ORF1, but no smaller fragments were observed. The expression in transiently transfected HepG2 cells also resulted in a ~186 kDa protein, but no other smaller sized fragments were seen [16]. Transfection of an in vitro generated infectious full-length HEV RNA into HepG2 cells has also been used to assess ORF1 expression and processing [17]. This resulted in the formation of processed forms of the ORF1 polyprotein that could be immunoprecipitated with various domain-specific antibodies [17].BackgroundThough ORF1 processing was reported in at least one study in the context of genomic RNA, it is not clear why this was not observed in other studies. This could be due to improper folding of the GST-ORF1 fusion protein expressed in the prokaryotic system, and low yields of the protein expressed in coupled in vitro transcription-translation or mammalian expression systems. To address this, we expressed a recombinant ORF1 polyprotein tagged at its N- and C-termini in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system, and detected the processed fragments using antibodies specific for the N-terminal hexa-histidine and C-terminal FLAG epitopes. Using this strategy, we show here that the ORF1 polyprotein is processed in insect cells and that this involves both cysteine and non-cysteine proteases. The processing of ORF1 was also confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of one of the processed fragments and by western blotting with antibodies to the methyltransferase domain.Construction of the recombinant baculovirus ::: ResultsThe HEV-ORF1 was PCR amplified (data not shown) using the HEV full-length cDNA as a template, so that when expressed, the protein had an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 1). The amplified gene was cloned in TOPO-TA vector, in vitro transcribed and translated to generate a polyprotein of ~192 kDa (data not shown). After confirming proper expression of the amplified fragment, it was cloned in the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis-2b (Invitrogen). Co-transfection of the recombinant plasmid and pBlueBac DNA (Invitrogen), followed by selection and plaque purification, resulted in generation of the recombinant virus, called vORF1. For subsequent infection, this was amplified to a titer of 108 pfu/ml in Sf21 cells.ORF1 expression and processing ::: ResultsTo study the time course of recombinant ORF1 polyprotein expression, vORF1 was used to infect T. ni cells. The infected cells were harvested at various times post-infection and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using anti-His or anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2). Expression of the ORF1 polyprotein was seen as early as 24 hr post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 2A, lane1), the time at which the polyhedrin promoter is activated. At this time, besides the ~192 kDa fragment, other fragments with sizes of ~98 and 47 kDa were also observed with anti-His antibodies. Around 48 hpi, two additional bands of ~35 and 22 kDa were seen and all of these fragments were found to increase with time till 72 hpi (Fig. 2A). When expression was analyzed using anti-FLAG antibodies, besides the ~192 kDa polyprotein, smaller fragments of ~122, 106, 93, 59 and 26 kDa were also observed in a temporal manner (Fig. 2B). As a negative control, no staining was observed with either antibody in wild type AcMNPV (wt) infected T. ni cells (Fig. 2A and 2B, lane 6). The expression of the ~192 kDa fragments and accumulation of smaller fragments as a function of time was indicative of processing of the ORF1 polyprotein. The processing was further confirmed with antibodies against the MeT domain, the most N-terminal predicted domain in the polyprotein. The pattern of processing observed with anti-MeT antibodies (Fig. 2C) was identical to that obtained using anti-His antibodies (Fig. 2A).Effect of cysteine protease inhibition on ORF1 processing ::: ResultsThe ORF1 polyprotein contains a putative PCP domain. To further validate processing of the ORF1 polyprotein and to assess the role of cysteine protease in this, we used the cell permeable cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d. Following infection of insect cells with vORF1, the cells were treated with E-64d and the cell lysates analyzed by western blotting with anti-His or anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3A and 3B). At 48 hr and 60 hr post-treatment E-64d was found to inhibit ORF1 polyprotein processing as evident from accumulation of the ~192 kDa fragment (Fig. 3A and 3B, lanes 2 and 4). Western blotting with anti-His antibody revealed that addition of E-64d resulted in loss of the processed 98, 35 and 22 kDa fragments, while there was accumulation of the 47 kDa fragment at both time points (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). Under the same conditions and at similar times all processed fragments were observed in untreated cells (Fig. 3A lanes 1 and 3 respectively), while none of the fragments were seen in cells infected with the wt virus (Fig. 3A lanes 5 and 6). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in E-64d treated, untreated or wt virus infected cells, as seen on Coomassie Blue stained gels (data not shown). The E-64d effect studied using anti-FLAG antibodies also showed accumulation of the ~192 kDa polyprotein in inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Further, compared to untreated cells, it showed disappearance of the 106, 93 and 59 kDa fragments, with accumulation of the 122 and 26 kDa fragments (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). In addition, at the 60 hr time point, partially processed intermediates of ~130–140 kDa were also observed in the presence of E-64d (Fig. 3B, lane 4). As earlier, no background was observed in wt infected cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Based on these results, various cysteine and non-cysteine protease sites were mapped on the ORF1 polyprotein (Fig. 4).Purification of protein fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis ::: ResultsProtein fragments containing the His-tag were partially purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. After establishing their identity using anti-His antibodies, the 35-kDa fragment was eluted from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Nine tryptic peptides were selected from the mass spectrum (Fig. 5A) and compared for their experimentally obtained and predicted masses (Fig. 5B). These predicted sequences matched the N- terminal region of the ORF1 polyprotein spanning amino acids 70 – 339, including the predicted MeT domain. As shown earlier (Fig. 2C), the 35-kDa fragment also stained with antibodies generated to the ORF1 MeT region spanning nucleotides 159 to 862 [16]. This antibody showed a staining pattern similar to that observed with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 2A).DiscussionIn all plus-strand animal RNA viruses, individual proteins are processed from the nonstructural polyprotein through specific and limited proteolysis. Based on sequence homology, proposed domains and replication mechanism, HEV is closely related to alpha viruses with the Rubella virus being its closest homologue [12]. Previous studies relating to the HEV ORF1 polyprotein processing have shown that it is not processed in mammalian cells [15,16]. Despite the absence of processing, baculovirus mediated expression of a 110 kDa ORF1 protein has been shown to contain a methyltransferase activity [13]. Many mammalian proteins have been expressed in their native and active forms using recombinant baculoviruses [18]. Further, the baculovirus system has also been utilized to study the expression and processing of the polyproteins of other viruses, including the rubella viruses [19-23]. This system also offers post-translational modifications that are similar to those in mammalian cells, yet is capable of expressing much higher quantities of the recombinant protein [18]. Because of this increased signal to noise ratio, we used baculovirus-mediated expression to study HEV-ORF1 processing.DiscussionUnlike earlier reports, processing of the HEV nonstructural ORF1 polyprotein into smaller fragments was detected using antibodies to the engineered N- and C- terminal tags. A pattern of processing similar to that observed with anti-His antibodies was also observed with antibodies directed against the MeT domain. This was expected since MeT is the N-terminal domain of ORF1, and is closest to the His-tag in this construct. To further check the authenticity of processing, we performed a kinetic study of the protein expression following recombinant baculovirus infection. The ~192 kDa tagged polyprotein and at least two smaller fragments of 98 and 47 kDa appeared faintly at 24 hpi. This indicated rapid, possibly cotranslational processing since the polyhedrin promoter, under which ORF1 is placed, gets activated at around 24 hpi. The polyprotein synthesis and appearance of the processed products increased at 48 hpi and subsequent times in agreement with the characteristics of this expression system. At later times, smaller N-terminal fragments of 35 and 22 kDa were also found. This represents a precursor-product relationship, indicative of polyprotein processing. Similar observations were made when processing was monitored from the C-terminal end of the polyprotein.DiscussionSince the ORF1 polyprotein has a predicted cysteine protease domain and cis-acting proteases are found within the nonstructural polyproteins of all other positive-strand RNA viruses [23-28], it is likely that the cysteine protease within the ORF1 polyprotein is responsible for its processing. A cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64d, was also able to effectively block processing of the ORF1 polyprotein. Together with our kinetic data of rapid, possibly cotranslational processing of the ORF1 polyprotein, this is suggestive of a cis-acting cysteine protease within the HEV nonstructural polyprotein.DiscussionDuring a time course of E-64d inhibition of processing, the ~192 kDa and 47 kDa fragments observed with anti-His antibodies were found to accumulate. This suggested that cysteine protease sites occurred at 22, 35, and 98 kDa, while a non-cysteine protease site occurred at 47 kDa from the N-terminus of the tagged ORF1 polyprotein. When probed from the C-terminus with anti-FLAG antibodies, the E-64d treated cells exhibited strong accumulation of the ~192 kDa polyprotein, as well as fragments of 122 and 26 kDa. This meant that non-cysteine protease sites existed at these distances from the C-terminus of the tagged ORF1 polyprotein, while cysteine protease sites were present around 106, 93 and 59 kDa from the C-terminal end. The ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment disrupts the MeT coding region. From the present analysis, it is not clear whether this is due to nonspecific activity of the HEV protease or due to a host cell cysteine protease. Similarly, an ~26 kDa C-terminal fragment that disrupts the RdRp region is the likely product of a non-cysteine host protease. Though our results do not unequivocally prove the cysteine protease activity to have a viral origin, we clearly demonstrate ORF1 polyprotein processing. As is the case with other positive-strand RNA viruses [25-28], these results suggest a role for viral and host cell proteases in processing of the HEV ORF1 nonstructural polyprotein.DiscussionIn order to further validate the processing, a 35 kDa fragment was analyzed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. The results showed high confidence match with the MeT domain of ORF1 and this was confirmed by western blotting with anti-HEV MeT region antibodies.DiscussionSome earlier studies [15,16] have failed to detect ORF1 polyprotein processing. This has led Ropp et al [15] to speculate that the proposed cysteine protease within the HEV nonstructural polyprotein is non-functional and that HEV is different from all other positive-strand RNA viruses with respect to the processing of its nonstructural polyprotein. This has important implications for the classification of HEV within the positive-strand RNA virus group. Three lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, using an infectious molecular clone of HEV, Panda et al [17] were able to detect proteins smaller than the 185 kDa ORF1 polyprotein with antisera prepared against recombinant methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp domains expressed in bacteria. Secondly, a 37 kDa protein identified with anti-HEV RdRp antibodies was observed in cells transfected with the HEV ORF1-EGFP replicon [29]. We present the third line of evidence in this study by demonstrating that the ORF1 polyprotein is capable of being processed and that a cysteine protease is partly responsible for this. We do understand that the baculovirus-mediated expression system employed in this study is not the natural expression system for HEV. It was used here because of our apprehension that earlier failures to observe ORF1 processing were either due to improper folding of the polyprotein expressed in prokaryotic systems, or due to low levels of expression in transfected mammalian cells. The baculovirus system offered the advantage of high expression levels and close to native post-translational modifications and protein conformation.DiscussionA comparison of all the studies on ORF1 polyprotein processing [15-17,29], including this one, also suggests the interesting possibility that polyprotein processing in the context of an infectious virus cycle [17] may require far less protein than when ORF1 is expressed on its own [15,16]. This may be due to subcellular compartmentation leading to high local concentrations of the protein precursor or due to assistance from other viral and/or cellular proteins, or some combination of these mechanisms.DiscussionWhen expressed using a baculovirus system, our results presented here show that even when expressed individually, the HEV ORF1 polyprotein undergoes processing. This processing is primarily mediated by a cysteine protease. Additional data is needed to conclusively establish the viral origin of this protease. To further establish this, there would be a need to over-express the ORF1 polyprotein in a mammalian cell system and to use more sensitive detection methods.ConclusionWhile the HEV nonstructural ORF1 polyprotein carries at least four putative functional domains, its processing has so far not been demonstrated. We reasoned this may be due to improper folding or low expression levels of the polyprotein in subgenomic expression systems attempted so far. We show here expression of the ORF1 polyprotein using a baculovirus system and demonstrate processing using engineered tags, a domain-specific antibody and mass spectrometric identification of a processed fragment. A papain-like cysteine protease is predicted within the ORF1 polyprotein. We present evidence here for the role of a cysteine protease in ORF1 polyprotein processing; the viral origin of this protease remains to be established. These results have implications for the classification of HEV among positive-sense RNA viruses.Materials ::: MethodsSf21 and T. ni cells (Invitrogen) were maintained at 28°C in TNMFH (Gibco, BRL) and Excel 405 (JRH Biosciences) media, respectively. Antibodies to the hexahistidine and FLAG tags were purchased from Sigma. A rabbit serum containing polyclonal antibodies against the methyltransferase region of HEV ORF1 have been described earlier [16]. The Ni-NTA resin was obtained from Qiagen (Germany). All common molecular biology and cell culture grade reagents were from Sigma, unless specified otherwise.Construction of the ORF1 recombinant baculovirus ::: MethodsThe ~5 kb ORF1 was PCR amplified using Gene Amp XL PCR kit (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems) according to the suppliers guidelines. Besides other components, the reaction mix included 20 pmoles of each primer and 1 mM Mg(OAc)2. The amplification primers were designed based on alignments of the 5' and 3' ends of ORF1 in the HEV genomic sequence (GenBank Accession Number AF459438) [30]. The primers used for the amplification were EcoRI-ORF1-5', TACGGAATTCATGGAGGCCCATCAGTTTATCAAG and Hind III-ORF1-3', CCAAAGCTTTGATTTCACCCGACACAAGATTGA, containing the underlined restriction sites. The PCR amplified fragment was initially cloned in the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). To position a FLAG tag at the 3'end of ORF1, the FLAG epitope was first reconstructed by annealing the oligonucleotides AGCTTAACTACAAGGACGACGACGATAAGTAACTCGAG and TCGACTCGAGTTACTTATCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATA. The annealed product was ligated with the vector pBBHis-2b (Invitrogen) at its HindIII and SalI sites. The PCR-amplified ORF1 fragment with EcoRI and HindIII ends was then cloned into this modified vector. The recombinant vector, pBB-ORF1 so generated, contained ORF1 flanked by hexahistidine and FLAG tags at its 5' and 3' ends respectively in a continuous reading frame (Fig. 1). The insert was sequenced to confirm the junction sequences and the translation frame before using this transfer vector for generating the recombinant baculovirus. The procedure used to construct the recombinant ORF1 baculovirus, vORF1 was essentially the same as suggested for the Bac-N-Blue DNA Transfection kit (Invitrogen). Essentially, 4 μg of recombinant plasmid (pBB-ORF1) was incubated with 0.5 μg of Bac-N-blue- DNA and Celfectin reagent (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 20 min for the formation of the DNA-liposome complex. This mixture was overlayed on Sf21 cells in 60 mm dishes in serum-free medium and was incubated for 4 hrs at 27°C. Following transfection, 1 ml of complete TNM-FH medium was added and incubated further at 27°C for 72 h. Recombinant virus was harvested by collecting the medium and subsequently used for two rounds of plaque purification followed by the recombinant virus amplification as described earlier [31]. This stock of virus called vORF1 was used for infection of T. ni cells to express ORF1 for studying its processing.Virus infection and analysis ::: MethodsTo study ORF1 expression and processing, 1 × 106 T. ni cells were infected with 10 moi of vORF1 for 1 hour, following which the virus was replaced with Excel 405 medium. For a time-course, the infected cells were harvested at 24, 48, 60 and 72 hours post-infection (hpi). Cell lysates were prepared in SDS gel loading buffer, lysates equivalent to 30 μg of total proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed with anti-His-AP conjugate (Sigma) that was detected using NBT and BCIP substrates (Gibco, BRL), or with anti-FLAG or anti-MeT antibodies. These blots were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz), respectively and developed using diaminobenzidine. To test for effect of the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d, T. ni cells were infected with vORF1 for 12 hours, after which time the virus was removed. Fresh medium containing either E-64d dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 200 μM or DMSO alone was added to the cells. Cells infected with wild type AcMNPV were treated similarly. The cells were allowed to grow for 48 and 60 hours post-treatment, then harvested and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with anti-His or anti-FLAG antibodies as described above.Purification of His-tagged ORF1 fragments ::: MethodsT. ni cells in T75 flasks were infected with vORF1 at 10 moi and allowed to grow up to 48 hpi. The cells were then centrifuged, washed with PBS and stored at -80°C till further use. About 6 gm of vORF1-infected cells were suspended in 12 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 and 300 mM NaCl. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice, the lysates centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a SA600 rotor (Sorvall) for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The proteins present in the lysates were then bound with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Germany) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, for one hour at 4°C. After binding, the resin-lysate mixture was poured into a column and washed with washing buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM Imidazole. Following this wash, the bound proteins were eluted in 0.5 ml fractions with an elution buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole. The purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blotting with anti-His antibody.Mass spectrometry and peptide fingerprinting ::: MethodsThe Ni-NTA purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained using the Silver Quest staining kit (Invitrogen). A 35 kDa band confirmed on western blot with anti-His antibody was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis using a Bruker ultraflex MALDI-TOF-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The peptide Mass tool  was used to generate theoretical peptide profile of HEV ORF1 after cleaving with trypsin. These data were compared to experimentally obtained peptide masses. The MS analysis was carried out by TCGA, New Delhi.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsDS and SJ conceived of the study, analyzed the results and wrote the manuscript.

In vitro inhibition of human influenza A virus replication by chloroquine,"FindingsAntiviral drugs against influenza virus play an important role in the treatment and prevention of human influenza infection. The adamantanes have been used for decades and resistance to this class of drugs has become prevalent in some parts of the world [1]. The neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, is currently regarded as the first line of defence against a pandemic until a suitable vaccine can be produced in sufficient quantities. Emergence of resistance to this drug in human influenza A viruses [2], as well as the H5N1 subtype in Vietnam [3] is thus a cause for concern. Resistance has not been reported for zanamivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor [4]. Expanding the range of antiviral drugs that effectively inhibit influenza A virus replication is thus a matter of urgency.FindingsA recent review has suggested that the anti-malarial drug, chloroquine, may have antiviral activity [5]. As a lysosomotropic weak base, it impairs replication of some viruses through reducing the efficiency of endosome-mediated virus entry or through inhibiting the low-pH dependent proteases in trans-Golgi vesicles [5]. Its antiviral activities against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [6] and the SARS coronavirus have been demonstrated [7,8]. Previously, chloroquine had been used to study influenza virus replication in vitro [9]. However, the 0.1 mM concentration used was too high to indicate its therapeutic usefulness [9]. We thus carried out an in vitro antiviral assay to determine the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentration (IC50 and IC90, respectively) of chloroquine against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2.FindingsThe in vitro antiviral screening assay was modified from a previously described method [10] and carried out in triplicates. Influenza A viruses H1N1 (ATCC: VR1520) and H3N2 (ATCC: VR544) were used in this study. Briefly, 50 μl of serial 2-fold dilutions of the chloroquine were incubated overnight with 100 μl of MDCK cells giving a final cell count of 30,000 cells per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (Nunc A/S Roskilde, Denmark), for the drug to equilibrate with the cells. 50 μl of virus at a concentration of 100 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID50) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. Viral replication was assessed by 2 methods: real-time RT-PCR using a previously described protocol [11] was carried out on nucleic acid extracted from the supernatant of the culture, using the Roche Lightcycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany); FITC-labeled anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used to stain the remaining cell monolayer and viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. Controls consisting of virus and cell only, cell only, virus only and serial 2-fold dilution of amantadine in place of chloroquine were included in each plate. Cytotoxicity of the drugs was also assessed at all concentrations used in the antiviral assay.FindingsThe results are shown in Table 1 (see additional file 1). Cellular toxicity was observed at a chloroquine concentration of 25 μM but not at higher dilutions. Complete inhibition of influenza A virus H1N1 and H3N2 replication was observed at 12.5 μM chloroquine. This was evident microscopically with the absence of immunofluorescent focus as well as a similar Ct value on real-time RT-PCR as the virus only control. The number of fluorescent foci increased with decreasing concentration of chloroquine and this is similarly reflected in the decrease in Ct value of the real time RT-PCR of their respective supernatant. The IC50 and IC90 of chloroquine against H1N1 are 3.6 μM and 9.9 μM, respectively, while those for H3N2 are 0.84 μM and 2.4 μM, respectively.FindingsOnly a handful of drugs are able to inhibit influenza A virus replication and the increasing prevalence of resistance to these drugs demands newer classes of anti-influenza drugs. Although new compounds are still being developed and their anti-influenza activity assessed, these may take years to fulfill the regulatory requirements before clinical use can be initiated. An alternative to this mode of drug discovery may be to find new uses for old drugs, where the availability of extensive experience with their clinical use may shorten the duration needed for the various phases of clinical trials. Chloroquine serves as such an example. Our results suggest that chloroquine has a clinically useful inhibitory activity against influenza A virus replication.FindingsThe IC50 and IC90 for both the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are lower than the plasma concentration of chloroquine that can be attained with dosages used in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute malaria [12]. This suggests that the dosages needed to inhibit human influenza A virus replication should be well tolerated by patients.FindingsAn added effect of chloroquine is its immunomodulatory activity [5]. This may have an added benefit for the treatment of influenza A (H5N1) infection since the pathology of avian influenza infection in humans appears to be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines [13].FindingsAlthough we have shown that chloroquine is able to inhibit two reference subtypes of influenza A viruses, testing the susceptibility of a wide range of clinical isolates of influenza A viruses to chloroquine, as well as in vivo studies, would be needed to determine the role, if any, of chloroquine in the prophylaxis and treatment against influenza infection. It would also be interesting to determine the activity of chloroquine against the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype as this would add to the very limited antiviral stockpile against a possible pandemic.FindingsIn conclusion, chloroquine demonstrates an inhibitory effect against the replication of human influenza A virus H1N1 and H3N2, in vitro and further studies to explore its therapeutic and prophylactic potential against influenza epidemics and pandemics should be encouraged.AbbreviationsTCID50: 50% tissue culture infectivity dose; IC50: concentration of chloroquine needed to inhibit 50% of viral growth; IC90: concentration of chloroquine needed to inhibit 90% of viral growth; RT-PCR: Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. IFA: immunofluorescence assay.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEEO designed the study and wrote the manuscript.

Amphotropic murine leukemia virus is preferentially attached to cholesterol-rich microdomains after binding to mouse fibroblasts,"Retroviral vectors carrying the envelope protein of amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) are some of the most widely used retroviral vector pseudotypes in gene therapy trials. Achievement of controlled but efficient gene delivery will, however, depend on a detailed insight into virus biology. We have previously shown that A-MLV entry is closely associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains like rafts and caveolae [1] and that A-MLV envelope protein is associated with rafts in infected cells suggesting a possible role of rafts in A-MLV assembly [2]. It has also been shown for other viruses that rafts and/or caveolae are important for their entry and assembly [3-8]; specifically, has caveola-mediated entry been shown for, e.g., SV40 [4], echovirus 1 [7], and human coronavirus 229E [8]. Both domains consist of high concentrations of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ganglioside GM1, and other saturated lipids [9,10] but in contrast to rafts do caveolae build omega-shaped invaginations within the plasma membrane of cells [11]. The unique lipid composition of rafts and caveolae leads to the specific incorporation or exclusion of proteins in these domains thereby creating distinct microenvironments for cellular processes [10,11].BackgroundStudying SV40 entry it was found that viral entry via caveolae occurs through an endocytic mechanism and that it – in comparison to an endocytic entry via clathrin-coated pits – is a cholesterol-dependent, pH-independent, and slow process [4]. We also found these hallmarks of caveolae-mediated entry when studying A-MLV entry of fibroblastic cells [1]. Association of the viral receptor with caveolae would seem essential for viral entry through caveolae and our previous investigations also showed that the A-MLV receptor protein Pit2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, is able to directly associate with caveolin-1 (cav-1) [1], one of the major structural proteins of caveolae [11]. However, the omega-like shape of caveolae and their average size of around 70 nm would suggest that A-MLV with its diameter of about 110 nm binds outside of caveolae. As rafts are suggested to be pre-caveolae [11] and a large fraction of the A-MLV receptor Pit2 was found associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains [1], we have here investigated if rafts and caveolae are involved in the early steps of A-MLV binding.ResultsFirst, we wanted to investigate if A-MLV binds to cholesterol-rich microdomains. Therefore, NIH3T3 cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C with fluorescently labeled A-MLV (GagYFP A-MLV) containing a nucleocapsid protein fused with yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) [12]. After subsequent washing and fixation, the cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled cholera toxin (CTX). This is a standard procedure for staining of cholesterol-rich microdomains since CTX binds specifically to GM1, a marker of rafts and caveolae [13]. As shown in figure 1A, cell-bound A-MLV showed a pronounced attachment to large GM1-positive microdomains. As GM1 is a general marker for cholesterol-rich microdomains, we investigated if these regions of preferred A-MLV binding were also enriched in caveolin-1 (cav-1), a major structural protein of caveolae. NIH3T3 cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV particles, washed, fixed, and permeabilized. Subsequently, the cells were stained for cav-1 and investigated using confocal microscopy. As expected a part of GagYFP A-MLV particles co-localized with cav-1 could be observed, however, cav-1 was not enriched at the favored binding sites of GagYFP A-MLV (Fig. 1B). The same was true for GagYFP A-MLV bound to NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a cav-1 mRed fusion protein (Fig. 1C). From these data, we suggest that rafts rather than caveolae are involved in the early steps of A-MLV binding.ResultsInterestingly, in many investigated cells the stained cholesterol-rich microdomains appeared as large patched regions within the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 1A). As the cells were fixed before staining with CTX, we could exclude a patching of smaller rafts due to CTX binding. However, it is known, that binding of ligands or viruses to their raft-associated receptor can lead to patching of smaller raft domains [14,15]. We therefore investigated whether virus binding lead to patching of GM1-rich microdomains. As a control, we included VSV-G pseudotyped GagYFP MLV particles (here referred to as GagYFP VSV); VSV enters cells via clathrin-coated pits [16] and binding of these viral particles to the cells should therefore not lead to patching of cholesterol-rich microdomains. Thus, VSV or A-MLV pseudotypes of GagYFP MLV cores were added to NIH3T3 at 37°C, and after 30 minutes the cells were washed, fixed, and stained for GM1 with fluorescently labeled CTX. Confocal microscopy revealed that large cholesterol-rich microdomains were present in cells incubated with both VSV and A-MLV (Fig. 2). The same was true for NIH3T3 cells incubated with viral like particles lacking viral envelope proteins (data not shown). But in comparison to A-MLV, neither VSV nor viral like particles lacking viral envelope proteins showed preferential attachment to large rafts. Thus, while binding of A-MLV to the large raft regions seems to be A-MLV envelope specific, it did not lead to the formation of the large rafts.ResultsAs rafts are enriched in cholesterol and cholesterol has been shown to be important for A-MLV entry [1], we wanted to investigate, if cholesterol was important for the preferential binding of A-MLV to the large raft regions. Therefore, we treated NIH3T3 cells with 10 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), which is known to extract cholesterol out of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells [17]. After this treatment, the cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV for 30 min at 37°C, washed, fixed, and stained for GM1 with fluorescently labeled CTX. Although we have previously shown that this treatment is sufficient to extract up to 70 percent of the plasma membrane cholesterol of NIH3T3 cells [1], large raft regions were still present (Fig. 3). In addition, A-MLV showed the same binding pattern as in the experiments in figures 1 and 2 demonstrating that depletion of cholesterol alone was not sufficient to prevent A-MLV binding to the large raft regions.DiscussionThe A-MLV replication cycle is closely associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains like rafts and caveolae. We have previously shown that A-MLV can enter mouse fibroblasts through caveola-mediated endocytosis and that the A-MLV envelope protein is associated with rafts in infected cells [1,2]. Here, we have furthermore demonstrated that rafts are involved in A-MLV binding.DiscussionUsing confocal microscopy we found that A-MLV binds preferentially to large GM1-positive membrane regions of NIH3T3 cells, which are most likely rafts. Cav-1 staining of NIH3T3 cells as well as NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a cav-1 mRed fusion protein revealed that cav-1 was not enriched at the favored binding sites of A-MLV. Interestingly, the large rafts were not a result of virus induced aggregation of smaller rafts (raft patching). NIH3T3 cells incubated together with VSV or with viral particles lacking a viral envelope protein had the same large GM1-positive domains as cells incubated with A-MLV. As VSV enters and infects cells via clathrin-coated pits [16], binding of VSV should not lead to any patching of rafts. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of large rafts in NIH3T3 cells is not a result of A-MLV binding. Raft patching is especially known from investigations of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the T cell coreceptor CD4. It has been shown that crosslinking of TCR and CD4 by antibodies as well as incubation of T cells with CTX lead to raft patching [18-20]. As we fixed the cells prior to staining with CTX, we can exclude that the large rafts are artifacts caused by the staining procedure. It should also be noted that large rafts were not present in other cell lines like 293T (human kidney cell line) or MDTF (Mus dunni tail fibroblasts) regardless of A-MLV binding (data not shown).DiscussionThe origin of the large rafts in NIH3T3 cells is not known. However, raft patching occurs mainly through ligand-receptor interactions or other protein-protein interactions [14,15] and it is possible that proteins from serum or the presence of a prominent extracellular matrix associated with rafts could lead to raft patching and the appearance of large rafts in NIH3T3 cells. Raft patching in NIH3T3 cells induced by pronounced protein-protein interactions would indeed explain the resistance of these large domains to extraction of plasma membrane cholesterol with MBCD. Thus, it is likely that a complex and rigid protein network could preserve large rafts from disintegration even in the absence of cholesterol. In addition, A-MLV binding to large rafts was independent of plasma membrane cholesterol indicating that the A-MLV receptor Pit2 or other virus interacting proteins were still present in these regions. All vector particles used in the present study were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells and since A-MLV but not VSV or viral particles lacking viral envelope proteins showed favored binding to large rafts, we conclude that this is due to the presence of A-MLV envelope protein on the particles and therefore most likely due to the presence of Pit2 in these regions. Furthermore, in comparison to A-MLV only a small amount of VSV particles were cell-bound at the time of investigation. This is probably due to the faster entry of VSV into cells since we have previously shown that VSV particles enter NIH3T3 cells 4 times faster than A-MLV [1]. In addition, to ensure that the reason for the observed differences in A-MLV and VSV binding was not due to a lesser amount of VSV particles we also have incubated cells with lesser quantities of A-MLV. As expected, the amount of cell-bound A-MLV decreased but a high amount of the cell-bound particles were still found attached to large rafts (data not shown).DiscussionWhile we previously demonstrated that the major entry route of A-MLV in NIH3T3 cells is via caveola [1], we here found that the vast majority of cell-bound A-MLV virions associated with GM1-positive regions and not with cav-1-positive regions. Indeed, the amount of A-MLV particles associated with large rafts within 30 minutes of virus exposure suggests that rafts are involved in early events of A-MLV binding and that A-MLV virions bind to the cells outside of caveolae and subsequently associate with caveolae in the entry process. Furthermore, in agreement with the slow infection kinetic of A-MLV these data also suggest that transport of A-MLV from rafts to caveolae is a limiting step in A-MLV entry.ConclusionTaken together, our results show that A-MLV binds preferentially to large rafts in NIH3T3 suggesting involvement of these microdomains in early steps of A-MLV binding.Cells ::: MethodsNIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with glutamine and 10% Newborn Calf Serum (NCS). 293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) were propagated in DMEM supplemented with glutamine and 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). All cells were grown at 37°C, 10% CO2 and 95% humidity.Cells ::: MethodsTo stably express a cav-1 mRed fusion protein NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with a construct encoding the cav-1 mRed fusion protein [21] and the pSV2pac plasmid encoding puromycin resistance gene [22].

Selection of a set of reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids,"Gene expression analysis has become increasingly important in biological research where e.g. gene expression profiles from tissues associated with diseases and disorders have to be compared with each other and with those from normal tissues. One of the most powerful tools in this area is real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To account for differences in starting material, RNA preparation, RNA quality and cDNA synthesis, adequate normalisation is frequently performed by comparing expression profiles of the genes of interest with those of constitutively expressed genes (= reference genes). Housekeeping genes are most widely used as reference genes, based on the assumption that they are constitutively expressed in most tissues and under certain circumstances, and that they are more or less resistant to cell cycle fluctuations [1,2]. However, it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of these genes may vary considerably in different tissues, different cell types and different disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease [3,4]. Housekeeping genes are not only involved in the basal cell metabolism, but appear to participate in other functions too, and therefore are prone to regulation [5-7]. Especially in tumours, the metabolism is generally elevated because of permanent proliferation and expansion. Moreover, some housekeeping genes may have a specific function essential for the tumour metabolism and therefore be up or down regulated [8]. Because of these findings, Vandesompele et al [9] proposed to identify a set of stable housekeeping genes in the tissue of interest and use them as internal reference genes for accurate normalisation.BackgroundUp till now, only a few gene expression studies using real-time qRT-PCR have been performed in horses. GAPDH or ACTB were commonly used as a single non-validated reference gene [10-15], since at that time not much information was available concerning this issue. Recently, Waguespack et al [16] compared 4 housekeeping genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH and TBP) in the lamellae of the hoof in horses.BackgroundIn this study, 6 commonly used reference genes in both human and animal studies were investigated, both in normal skin and in equine sarcoids of horses. Equine sarcoids are fibroblastic skin tumours and are the most common tumours in horses. The disease not only induces esthetical defects, but also diminishes the economical value of affected horses [17]. Moreover affected horses show a genetic predisposition for the development of equine sarcoids, through which the breeding value of an animal with sarcoids sharply declines [18-20]. The bovine papillomavirus (BPV) plays an important role in the aetiology of equine sarcoids [21-23]. Several clinical types exist, ranging from small, stable patches to large, aggressive and fast growing tumours [24]. To be able to examine the gene expression profile of BPV in these different clinical types and to compare equine sarcoids with normal skin asymptomatically infected with BPV, a well suited internal control should first of all be established.Transcription profiling of the candidate genes ::: Results and discussioncDNA was synthesised from DNA-free RNA (checked with minus RT control) isolated from 8 normal equine skin and 8 equine sarcoid samples. A real-time PCR assay, based on SYBR® Green detection, was designed for the transcription profiling of six frequently used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32 )in these cDNA samples. During optimisation of the protocol, real-time PCR products were visualised by gelelectrophoresis and sequenced for verification. For every assay, a single amplicon with the expected size was generated without primer dimer formation. Indeed, the formation of primer dimers and unspecific amplification, which can falsely increase the gene expression levels, is a major point of attention, particularly when using intercalating dyes such as SYBR® Green.Transcription profiling of the candidate genes ::: Results and discussionAmplicon sequences of ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, and TUBA1 were 100% identical with the described sequences on which primer design was based. The sequencing of UBB revealed 1 gap and 3 SNPs compared to the original sequence (98% identity). The gap is probably due to sequencing errors; the SNPs did not result in an amino acid variation. When translated to amino acid sequence, the RPL32 sequence was 100% identical to publicly accessible horse ESTs and human RPL32 amino acid sequences.Transcription profiling of the candidate genes ::: Results and discussionAfter optimisation, gene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melt-curve analysis. For each assay, a standard curve was generated by using 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA, generated of both normal skin and equine sarcoid tissue, characterised by a linear correlation coefficient (R2) varying from 0.991 to 0.998 and a PCR efficiency between 88.1 and 104.6%. These findings showed that these assays are suitable for quantitative purposes.Transcription profiling of the candidate genes ::: Results and discussionIn order to select a reliable set of reference genes, each assay was performed in duplicate and included the appropriate control samples. To compare the transcription level of the selected genes across the different samples, the Ct values, ranging from 16.4 to 31.4 were converted into raw data based on the PCR efficiency, gathered by standard curve analyses.GeNorm analysis ::: Results and discussionThe gene expression stability over the different samples was analysed using the geNorm software [9]. The ranking of the 6 candidate reference genes according to their M value was not equivalent between the normal skin samples, the equine sarcoid samples and the combination of both kinds of samples. For normal skin ACTB, TUBA1 and UBB were the 3 most stable genes (Figure 1A(a)). In equine sarcoids on the other hand, ACTB, B2M and UBB proved to be the most stable genes with TUBA1 being the least stable gene (Figure 1B(a)). When both sets of samples were analysed together, the results showed that the combination of 3 genes (ACTB, UBB and B2M) is sufficient for adequate normalisation (Figure 1C(a)). The results are listed in Table 1. In another study [16], where ACTB, B2M, GAPDH and TBP were compared as reference genes, ACTB and B2M were found to be the best endogenous control genes for real-time qPCR of lamella in the hoof of horses.GeNorm analysis ::: Results and discussionWhen calculating a normalisation factor (NF), a careful choice of the number of reference genes should be made. The more genes included, the more accurate the NF is. However, including too many genes may increase the risk of using unsuitable genes, and is also impractical. On the other hand, if the cut off is made too stringent, stably expressed reference genes may be excluded and accuracy might drop. In order to determine how many reference genes should be included, normalisation factors (NFn), based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the n best reference genes, were calculated by inclusion of an extra, less stable, reference gene according to Vandesompele et al [9]. Figures 1A(b), 1B(b) and 1C(b) show the pairwise variation Vn/Vn+1 between 2 sequential normalisation factors NFn and NFn+1 for normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both kinds of samples. In all 3 cases, the inclusion of a 4th gene had no significant contribution (low V3/4 value) to the NF. The 3 member sets as described above are a good choice for the calculation of the NF.Implementation of results in clinical research ::: Results and discussionFor the reasons discussed above, we have confidence that our gene expression results are accurate and reliable. The described set of reference genes can be used in gene expression studies both in normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both. One of the points of interest in veterinary medicine is the expression level of BPV in different kinds of equine sarcoids. With the normalisation technique described in this study, reliable results can be obtained. Another research topic in this domain is the study of BPV expression in normal skin, showing latent infection with BPV. Also, the expression level of specific horse genes with a putative role in tumourigenesis, can be investigated.ConclusionIn conclusion, a method for genomic DNA-free RNA extraction from normal equine skin and equine sarcoids was optimised and a reference gene assay for reliable normalisation of real-time qPCR data, obtained from normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both, was designed. The profiling of the gene expression pattern of 6 putative reference genes showed that 3 reference genes should be used. ACTB, TUBA1 and UBB can be used in normal skin, while ACTB, B2M and UBB are the best choice in equine sarcoids. If normal skin and equine sarcoids have to be compared, the same member set as proposed for equine sarcoids can be used.Sample collection ::: MethodsEight equine sarcoid samples were obtained from surgically treated horses. A whole range of tumours were sampled (one occult type, one verrucous type, one nodular type and five fibroblastic types). Three sarcoids were located on the medial part of the thigh, two in the axilla and two on the ventral side of the abdomen. Care was taken to obtain only tumoural tissue, without underlying normal stroma. Normal skin samples were obtained from healthy horses undergoing elective surgery or euthanasia (umbilical hernia, castration, osteochondrosis dissecans, dorsal displacement of the soft palatinum). Six of the samples were collected from the ventral abdomen, one from the throat region and one from the shoulder. All samples were freshly collected and stored immediately in RNAlater (Ambion). After overnight incubation at +4°C, the samples were frozen at -18°C until RNA extraction.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis ::: MethodsTotal RNA was isolated from the samples using TRIR (ABgene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, approximately 4 μg of the total RNA solution, measured with the BioPhotometer (Eppendorf), were treated with 3 units DNase I (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. This was followed by a spin-column purification (Microcon YM-10, Millipore). A minus RT control with primers for GAPDH was performed to check for successful removal of all the contaminating DNA. These primers were designed by the Primer 3 software [25] using publicly available sequences from the Nucleotide Sequence Database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [26]. The initial denaturation was performed at 94°C for 10 minutes. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed. Each cycle involved a denaturation step of 30 seconds at 94°C, followed by 30 seconds primer annealing at 61°C and 60 seconds primer extension at 72°C. After the last cycle, the PCR-mix was heated during 10 minutes at 72°C to become extension of the partially elongated primers.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis ::: MethodsFirst strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on approximately 2.6 μg of the total RNA solution with Superscript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), an engineered version of M-MLV RT, and a combination of random primers (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl, following the manufacturer's instructions. After this step, a PCR was performed with primers for GAPDH to check for the presence of cDNA. The reaction conditions used in this PCR were identical to the PCR described for the minus RT control.Reference gene selection and primer design ::: MethodsSix reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32) belonging to different functional classes were selected to reduce the chance that these genes might be co-regulated (Table 2).Reference gene selection and primer design ::: MethodsThe primers, based on horse RNA and DNA sequences found in the NCBI database [26], were designed by the Primer 3 software [25]. The specificity of the primers was tested using a BLAST analysis against the genomic NCBI database. The complete nucleotide sequences of the genes of interest were characterised using Mfold [27] to take into account possible secondary structures at the primer binding sites which might influence the PCR efficiency. The PCR products were cloned (pCR 2.1 vector, Invitrogen) and sequenced for verification (Thermo Sequenase Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit, Amersham Bioscience) with an ALF Express sequencer (Amersham Bioscience). Technical information about the primers and amplicons are listed in Table 3.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsEight normal skin samples and eight equine sarcoid samples were used for quantification of reference genes.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsPCR reactions were performed in a 15 μl reaction volume on the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using the Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.02 μM fluorescein and 20 ng of cDNA. Primer concentration varied according to the primers used. A blank was incorporated in each assay.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsFirst, an UDG-treatment was done at 50°C to prevent cross contamination. The initial denaturation was performed at 95°C for 2 minutes to activate the Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds and a combined primer annealing/extension at the specific annealing temperature (Table 3) for 40 seconds during which fluorescence was measured. A melt curve was generated to confirm a single gene-specific peak and to detect primer dimer formation by heating the samples from 70 to 95°C in 0.5°C increments with a dwell time at each temperature of 10 seconds while continuously monitoring the fluorescence.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsPCR efficiencies were calculated using a relative standard curve derived from a pooled cDNA mixture (a ten-fold dilution series with four measuring points). The pooled cDNA was obtained from normal equine skin and equine sarcoids, using the same RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis protocols as described above.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsEach reaction was run in duplicate, whereby a no-template control was included.Real-time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsDuring optimisation of the protocol, the PCR products were loaded on a 3% agarose gel after each run to confirm specific gene amplification and the absence of primer dimer formation.Determination of reference gene expression stability ::: MethodsTo determine the stability of the selected reference genes, the geNorm Visual Basic application for Microsoft Excel was used as described by Vandesompele et al [9]. This approach relies on the principle that the expression ratio of two perfect reference genes should be identical in all samples, independent of the experimental condition or cell type.Authors' contributionsLB was the primary author of the manuscript, was responsible for the primer design and determined the study design.

Combined fluticasone propionate and salmeterol reduces RSV infection more effectively than either of them alone in allergen-sensitized mice,"Asthma is a chronic lung disease with two distinct features – airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness [1,2]. An association between viral upper-respiratory infections (URIs) and exacerbations of asthma has been reported [3,4]. The most commonly identified viruses in these studies include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5]. RSV is the predominant cause of URIs in infants below 2 years of age and infection may result in bronchiolitis, which is a risk factor for asthma [6-12]. RSV may constitute the earliest trigger for the development of a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-dominant immune response, which is the hallmark of immunopathology in allergic subjects including asthmatics, and also in rodent models [13]. URIs cause a decrease in peak flow that lags behind upper airway symptoms by 1–2 days, with 46% of subjects in one study reporting a two day lag in peak flow reduction [14].IntroductionA combination therapy involving a long-acting β2 agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) has emerged as an effective asthma management strategy to control persistent asthma [15]. A combination of salmeterol (Sal) and fluticasone propionate (FP) was found to be superior to either of them alone [16,17]. The combination is also significantly more effective than montelukast plus FP or monotherapy with inhaled budesonide [18]. The increased effectiveness of FPS has been attributed to increased activation and translocation to the nucleus of glucocorticoid receptors [19,20]. However, the effect of these drugs on viral exacerbation in allergic asthmatics has not been studied.IntroductionThe conclusion of the Cochrane Review of available controlled trials of ICS in children with a history of mild episodic viral wheeze was that high dose ICS was partially effective for the treatment of mild episodic viral wheeze of childhood [21]. Since URIs induce exacerbations, β2-agonists may be of specific value in reducing such exacerbations. In an in vitro study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, a combination of FP and Sal reduced infection and preserved ciliated cells to a greater degree than either alone suggesting synergy between the two agents [22]. Because 80–85% of asthma exacerbations in children are associated with viral infections, early intervention with a combination therapy should have beneficial effects on viral asthma exacerbations.IntroductionSince virus-induced exacerbation is accompanied by airway inflammation, we reasoned that the combination of a steroid and a β-2 agonist might provide protection from severe RSV infection and the ensuing asthma exacerbation. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of allergen sensitization and RSV infection using OVA as the allergen [1]. Mice with chronic or acute sensitization to OVA were RSV infected and then treated with FP or Sal or the two together (FPS). Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and pulmonary inflammation were measured five days after infection. The results show that the combination of FP and Sal provides significant protection in terms of both airway hyperreactivity and pulmonary inflammation compared to either of them alone.Animals ::: MethodsFemale BALB/c mice, 4–6 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River and housed under pathogen-free conditions at the University of South Florida Vivarium. All treatment protocols were approved by the USF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).RSV preparation and infection of mice ::: MethodsThe A2 strain of human RSV (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was propagated in HEp-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Gibco) with 2% FBS. At maximum cytopathic effect, the cells were harvested in the same medium. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4°C and the resulting supernatant was layered onto a glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 hrs at 4°C. The pellet containing virus was resuspended in pre-cooled (4°C) buffer (0.22 μ-filtered 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM MgSO4, and 150 mM NaCl) and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Viral titers were determined by standard plaque assay combined with immunostaining for RSV. Mice were infected under light anesthesia by intranasal inoculation of RSV (5 × 106 PFU).OVA sensitization, RSV infection and drug treatment ::: MethodsFor experiments in which only a single RSV infection was used (therapeutic regimen), mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of OVA on day 1 and by intranasal (i.n.) administration of OVA on days 7 and 9. On day 9 the mice were infected i.n. with of RSV. From day 10 to day 13 they were treated daily i.n. with fluticasone (FP) propionate, salmeterol (Sal), or the two in combination (FPS) at 10 μg per mouse (FP and Sal were obtained from GlaxoSmithKline). Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured on day 14 and on day 15 the animals were sacrificed. For the prophylactic experiments, mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of OVA on day 1 and by intranasal (i.n.) administration of OVA on days 9, 12 and 14. On day 19 the mice were infected i.n. with of RSV. From day 21 to day 27 mice were treated daily i.n. with FP, Sal, or the two in combination (FPS) at 10 μg per mouse. On day 28, mice were reinfected with RSV and then challenged i.n. with OVA. AHR was measured on day 29. On day 30 the mice were sacrificed and BAL fluid, lungs and spleens were taken. All experiments were repeated at least twice.Determination of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) ::: MethodsAHR, expressed as enhanced pause (Penh), was measured in unrestrained mice by whole body plethysmography (Buxco, Troy, NY). Groups of mice (n = 4) were exposed for 5 min to nebulized PBS to establish a baseline then to increasing concentrations (6–50 mg/ml) of nebulized methacholine (MCh; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS. Challenges were done for 5 min followed by recordings of Penh for 5 min. The Penh values were averaged and expressed for each MCh concentration as a percentage of the PBS baseline reading.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ::: MethodsLungs were lavaged using 500 μl of PBS and the BAL fluid was kept at 4°C until processed. BAL cells were centrifuged onto microscope slides by Cytospin (Shandon) and stained using the Hema3 kit (Fisher). Eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes were counted from 5 different fields on 4 different slides from each group in a blinded fashion.Immunohistochemical analysis ::: MethodsLung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and inflammation was assessed as disruption or denudation of the epithelial layer and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes into the perialveolar region. Lung sections were also stained with antibodies to the cell-adhesion molecule ICAM-1, the goblet cell marker Muc-5A, and the Th2 marker T1/ST2 (Santa Cruz BioTech, Santa Cruz, CA).Isolation of spleen cells and intracellular cytokine staining ::: MethodsMice were sacrificed and single-cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens and cultured for 24 to 48 hrs in DMEM with 10% FBS. Splenocytes were incubated on anti-CD3-coated or OVA-coated plates for 24 h and then treated with Golgi-Stop for 4 hr to block the secretion of cytokines. Cells were surface-stained with FITC-anti-CD4 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) and then subjected to intracellular staining with PE-anti-IFN-γ, -IL10 or -IL-4 antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry gated on CD4+ cells. The percentages of CD4+ cells secreting the respective cytokines are shown.Measurement of cytokine levels in BAL cells ::: MethodsMice were sacrificed and lungs were lavaged with PBS. Aliquots of the BAL fluid were stored at -80°C until assayed. The concentration of IFN-γ in the BAL was measured by ELISA using a kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and the results were expressed as pg of IFN-γ per ml of BAL fluid.Apoptosis detection ::: MethodsLung sections were processed for detection of apoptosis using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System assay kit (Promega). Dewaxed sections were fixed and permeablized, then incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to label DNA ends with FITC-dUTP. Stained sections were photographed under a fluorescent microscope.Statistical analysis ::: MethodsAll data were expressed as mean ± SEM. For comparison of two different groups, Student's t test was used. Differences between groups were considered significant at P < 0.05.FPS is more effective than FP or Sal alone in preventing AHR and lung inflammation ::: ResultsMice were sensitized with OVA on day 1 i.p. and on day 7 and 9 i.n. On day 9 they were infected with 5 × 106 PFU RSV. From day 10 to 13 they were treated with 10 μg of FP, Sal or FP/Sal combination (FPS). AHR was measured as Penh on day 14 (Fig. 1A). On day 15 the mice were sacrificed, BAL was done and a differential cell count was performed on the BAL fluid (Fig. 1B). Lung sections were stained with H &E and examined for histopathology (Fig. 1C). Mice treated with FPS, FP and Sal all showed reduced eosinophil numbers but no change in neutrophils. Sal-treated mice showed an increase in the number of lymphocytes. Combination therapy resulted in a significant reduction in eosinophil number as well as lung inflammation compared to the other treatments. Lungs of allergen-sensitized and RSV-infected mice exhibited cellular infiltration with MNC and eosinophils (Fig. 1C).FPS is more effective than FP alone in reducing viral exacerbation of asthma ::: ResultsMice were sensitized with OVA i.p. on day 1 and on day 9, 12 and 14 i.n. On day 19 the mice were infected i.n with RSV (5 × 106 PFU). From day 21 to day 27, mice were treated i.n. with 10 μg of FP or FPS. On day 28 mice were reinfected with RSV and challenged with OVA. AHR was measured on day 29 and was lower in FPS-treated mice than those treated with FP or Sal alone (Fig. 2A). On day 30 the mice were sacrificed and BAL fluid was taken and analyzed for lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils by differential staining. Treatment with FPS reduced the number of eosinophils and neutrophils compared to either drug alone (Fig. 2B). Lung sections showed extensive epithelial disruption and cellular infiltration in the case of RSV exposure without drug treatment. FP or S alone reduced the pathology somewhat but the combination FPS was significantly more effective (Fig. 2C). The results showed that FPS significantly attenuated AHR and inflammation, as seen by the decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes and the reduced perialveolar damage compared to control group and mice treated with FP alone.Effect of FPS combination on cytokine and inflammatory marker expression ::: ResultsTo determine the effects of FPS therapy on T-cell cytokine secretion, mice were OVA-sensitized, infected with RSV and treated with FP, Sal or FPS. Mice were sacrificed after drug treatment and their splenocytes were examined for cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 3A & B). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 in panel A and with OVA in panel B. FP increased the number of cells producing IL-10 and Sal increased cells producing IL-4, whereas FPS decreased the number of cells producing IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-γ. Lung epithelial cells respond to inflammatory cytokines by expressing specific cell markers such as the intracellular adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, and the mucin gene, MUC-5A. Fig. 4 shows the results of an immunohistochemical analysis for ICAM-1 and Muc-5A in mouse lung sections. RSV infection increased the expression of ICAM-1 and mucin, whereas treatment with FPS decreased their expression compared to control mice. Another correlate of lung inflammation is the infiltration of T lymphocytes into the perialveolar tissue. A Th2-specific marker, T1/ST2, was used to stain lung sections, and both Sal and FPS appear to stimulate infiltration of T cells of the Th2 type into the lung (lower panel, Fig. 4).FPS inhibits apoptosis of lung cells ::: ResultsPrevious work from our lab documented the apoptosis of lung cells as a consequence of OVA-induced inflammation in OVA-sensitized mice. Here we sought to determine the effect of FP and Sal or the combination on this apoptosis. Mice were OVA-sensitized, RSV-infected and treated with the various drug combinations. At the end of treatment they were sacrificed, lungs were removed and sections were examined for apoptosis using the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end-labeling) assay. Fig. 5 shows a representative experiment in which apoptosis was induced in a population of cells in the lungs of OVA-sensitized, RSV-infected mice. The extent of apoptosis was reduced by treatment with FP and Sal, and especially by FPS.FPS decreases RSV titer and increases IFN-γ production ::: ResultsTwo groups of mice were sensitized with OVA i.p. and then prophylactically treated with FP, Sal or FPS prior to infection with RSV. Three days after infection, they were sacrificed. Lungs were removed from one group of mice, homogenized and the titer of RSV determined by plaque assay. BAL fluid was taken from the second group and analyzed by ELISA for IFN-γ. The decreased burden of virus in the lung tissue of FPS-treated mice was matched by an increase in secreted IFN-γ in BAL fluid (Fig. 6). Increased IFN-γ production could, at least in part, account for the reduction in RSV titer.DiscussionOur goal in this study was to determine if the combination of a corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist was more effective in reducing RSV-induced asthma exacerbation than either drug alone. Here we demonstrate a reduction in lung inflammation in OVA-allergic mice infected with RSV after treatment with combined fluticasone and salmeterol. Eosinophil migration to the lung is characteristically seen during RSV-induced exacerbation of asthma [23], and both fluticasone and salmeterol reduced the eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid; but the combination of the two drugs was most effective. The basis of this synergy and whether the combination will be effective in infants and children affected by exposure to both viruses and allergens is unclear.DiscussionOne important finding of this study is that irrespective of the frequency of RSV infection, the FPS combination therapy was effective and significantly decreased AHR as measured by % Penh. Also, in studies in which mice were infected twice with RSV, FPS decreased AHR more than FP alone. These results are in agreement with previous reports, where steroid or β2-agonists alone was found to be partially effective in RSV infection and viral induced asthma [24-26]. Consistent with the AHR data, there was a substantial reduction in pulmonary inflammation irrespective of the frequency of RSV infection. Of note is that in experiments where mice sensitized with OVA received one RSV infection, there was a decrease in eosinophils but an increase in lymphocytes. In contrast, OVA-sensitized mice that had two RSV infections before FP showed an increase in neutrophils. This is probably due to the resistance of neutrophils to corticosteroids and to the generation of a greater number of infiltrating neutrophils by the repeated RSV infection. The former possibility is consistent with the findings that neutrophilic asthma is resistant to treatment by FP [27]. This suggests that addition of the long-acting beta agonist is the agent primarily affecting recruitment of neutrophils in the combination.DiscussionFurthermore, single versus double RSV infection induced significant differences in the expression of specific cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4. RSV infection in BALB/c mice has been shown to increase a variety of cytokines and chemokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and eotaxin [28]. Mice with a single infection showed an increased percentage of IL-10-producing cells perhaps indicative of greater stimulation of the innate immune system [29]. Treatment with salmeterol alone resulted in a significantly higher percentage of IL-4-producing cells characteristic of the Th2-type response observed in human infants suffering from acute RSV bronchiolitis [30] while FPS decreased both IL-10 and IL-4. The numbers of cytokine-producing cells in splenocyte cultures are in agreement with the increased number of Th2-like cells seen in lung sections from salmeterol-treated mice. In mice infected twice with RSV, FPS reduced IL-10 but not IL-4 compared to FP or salmeterol alone-. This is consistent with our previous finding that allergic mice with two RSV infections had an increase in the number of cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 [1]. Increased IL-10 production has been associated with recurrent wheezing in children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis [31,32].DiscussionAnother significant observation is the differential effect of FP and Sal on inflammatory markers. FP treatment caused an increase in ICAM-1 expression whereas Sal showed a small decrease. Treatment with the combination resulted in a decrease of ICAM-1 expression. This observation is consistent with previous reports which showed that FPS combination decreased ICAM-1 expression in human lung fibroblast cells [33,34]. The expression of MUC-5A, which is a marker for mucus production, was also decreased by combined FPS treatment, but not significantly by either FP or Sal alone. Staining for the Th2-specific marker, T1/ST2 demonstrated the RSV-induced infiltration of Th2 cells. While treatment with FP increased ICAM-1 and MUC-5 expression, Th2 infiltration in lungs of FP-treated mice was decreased. In contrast, treatment with Sal did not inhibit Th2 infiltration. The combination FPS treatment decreased Th2 infiltration compared with Sal indicating that steroids and β2-agonists differentially affect inflammatory parameters, but that the two in combination can effectively reduce RSV-induced lung inflammation.DiscussionApoptosis of lymphocytes in the lung is a characteristic feature of RSV bronchiolitis and may increase the severity of the disease [35]. Our results indicated that compared to lungs of mice sensitized with OVA in the presence or absence of RSV infection, lungs of mice treated with either FP or Sal and the combination FPS showed a decreased number of apoptotic cells. The FPS combination shows even fewer apoptotic cells compared to FP or Sal alone suggesting the greater effectiveness of the combination treatment. The reason for this is unclear, but it may be due to the fact that treatment with FP or Sal decreases infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lungs. This idea is consistent with the report that FPS increases apoptosis of peripheral blood T cells [36].DiscussionTreatment with FP plus Sal decreases lung inflammation and examination of lung homogenates for RSV revealed a reduction in virus titer in the mice treated with FPS, suggesting that the combination treatment exerts additional antiviral effects. The measurement of IFN-γ in BAL fluid showed an increased production of IFN-γ in the lungs of mice treated with FPS therapy. Thus, the observed reduction in RSV titer may be due to increased IFN-γ levels in the lungs induced by the FPS combination therapy.DiscussionAlthough a number of experimental approaches are under investigation for the treatment of RSV infection [37-40], the possibility that such infection can be managed using already available therapies is an important finding. The results of this -study show that OVA-sensitized mice receiving fluticasone plus salmeterol had a significant reduction in RSV-induced inflammation and RSV titers compared to those receiving the drugs individually. Our results suggest that the use of a combination therapy can be very effective in reducing virally-induced asthma exacerbations.AbbreviationsFP, fluticasone propionate; Sal, salmeterol; FPS, fluticasone plus salmeterol; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; AHR, airway hyperreactivity; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; OVA, ovalbumin; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; Th2, T helper cell type 2; URI, upper respiratory infection; PFU, plaque-forming units; i.p., intraperitoneal; i.n., intranasal; Penh, enhanced pause; MCh, methacholine.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
"Antibiotic resistance as a global threat: Evidence from China, Kuwait and the United States","In 1942, the first U.S. patient with streptococcal infection was miraculously cured with a small dose of penicillin. Sixty years later, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus is widespread. Such antimicrobial resistance threatens the health of many throughout the world, since both old and new infectious diseases remain a formidable public health threat.Among the issues that merit further scrutiny for understanding the possible spread of antimicrobial resistance, few are as salient as the impact of globalization. Clearly the movement of people and goods around the globe contributes to transmission of disease [1,2]. To what extent drug resistance and globalization are similarly related remains unclear. The breakout of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003 illustrates how an infectious disease with limited therapeutic options can spread rapidly across national borders. With globalization booming, it is important to understand international patterns of resistance. If countries already experience similar patterns of resistance, it may be too late to worry about international spread. If large countries or groups of countries that are likely to leap ahead in their integration with the rest of the world – China being the standout case – have high and distinctive patterns of resistance, then a coordinated response could help substantially to control the spread of resistance. The literature to date provides only limited evidence on these issues.We study the pattern of antibiotic resistance in specific countries to gauge the range and depth of this global health threat. China and the U.S. stand out as good choices for study. Both are world economic powerhouses increasingly responding to the forces of economic globalization. In addition, both are major consumers of antibiotics, with the U.S. also being a leading source of new antibiotics. On the other hand, it would also be interesting to compare patterns of antibiotic resistance in smaller countries that stand relatively distant from these two. Accordingly, we compare the experiences of the U.S. and China with new data on the resistance experience of Kuwait.The first section gives brief background on antibiotic resistance and its costs. We then turn to a detailed comparison of surveillance data from China, Kuwait, and the U.S. We conclude with a plea for more research and attention on this critical issue for health and globalization.Background: The challenge of antimicrobial resistanceAccording to laws of Darwinian evolution, antimicrobial use creates a selection pressure on microorganisms: weak ones are killed, but stronger ones might adapt and survive. When pathogenic microorganisms can multiply beyond some critical mass in the face of invading antimicrobials, treatment outcome is compromised; this phenomenon is referred as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [3-9]. This paper focuses on antibiotic resistance, a major form of AMR.Background: The challenge of antimicrobial resistanceResistance mechanisms may develop over months or years [6]. Once established, a single resistance mechanism can often allow a bacterium to resist multiple drugs. It remains unclear whether resistance is reversible, and thus whether drug effectiveness is a renewable or non-renewable resource [10-15]. Drug resistance raises the cost of treatment for infectious diseases, sometimes manifold, as well as increasing morbidity and mortality from such diseases [16-23].Background: The challenge of antimicrobial resistanceThe greatest long-term threat of AMR is that resistant strains erode drug efficacy over time. The development of drug-resistant Staphylococci aureus (SAU) well illustrates the see-saw battle between pathogens and drugs. SAU is a bacterium that harmlessly lives in the human body but can cause infections on wounds or lesions. After the clinical application of penicillin in the 1940s, SAU soon adapted to the treatment mechanism of penicillin, and by the 1950s, almost half of SAU strains had become resistant to penicillin. A new antibiotic, methicillin, was developed in the 1960s. Yet by the late 1970s, methicillin-resistant SAU, i.e. MRSA, again became widespread. Today MRSA has become a major infectious culprit that can only be effectively treated with vancomycin, one of the few last killers of superbugs. Unfortunately, in 1996, a Japanese hospital reported the first case of vancomycin-resistant SAU (VRSA) during surgery on a four-month-old boy. The U.S., France and Hong Kong subsequently all reported VRSA incidents. A few years later in 2000, linezolid was launched as a new antibiotic to combat both MRSA and VRSA. But only one year later, Boston researchers reported the first case of linezolid-resistant MRSA in an 85-year-old man undergoing peritoneal dialysis. After failing to contain his MRSA by linezolid, researchers tried five antibiotics (ampicillin, azithromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin) but the unlucky man eventually died from the uncontrollable infection [24].Background: The challenge of antimicrobial resistanceResistant pathogens within a hospital or specific community can spread to a nation at large or across national boundaries. Thus, for example, rapidly increasing travel and migration within China probably contributes to the growth of that nation's resistance problem. It may also spur the spread of China's resistance problems overseas as globalization greatly increases travel from and to that nation (see Figure 1).MethodsWe collected data on drug resistance in China, the U.S. and Kuwait, drawing from published studies, reports from national surveillance systems, and previously unpublished data from a large hospital in Kuwait. Such data must be viewed with caution. Differences between countries arise not only from genuine differences in prevalence, but also from differences in sampling strategies, laboratory processing, and standards for defining a ""resistant"" strain. Moreover, within-country comparisons across time are biased by measurement error, particularly for small samples. However, analysis of the currently available data does yield some evidence and may help to raise awareness and efforts to improve the data and methods for addressing the problem.MethodsOur primary measure is the prevalence of resistance by a specific bacterium to a specific drug. The prevalence is calculated as the number of resistant isolates divided by the number of total isolates collected, multiplied by 100. We compute growth rates of resistance to specific bacteria using standard year-on-year growth calculations. Where appropriate, we smooth variance in small-sample data series by using three-year running averages.MethodsWe also develop methods to aggregate specific ""bug-drug"" data to summarize the resistance pattern for each country. These measures weight resistance rates by (1) the isolation frequency for each bacterium (that is, the proportion of a particular bacterium among all bacteria studied); and, where possible, by (2) the proportion of resistant cases hospital- versus community-acquired; and (3) the frequency with which each drug is used to treat infections caused by each bacterium. (For most calculations, measure (3) is not available.) Finally, we compare and contrast each country's resistance experience and, using the subset of data comparable across the three countries, examine correlations in patterns of resistance.MethodsThese methods represent preliminary steps to gauge whether patterns of antibiotic resistance converge over time amongst countries that currently have little population interchange. Future research would benefit from better surveillance of resistance, more comparable data reporting, data on antibiotic utilization, and further methodological advances in clinically- and policy-relevant aggregation of ""bug-drug"" data.China ::: ResultsIn 1988, the World Health Organization West Pacific Regional Office set up two antimicrobial resistance surveillance centers in Beijing and Shanghai. Meanwhile, China's Ministry of Health also established the China Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (CNIS) program, which monitors hospital-acquired infections. Unfortunately, most of the surveillance programs in China focus on urban hospitals. We lack data on urban communities and for the rural majority. Nevertheless, the available data allows us to piece together a picture of the extent of antimicrobial resistance in the most populous country in the world.China ::: ResultsTo examine AMR development in China, we use annual data from a seven-year (1994–2000) study by China's National Center for Antimicrobial Resistance, which reports resistance levels of ten most prevalent bacteria to a common antibiotic, ciprofloxacin (Table 1) [25]. With small sample sizes, the annual measured percentage of isolates found to be resistant varies considerably; to smooth the random variation attributable to small sample size, we use three-year running averages. Some bacteria such as ECO and MRSA have high proportions (60–80%) of resistant strains, whereas the prevalence of resistant strains for others such as PMI is quite low. Almost all but MSSA and PMI have shown considerable growth in resistance over the study period, resulting in an average annual growth rate of about 15%.China ::: ResultsAnother series of studies by the China Bacterial Resistance Surveillance Study Group focused on resistance prevalence among different patient types, i.e. those with hospital-acquired infections (HAI) versus community-acquired infections (CAI) [26,27]. We construct two measures to compare HAI and CAI resistance prevalence. First, by aggregating the seven bacteria, we get a measure γ indexed on the nineteen drugs. γ is calculated by multiplying the resistance rate of each bacterium by its isolation frequency and proportion among HAI (or CAI) infections, and then summing across bacteria. The measure is reported in the last two columns of Table 2 and graphed in Figure 2. Second, by aggregating the drugs, we obtain a measure indexed on bacteria. However, because we lack data on how often each drug is used, the best we can do is report the simple average for all drugs (implicitly assuming each drug is used with equal frequency). We name this measure Mean Resistance, shown in the last row in Table 2 and graphed in Figure 3.China ::: ResultsBoth measures reinforce the finding that infections acquired in a hospital are often more drug resistant than other (community-acquired) infections. For the seven bacteria, the mean resistance rate of HAI is on average 1.5 times that of CAI in China. For the nineteen drugs, the aggregate measure of resistance for HAI, γH, is on average 1.9 times that for CAI, γC. This pattern is most extreme for infections caused by SAU, where resistance of HAI is two- to three- times that of CAI, depending on which measure is used. (T-tests of the difference between two groups indicate a p-value of less than 0.01 for the γ's and less than 0.09 for the mean resistance). Moreover, the prevalence of drug resistance for both kinds of infections is quite high. Mean resistance of HAI is 41% and that of CAI is 28%.United States ::: ResultsFairly comprehensive data on resistance trends in the U.S. come from the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NNIS) for hospital-based resistance, and the U.S. Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABC) project, which surveys a population of 16 million to 25 million community residents in 9 states each year [28-30]. We use data from an ABC program that surveys Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from 1997 to 2002 to examine prevalence and trends (Table 3). The average growth rate of resistance for this bacterium was 8%, lower than the 15% number for China. Interestingly, unlike the upward resistance trend in China, SPN resistance declined in the last two years of the study period in the US, following an initial rise. Such data should not be interpreted to mean that actual prevalence is permanently declining, since measurement issues engender considerable year-to-year variation in the sample prevalence.United States ::: ResultsThe US NNIS program provides data for inpatients and outpatients. Further, among inpatients, the NNIS differentiates between those in and not in the ICU. For almost every bug-drug pair, resistance prevalence is highest among ICU patients, followed by non-ICU inpatients, with the lowest prevalence among outpatients (Table 4 and Figure 4). This pattern seems consistent with clinical reality, since patients in ICUs are more likely to have a weak immune system, either because of prolonged treatment or their own compromised conditions; moreover, many are catheterized, offering a conduit for bacteria.United States ::: ResultsCompared with China, the U.S. exhibits more moderate differences in resistance prevalence among different patients. The average prevalence of resistance for ICU, other inpatients, and outpatients in the U.S. are 20%, 17% and 13%, respectively; in China, average resistance for hospital-acquired infections is 41% and that for community-acquired infections is 28%.United States ::: ResultsPooling all patients together (Table 5), we find the prevalence of resistance and its growth to be 17% and 7% respectively, consistent with our previous observation that the U.S. seems to have both lower resistance prevalence and less dramatic increase in resistance than China does.Kuwait ::: ResultsThere is considerably less detailed data on antibiotic resistance for Kuwait than for China or the U.S. We gathered data on antimicrobial resistance among isolates of eight different bacterial diseases over the most recent five years. The data is based on surveillance from a single large teaching hospital, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital, which serves a catchment area representing about 60% of Kuwait's population. We report that data for the first time here and in a companion paper [31] (see Tables 6, 7, 8, 9).The average resistance level for all surveyed bacteria was about 27% from 1999 to 2003 (Table 10), higher than the 17% for the U.S. and about the same as the 28% China. As for the other two countries, resistance appears to be growing in Kuwait.Resistance correlations ::: Discussion: Comparing antibiotic resistance in China, the U.S. and KuwaitHow similar or different are resistance patterns in different countries? Does transmission travel across national borders as humans do? If so, do countries' resistance patterns converge? To begin to examine this issue, we construct coefficients of resistance correlation among China, U.S. and Kuwait. We rank resistance rates for 24 bug-drug pairs and define perfect correlation as each bug-drug pair displaying the same resistance rank. Perfect negative correlation exists if the ranks in two countries go in precisely the opposite order. Table 13 reports the correlation coefficient for each pair of countries. The statistic by definition is bounded between -1 and 1, where -1 means perfect disagreement while 1 means perfect agreement. Thus the bigger the statistic, the more correlated two countries' resistance patterns are.Resistance correlations ::: Discussion: Comparing antibiotic resistance in China, the U.S. and KuwaitOf course, methods for aggregation and comparing patterns of resistance across countries and over time should be improved, and applied more fruitfully with better data from increased local and global surveillance. But even this preliminary analysis reveals some interesting patterns. For example, resistance rates in China are much more strongly correlated with those in Kuwait than those in the U.S. This correlation pattern suggests that at least in the short run, resistance in a country is more likely to be determined by endogenous factors (such as strictness of practices for prescribing drugs). In the long run, the frequency and magnitude of contacts among nations with different resistance problems is likely to be critical. Because Kuwait and China are relatively isolated countries, it is less surprising that their antibiotic resistance problems show domestic characters. However, as we expect them to be opening more to the world, particularly China, the problem may worsen when these countries can increasingly export and import antibiotic resistance. China, the most populous country in the world and an economy with the highest growth, is particularly likely to exacerbate the problem. As illustrated in Figure 1, the number of Chinese departures to overseas destinations has been growing at increasing rates in the past decade and continues to show upward momentum in recent years.Resistance correlations ::: Discussion: Comparing antibiotic resistance in China, the U.S. and KuwaitNo doubt, there are also complex interactions with levels of economic well- being. Drugs become more affordable as countries become richer, but they are likely to be given out more carefully, particularly since concerns about resistance also increase. The critical question for policy is whether countries can control their own resistance problems, and also avoid importing the problem from abroad.ConclusionWe have outlined the nature of the antimicrobial resistance problem as an important health and cost issue for three quite disparate nations, and by inference for a broad swath of the world's population. Surprisingly, this issue virtually never receives prominent attention at the national or international level, despite its scope and potentially devastating impact on global public health in the coming decades.ConclusionWe examined antimicrobial resistance data for China, Kuwait, and the United States. In each country, we looked at specific infectious agents and their resistance to particular antibiotics or other antimicrobials. Though an upward trend of resistance is found broadly, the patterns of correlation between countries' resistance rates suggest predominantly independent profiles. But we would expect greater convergence as globalization increases contacts between different nations' populations, raising questions about how to coordinate an effective international response [35].ConclusionFuture research should develop better methods of data aggregation, explore the patterns of drug resistance across more countries, analyze the determinants of transmission of drug resistance across national boundaries, and assess how those determinants are progressing. Individuals everywhere would benefit if far greater attention were paid to the problem of antimicrobial resistance.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsRFZ assembled the data, carried out the analysis and drafted the manuscript.

The basic principles of migration health: Population mobility and gaps in disease prevalence,"The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionSome diseases or illnesses are sustained by differences that are purely geographic or environmental in origin. In other situations, differences in health outcomes, and the factors that determine or influence health outcomes, result from more complex interactions. The environment [26], socio-economics, genetics and biology, and behavioural factors influence population measurements of disease prevalence individually and in combination.The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionExamples of environmentally-limited diseases include vector-borne conditions, for which environmental factors determine the distribution of disease transmission, as observed in the global epidemiology of malaria, Chagas' disease, yellow fever and West Nile Virus. Environmentally-related non-communicable disease epidemiological disparities include micronutrient deficiencies [27] and geographically-defined exposure risks, such as health outcomes related to extreme weather or altitude [28]. Movement of the population out of the risk environment (i.e. African refugees in Europe and North America and malaria) or establishment of disease transmission outside of the usual environmental constraints (i.e. West Nile Virus in North America) will impact on the epidemiology of the condition in the receiving region and on the local population health outcomes.The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionSocial and economic influences can be significant factors in the creation and maintenance of differences in health and disease outcomes between populations. Poverty, education, housing and nutrition are directly related to disease prevalence and illness outcomes [29]. The capacities and capabilities of medical and health sectors can affect health through the availability, accessibility [30] and affordability of health promotion, disease prevention and treatment services [31,32]. Additional factors that influence health risks and outcomes include language skills [33], behavioural and cultural practices [34,35], such as the use of tobacco, dietary practices and population norms for body mass and physical exercise [36].The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionMigrants and other mobile populations reflect the health characteristics of their place and environment of origin and carry several of these characteristics with them when they move [37,38]. In addition, migrants are also subject to other specific influences that may affect their health. These factors result from the process of migration itself, for example, during the travel phase between origin and destination. This is frequently observed in refugees, displaced persons and disadvantaged migrant populations such as trafficked or smuggled persons [39-41], and includes events such as trauma and torture [42,43]. Other migration-specific health influences are observed in migrant worker populations [44,45], the children of migrants [46] and returning travellers who have been visiting family and friends [47]. A demographic and mobility process approach to these considerations is presented in table 2.The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionThe impact of genetic and biological determinants of health and disease may be intuitively self-evident. However, in non-endemic regions these influences, and their linkages to population mobility, may be poorly appreciated in the early phases of migration due to lack of awareness, knowledge or experience in the healthcare delivery sector [48].The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionDisparities in health determinants and disease outcomes are not absolute, but change over time. This temporal variability adds an important dimension of complexity to the analysis and investigation of migrant health concerns, which can affect cohort comparability. Economic and social environments can change rapidly in the modern world. If those changes influence health determinants, consequential changes in health outcomes can be observed over relatively short periods of time. For example, in the thirty years following 1965, the difference between life expectancy for males in the United Kingdom and Russia increased by more than ten years (range from 3.6 to 15.1 years) [49]. Basic public health improvements such as the provision of adequate, safe drinking water, improved sewerage and housing can significantly reduce the incidence and prevalence of diseases of major public health importance in the space of less than a generation [50]. Similarly, conflict, environmental change, natural disasters and population growth can result in new risk exposures and acquisition of adverse health outcomes over short time periods [51]. Genetic admixture and behavioural characteristics of individuals and populations that impact on health outcomes can also occur singly and in combination with other determinants vary over time.The dynamics of health disparities ::: IntroductionThese rapid temporal changes influence the epidemiology of health disparities. If they take place against a background of sustained or growing migration, they may also influence the interpretation of longitudinal and comparative studies involving migrants. Health outcomes for current departing migrants may differ significantly from previous cohorts originating at the same location, as health indicators change over time at the migrants' place of origin. Depending on the nature of the local changes, either improved or worsening health characteristics in current migrant cohorts may be observed. Examples of this ''time phase'' phenomenon can be seen in the improved population health indicators of several Asian nations that have occurred following recent trends in large-scale migration from Asia to Europe and North America. Some of these changes are significant, as indicated by the changing mortality data due to hypertensive cardiac disease in Korea. During the interval between 1984 and 1999, the age-adjusted mortality for hypertensive cardiac disease in Korean men decreased by 92% (from 51.6 to 4.1/100,000) and 84% for women (from 34.1 to 5.3/100,000) [52]. By contrast, examples of diminishing levels of good health indicators can be observed in some Central and Eastern European nations in the period following the dissolution of the Soviet Union [53].Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionWhile migration has always been a fluid process subject to change, these changes must now be assessed in terms of the rate of change and global magnitude of population movement. During the past 50 years, the process of migration and concomitant movement of other mobile populations has been markedly influenced by:Modern migration and population mobility ::: Introduction1. The decolonialisation of many nations, including those in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean;Modern migration and population mobility ::: Introduction2. Large refugee movements following conflicts and civil disturbances, including South East Asia, the Balkans, Central America and Central Africa; andModern migration and population mobility ::: Introduction3. The political, social and economic consequences of the collapse of the former Soviet Union.Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionAs a result of these events, between 1960 and 2000 the legal and administrative restrictions on the ability to travel, work and move internationally have changed for hundreds of millions of individuals. This has been associated with a profound shift in the demography of people on the move and the nature of migration itself [54]. In traditional migrant-receiving regions such as Australia and North America, patterns of migrant origin have shifted from Europe to source countries in Asia, Africa, Central and South America and the Middle East [55] in the timespan of little more than one generation.Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionThis evolution has not been limited to regulated, traditional immigration and emigration. It has also involved refugee and humanitarian movements and an increase in irregular arrivals (refugee claimants, asylum seeking, smuggling and trafficking in humans). Complex humanitarian emergencies are often associated with large population displacements of refugees, humanitarian evacuees and other displaced populations. Unlike refugee movements before the Second World War that were often passive, modern international attention and efforts are frequently directed at assisting the international relocation of vulnerable migrant populations. International organisations such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees [56] and the International Organization for Migration [57], as well as other infrastructures, now support and facilitate the selection, movement and resettlement of these populations. These activities are now global in scope and planning, involve an increasing number of nations and, when triggered, take place more rapidly than historical refugee resettlements [58].Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionAgainst this backdrop of political, social and civil societal change, the nature, speed and access to international travel has also undergone marked evolution. Travel patterns have been affected by changes in transportation technology, accessibility, and affordability. Growth in air travel has functionally reduced previous limits on the rapid international movement of large numbers of individuals. In 1960, there were approximately 70 million international journeys globally. The number of similar international journeys in 2004 was in excess of 760 million [59]. The high volume of international travel supports greater population exchange and return flows between migrant origin and destination locations.Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionIncreased international travel has also been an integral component of the growing process of globalisation. The progressive integration of global economic and communications sectors has been accompanied, if not preceded by, a corresponding growth in the international demand and flow of labour and manpower. The International Labour Organization estimates the foreign-born migrant labour force to be nearly 90 million persons worldwide [60]. In several locations, there is a repetitive flow of workers between regions of origin and regions of employment. Some of these movements are regular and organised. However, modern population pressures and economic push-pull factors related to marked global differences in opportunity are increasingly associated with irregular population flows facilitated by either smuggling or trafficking of those seeking a better life [61].Modern migration and population mobility ::: IntroductionAnother recent series of factors affecting population mobility and migration has resulted from geo-political changes such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union [62]. The resulting economic, social and political consequences have both direct and indirect impacts on the demography and movement patterns of migrants to Western Europe, parts of Middle-East Asia and the Americas [63]. Current immigration, family reunification and return dynamics in Europe and Central Asia are profoundly different from those of only two decades previously. These changes have been manifested in both voluntary migration, such as that observed in migrants from the former Soviet Union to Israel [64], as well as the flow of refugees and those displaced by regional conflict, as exemplified in the Balkans in the mid to late 1990s [65].The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionIn much of the developed world, infections that were historically significant causes of illness and death have decreased in incidence and prevalence or been eliminated. This was accomplished through sanitation, immunisation, antibiotic therapy, and improved healthcare and public health practices. By the end of the last millennium, several globally important infections had reached the point where they were no longer of public health significance in economically advantaged areas of the world. In some areas of the developed world, domestic transmission of serious infectious diseases, such as measles [66] and polio [67], has been eliminated. This is far in advance of what was observed or possible in the developing world. This can create enormous differences in the prevalence of certain conditions between locations. In a mobile world, travellers and migrants crossing these prevalence gaps can become the source for outbreaks of these diseases [68].The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionThe creation of such prevalence differences is not limited to communicable diseases. The ability to treat and manage non-infectious diseases in highly developed regions of the world likewise differs from the situation in many developing regions. Access to and use of complex and costly interventions, such as cancer treatment, organ system support, transplantation and extensive pharmacotherapy vary according to levels of national economic development. These disparities in social investments in health services availability and population access to healthcare are associated with several differential inter-regional health outcomes, including premature death and increased morbidity in the developing world [69].The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionIn the absence of extensive international travel, population mobility and migration, the effects of differences in disease prevalence would have limited global significance. Nations and regions would strive to improve their domestic health capacities and reduce the domestic burden of disease and illness within their population much as they have done throughout history. However, expanding travel and migration across these prevalence differentials now function as an increasing, population-based bridge between the disparities. The net result is the global extension of what was predominantly a local risk.The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionThe global extension of regional epidemiological differences can have marked impact on the local epidemiology of disease. Examples include tuberculosis, sexually-acquired infections, Chagas' disease and strongyloidiasis, for which foreign-born migrants from hyper-endemic areas represent the majority of national case burden in low incidence or non-endemic nations [70-73]. Similar patterns of epidemiological evolution exist for other long-term infections such as hepatitis B and C, as well as HIV/AIDS in some European nations, where these diseases are reported to be more common in foreign-born migrants than in native-born residents [74-76].The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionMigration-related epidemiological influences on domestic disease patterns for migrant-receiving nations are also observed for non-infectious diseases [77]. Migrants arriving from less developed regions of the world may have had less access to preventive care, health promotion programmes, and diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for illness and disease. Cancer detection programs [78] and periodic health examinations may not be commonly accessible in many populations. Access to healthcare providers and basic services are unequally distributed or subject to limited availability in many places. Similar differences in availability can be observed for smoking and substance abuse prevention programmes, programmes to detect and manage vitamin or micronutrient deficiencies, promotion of dental health and programmes to manage genetic or biological conditions [79]. As a consequence, migrants may present with disease in more advanced stages than normally observed by providers in the destination country [80].The epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence ::: IntroductionIn considering migration in a population health context, it is important to note that not all of the migration-associated epidemiological changes relate to situations where the migrants are less advantaged than the host population. In terms of lifestyle-related non-infectious illnesses, many migrants and new arrivals display health parameters that are better than those of the receiving population [81]. Over time and resulting from a variety of factors including acculturation, diet and behavioural changes, immigrant populations may acquire and display common adverse health indicators more similar to those of the receiving population [82]. Ironically, some of the beneficial factors arriving with immigrants may be adapted locally to the general benefit of the host population, but may be lost over time in immigrant population and their locally-born children.Temporal effects of migration on local health and disease epidemiology ::: IntroductionMigration-associated influences on the epidemiology of disease have both immediate and long-term effects on host country health indicators due to differentials in disease prevalence, as well as magnitude factors associated with population census shifts (because of the number of migrants and births to the foreign-born cohort). For diseases of rare or limited occurrence, particularly where national incidence has been reduced to very low levels, the presentation of even a single case can have important implications locally and internationally [83]. This can result in a heightened perception of threat to the public health of the local population and increase concerns regarding capacity and response of healthcare service delivery. Recent examples of this include the global public health control efforts resulting from the 2003 SARS events [84,85], avian-to-human influenza transmission [86,87], periodic outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers [88] and the impact of HIV/AIDS cases in Europe and North America [89,90] acquired abroad.Temporal effects of migration on local health and disease epidemiology ::: IntroductionThe continued arrival of new residents from high prevalence areas will contribute to the existing disease base of low incidence migrant-receiving locations. Over time, as observed with regard to globally prevalent but non-uniformly distributed diseases such as tuberculosis [91], imported cases among migrants and other mobile populations can come to represent the majority of the case load in the recipient nation. In these situations, where domestic epidemiology comes to reflect global disease distribution through the process of migration, health policy implications become apparent. Long-term healthcare policy and planning in migrant-receiving nations will have to encompass an international and more global focus to be effective. Reliance on historical, domestic epidemiology for policy implementation in these nations will have limited relevance when disease volumes and case-burdens originate beyond the mandate and jurisdiction of national prevention and control efforts [92]. For example, hepatitis A infection associated with population mobility in some western nations has raised concerns for the need of national domestic immunisation programs to deal with what is, in fact, the international persistence of the disease [93].Temporal effects of migration on local health and disease epidemiology ::: IntroductionIn terms of non-infectious diseases, migration-associated pressures result from the need to provide service delivery in culturally or linguistically sensitive programmes for the prevention or treatment of illness in migrant communities. While uncomplicated in principle, the provision of health promotion or prevention advice, such as that recently recommended for asthma and atopy in migrant populations [94], can be both a logistical and resource challenge [95].Temporal effects of migration on local health and disease epidemiology ::: IntroductionThe reintroduction of diseases into low incidence locations through migration coupled with the growth of new populations with wide linguistic and cultural diversity can create difficulties in recognition, diagnosis and treatment [96]. In some situations, delayed treatment can have important consequences. These consequences may directly affect the patient [97], influence demands on programs and, for some contagious conditions, challenge the public health management of the exposed population. The growth and ease of travel, in conjunction with the increased numbers of those who are mobile, continues to raise the likelihood of the global extension and presentation of many diseases and illnesses. Maintaining sufficient degrees of clinical suspicion as well as laboratory diagnostic expertise, capacity and access can be costly and complicated. Growing needs for cultural and linguistic competencies in the health sector increases this complexity [98]. Such preparedness requires the education, training and maintenance of competence of healthcare providers and the associated infrastructures for diagnosis and care [99] (see table 3).Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionNegative health outcomes resulting from migration and population mobility can be expected to increasingly exert major influences on both national and global health planning. Mobility is a basic and fundamental component of the rapidly expanding globalisation process. Analysis suggests that the volume of immigration, travel and the migration of labour are expected to remain at current levels or increase for the foreseeable future. At the same time, current regional and global health disparities are anticipated to remain or increase, despite the international desire and efforts to reduce them. Global efforts aimed at reducing global disparities and impacts of disease and ill health, such as attempts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals [100], are currently underway. These are long-term initiatives that will take time, resources and extensive effort to achieve and maintain. The longer inter-regional disparities in health and health outcomes persist, the longer they will continue to influence the health of migrants, as well as mobile and non-mobile populations, and the greater the challenge and cost will be to effect control of these conditions.Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionHistorically, the majority of the health issues associated with migration, or occurring as a result of migration, have been managed at the national level. This has been accomplished through either immigration health activities or exclusion, or as a component of other domestic health programs. Demand for these services will remain in some locations due to specific situational issues or particular migratory movements. Nationally mandated immigration health screening [101] and the management of health issues associated with the Hajj [102] are two examples of those situations. In other areas, the evolution of travel and migration has reduced the effectiveness of many national, point-of-arrival activities. New patterns of population mobility require reconsideration of the practicality and viability of border-health inspection for exclusion or containment strategies. Some nations with large immigration medical programs maintain specific screening or intervention programs for targeted diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis and HIV/AIDS. Accumulating evidence suggests that more effective outcomes could be obtained through interventions focused on disease control efforts in source nations rather than reliance on arrival screening alone [103]. The globalisation of risks – manifest by the mobility of large numbers of individuals flowing across and between disparities in health environments and disease prevalence – will require increased investment in globally-focused resources and management commitments, as opposed to inward-looking national management strategies and programs.Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionThe increased recognition of the importance of these issues has already resulted in reconsideration of international policy and program activity [104]. Global response initiatives have been designed, and in some cases implemented, primarily as a result of concerns regarding the potential adverse population health outcomes posed by certain infectious disease threats. International collaboration is underway to track and monitor disease in the global context. Some of these activities are represented by the internationalisation of epidemiological surveillance, reporting and response reflected in the recent revisions to the International Health Regulations [105].Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionIt is evident that health program and policy planning processes need to anticipate and manage the future impacts of population mobility [106]. In several western nations, migrants and other mobile populations represent sizeable and growing population sectors. Over time, the specific health needs and characteristics of these mobile population cohorts will exert greater influence on the health sector in the receiving host nations [107]. The influence of genetic and biological factors in health and disease will increase in parallel with the size of diverse migrant populations. At the same time, the impact and influence of the health environment and epidemiology of disease at the migrants' place of origin will continue to be reflected in both migrants and the children of migrant parents [108] long after the period of immigration.Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionAddressing these challenges at the national level will require some changes in the epidemiological context that is applied to prospective policy development and programme management (see table 4). In a globalised world in which travel and migration represent the experience of a large and growing population cohort, they can be expected to assume a standard role as a determination factor influencing many health outcomes [109]. In a manner similar to age, sex, genetics, biology, behaviour, and educational and wealth attainment, the mobility history at both the individual and population levels will need to become a routine consideration in healthcare policy, planning, education, training and service delivery [110].Future impact of population mobility on global health ::: IntroductionSimilar population-based approaches are already in use in some of the national and international infectious disease surveillance and monitoring systems described above [111]. The analysis and interpretation of the information collected by those systems has demonstrated the importance of migration-related travel in terms of imported tropical infections [112]. The extension of the collection of the travel and mobility history to non-infectious disease surveillance is both logical and supported by preliminary study.Summary ::: IntroductionAt the national and international level, the epidemiological outcomes and issues related to migration can be seen to result from the predictable effects of population flows between and across regional disparities and disease prevalence differentials. The growing number of migrants of diverse nature is bridging existing and developing gaps in health outcome indicators. The dynamics of migration and population mobility are evolving at a rate that creates health challenges for existing policy and programme frameworks that differ from those observed in historic migratory movements [113].Summary ::: IntroductionThe net result is an ongoing globalisation of health influences and indicators currently relevant at both national and global level. The epidemiological impact of population mobility is now evident in a considerable amount of infectious disease surveillance information [114] and similar impacts can be anticipated for non-infectious illnesses in immigration receiving nations [115].Summary ::: IntroductionAs long as global health disparities and prevalence differentials exist, national health programs and policies in migrant receiving nations will continue to be challenged by illness and disease arising beyond their jurisdiction. National control and regulatory systems alone will be unable to extend their immediate mandate or authority to the source of the problem. To be effective, the management of health issues resulting from population mobility will require an integration of national and global health initiatives for both infectious [116] and non-infectious [117] disease conditions."
Clinical review: SARS – lessons in disaster management,"The Commission recognizes the skill and dedication of so many individuals in the Ontario public health system and those volunteers from Ontario and elsewhere who worked beyond the call of duty ... They faced enormous workloads and pressures in their tireless fight, in a rapidly changing environment, against a deadly mysterious disease. The strength of Ontario's response lay in the work of the people who stepped up and fought SARS. What went right in a system where so much went wrong, is their dedication ... [1]IntroductionDisaster management plans have traditionally been required to manage major traumatic events that create a large number of victims. Infectious diseases, whether they be natural or the result of bioterrorism, have the potential to create a large influx of critically ill patients, and disaster management planning should take such eventualities into account. This need was demonstrated in February 2003, when a new illness – SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) – spread from the People's Republic of China to 28 countries, resulting in 8096 probable cases with 774 deaths [2]. This review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in a disaster outbreak situation. By sharing our experiences and our coping strategies, we hope that others will learn from our successes and avoid the problems we encountered, many of which were a direct result of lack of preparedness. We hope that this review will encourage others to make plans to cope with similar outbreaks in the future, should they occur.IntroductionThe diagnosis of SARS relies on a high index of clinical suspicion because there is no early, reliable and readily available diagnostic test for the responsible virus (SARS-CoV) [3-6]. Likewise, it is expected that other emerging infectious agents will pose diagnostic challenges. Because of this, as infected individuals present to medical institutions where staff are unprepared, the risk for spread is considerable. An outbreak situation may arise quickly and without much warning, taxing the resources of any health care system and the ability of its personnel to cope. The most fundamental guidance we offer is that you need to have a plan in advance. Since 11 September 2001, the USA and other countries have run exercises to prepare for attacks, including bioterrorism [7-12]. We believe that, based on the way in which SARS crippled our health care system (in particular critical care delivery) and dealt significant blows to our economy, a great deal could be gained from simulating similar events and planning a system wide response to emerging pathogens.IntroductionThe development of a disaster management plan in the event of emerging diseases poses very unique challenges, and we offer some insights into these below.Infection control ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesAny jurisdiction dealing with an outbreak of a new infectious disease must ensure that it has the means to communicate clearly and quickly, as well as receive information, on the following: updated diagnostic criteria; suspected and established epidemiological links; numbers of infected patients as well as those quarantined and at risk; prognosis and treatment issues; current knowledge regarding the most effective means of infection control; and infection control issues specific to different settings [1,13].Infection control ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesAny disaster plan must anticipate needs for infection control equipment [11,14]. The SARS outbreak and the ongoing risk for other emerging infections emphasize the importance of having some basic stock [14], and creating a list of potential suppliers who could rapidly increase their supply is advisable. Requirements may be enormous; one Toronto hospital used 18,000 N95 masks and 14,000 pairs of gloves daily during the SARS outbreak [15].Infection control ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesThe importance of infection control measures, and of the development of clear protocols and training cannot be overemphasized [14]. In Toronto one of the greatest challenges that arose was handling the uncertainty of exactly what level of precautions were needed to ensure staff safety. This was an issue that had to be addressed immediately because getting appropriate staff to work required that they felt as protected as possible. Anecdotally, we found in some centres that distrust occasionally emerged between front-line health care workers and leadership. This may have been due to several issues, including the following: there was no clear system-wide communication strategy, and as a result rumours and speculation frequently went unchecked; infection control and other recommendations changed frequently, leading many individuals to question the validity of previous directives; and confusion over whether the responsible virus could be airborne and variable use of airborne versus droplet protection. Of note, subsequent evidence suggests that airborne transmission may in fact be possible [16]. In retrospect, we believe a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy (which occurred in some institutions) that acknowledged the fact that leadership was making decisions in the face of uncertainty would have minimized the distrust.Surveillance ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesUnlike traditional notions of disaster (e.g. bombings), disaster situations from infectious disease outbreaks do not have a clear beginning or end. Disaster planning for these circumstances is unique in that it challenges us to develop practical means to conduct ongoing, widespread surveillance and screening [1,11,13], particularly in light of unclear prodromes and illness presentations and in the absence of diagnostic testing. There is a need to develop a team to track and follow potential epidemiological linkages quickly and to engage in surveillance for de novo cases. This team will potentially have to collaborate across wide geographical regions, engage in open discussion of uncertainty, and develop a surveillance and quarantine strategy that is practical, as comprehensive as possible and does not needlessly isolate individuals and restrict their freedoms. In the face of uncertain diagnostic criteria, it is important to acknowledge that some individuals will be isolated needlessly and some infected asymptomatic individuals will be missed, leading to new cases with the potential to perpetuate the outbreak. It is important that the surveillance team does not seek to assign blame under these circumstances; instead, an analysis of each 'failed' surveillance or error should be undertaken to improve overall knowledge of disease transmission and presentation, and to prevent other infected individuals from falling through the cracks. From the critical care point of view, it is important that there is a feedback loop from these surveillance teams to the critical care leadership, so that that subsequent reliable communication and preparation can be assured.Front-line workers ::: Communication issues ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesAny information regarding the transmission of disease to staff, an analysis of how such spread may have occurred and advice regarding future preventative measures should be made available to everyone. In the present era of global travel, it is increasingly unlikely that one centre or one country will be dealing with new emerging diseases in isolation. Disaster planners are challenged to develop a global perspective, including accurate communication of events as they unfold in distant jurisdictions. As a result, links to colleagues locally, nationally and internationally are vital in a disaster situation.Front-line workers ::: Communication issues ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesWebsites providing the most up-to-date information regarding the outbreak, modes of transmission, clinical presentation and required infection control measures can ensure speedy communication to large numbers of people. In addition, such websites can be used to teach how to don protective gear, discuss and outline treatment strategies, teach how to respond to unique crisis situations (e.g. cardiac arrests while maintaining infection control measures), and serve as a way to train treatment teams at different hospital sites. Indeed, internet-based technology proved invaluable during the SARS outbreak in Toronto by allowing our experiences and our newly, on occasion painfully, gained knowledge to be shared with other affected centres and countries. Colleagues in unaffected countries were warned and prepared (for example, see SARS resources [17]). The establishment of such systems for communicating and sharing information, resources, data and research endeavours is one of the clear successes in the management of SARS. Efforts to establish such links should be made in all future outbreak situations [18].Patients and families ::: Communication issues ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesThose affected by SARS were scared. We were unable to provide them with much information; they were isolated and prognosis was very uncertain. Affected patients must be kept as informed as possible. Family members who had had any contact with the patient were placed in strict quarantine, and as a result they were not allowed to visit, even if a loved one was dying. Any disaster management plan must anticipate the isolation and need for informational, psychological and emotional support for those immediately affected, including loved ones. The Toronto experience suggests that there is a need to develop more effective means to convey information on quarantine and infection control and to provide support [19].Media and public ::: Communication issues ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesIn Toronto, the SARS outbreak received unprecedented media attention. Daily headlines generated widespread fear and panic. Efforts to decrease sensationalism, to portray an honest picture, and to elicit the help and understanding of the public were lessons that can be learned for any disaster management plan [20,21]. Assigning one team of professionals, as outlined in Fig. 1, to inform and update the media would ensure that consistent information is provided, and would avoid the confusion, fear, anxiety and even chaos that can potentially arise (frequently resulting from inaccurate information) if left unchecked.Education ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesEducating teams on how to treat infected individuals, mount surveillance for others, observe infection control measures, respond to emergency situations, collect data and conduct research, and support each other is vital. The education team would be responsible for the creation of educational packages that could be disseminated across many institutions. In addition, mobile educational teams can be deployed to individual institutions to meet specific needs. By developing and ensuring consistent standards of infection control across institutions, these teams not only will help to decrease the transmission of disease and avoid prolongation of the outbreak, but also will serve to support staff morale by helping them to develop means to overcome any environmental barriers to infection control, sharing experiences and emphasizing the fact that everyone faces similar challenges and is working together.Education ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesWhen the outbreak is controlled, educational efforts are not over. The team responsible for education must also be prepared to analyze its performance and devise ways to improve. In addition, ongoing training exercises, potentially using simulators and mock outbreak/disaster exercises, must be instituted to ensure that knowledge gained is not lost and that front-line workers are prepared for the next time, because this next time may arise with little or no warning. Finally, the SARS outbreak also helped us to identify another educational need by our intensive care unit (ICU) fellowship trainees – the need to provide them with practical hands-on experience in leadership.Team morale/manpower ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesDuring the SARS outbreak health care providers felt isolated [22,23]. Many front-line workers curtailed interactions with their families and friends for fear of transmitting the disease [22]. Others were treated as pariahs. Front-line workers were required to manage a level of critical illness that they might not usually have managed [23,24]. Infection control measures were burdensome and difficult to bear. Despair and depression became common [23,24].Team morale/manpower ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesRegular communication via teleconferences and e-mails became the new means to provide support. These provided a forum to dispel rumours, clarify media reports, synthesize the barrage of government directives, and support those feeling isolated as we sought to work in extremely difficult and demanding conditions, such as seeing our colleagues placed in quarantine after exposure, some of them falling ill, becoming critically ill and even succumbing to SARS.Team morale/manpower ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesStaff morale was addressed in some institutions by encouraging and commending health care workers, and congratulating them, whether for their efforts to treat patients, collect data, communicate with other centres and share information, improve infection control measures or teach others, or for simply surviving the day and/or night. Some hospitals instituted regular group support meetings and debriefing with the help of psychiatric or emergency response crisis teams.Team morale/manpower ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesThe most effective way to provide support is not currently known. Particular attention to devising ways to decrease isolation and the emotional and psychological burdens should be an integral part of any disaster management plan. During an outbreak, providing support does not necessarily require a complicated plan. Providing meals or refreshments to staff working in cumbersome, hot and heavy protective gear, and providing safe areas to relax in are simple, easy and well appreciated means to convey support. The presence of leaders who are prepared to risk their own health alongside front-line staff, who listen to staff concerns and address them to the best of their ability, and who discuss and/or reiterate management plans is another straightforward means to provide much needed support and a boost to staff morale. It is important that leadership demonstrate willingness to participate in the front-line environment. Finally, consideration of the need for management of post-traumatic stress disorder, in consultation with psychiatric colleagues, is prudent, and such investment is likely to prevent some of the long-term disability we have seen.Team morale/manpower ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesAny future similar situations will also pose challenges to professionalism. As seen with SARS [22] and the emergence of HIV [25-27], most health care providers never anticipated being in a situation that put their personal safety, health and potentially their lives and those of their families on the line. Questions arose regarding whether there is a duty to care and how much personal risk should be expected [22]. Some refused to care for SARS patients, and some refused to even enter wards containing SARS patients [22]. Others demanded 'danger pay' and compensation for illness and quarantine. Understandably, some worried about the extent of their disability and life insurance coverage. These views raised further challenges, fracturing the front-line teams who found themselves asking what, if anything, made their colleagues' lives more 'valuable' than their own. Issues of duty to care and of balancing personal risk and professional obligations remain for a large part unanswered. Further research and debate is required. Disaster planning must, however, consider whether such issues are likely to arise and include potential strategies to deal with them. Consideration should be given to developing means to decrease the anxiety regarding transmission of illness to family members; these could include child care and arranging the provision of alternate living quarters for staff, among others.Intensive care unit resource management: manpower and beds ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesDuring the SARS outbreak, the supply of critical care beds became a significant concern because of the need to manage a surge of unanticipated critically ill patients. This was a big problem because our occupancy rates were already unacceptably high. This supply issue will become a crucial concern in any future outbreak or disaster situation. In addition to our problem with bed availability, the human resources component further exacerbated the problem; the staff numbers were reduced by fear of contracting the disease, quarantine and illness. When SARS transmission occurred in ICUs, entire units were quarantined for 12–14 days. Of tertiary care university medical/surgical ICU beds and community ICU beds in Toronto, 38% and 33%, respectively, were closed at some point [28]. Maintaining provision of ICU services to non-SARS patients became an important consideration as the outbreak progressed. In anticipation of future outbreaks, plans to organize critical care resources to meet the needs of all critically ill patients should be developed. For example, critical care beds can be rapidly augmented by other areas of the hospital that are adequately equipped (e.g. recovery rooms, operating rooms, emergency rooms, etc.).Intensive care unit resource management: manpower and beds ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesInstitutions do need to develop their own individual plans based on their available resources, and must share the models/strategies that they institute so that others can learn and potentially adapt these plans to their own centres. However, one of the most important roles played by the Central Critical Care Crisis Team is to help create more ICU resources, rapidly. The scope of future outbreaks or disasters will always be uncertain, but, potentially, critical care providers will need to be able to care for many, many more patients very quickly. Because most ICUs currently function at very high occupancy rates, absorbing such additional numbers is unimaginable. Meeting these needs clearly requires us to move from institution-based to system-based thinking. In addition, critical care providers must be prepared to make tough decisions regarding triage and standards of care. Critical care providers should pre-develop engineering plans to isolate wards, rather than those that were developed by necessity on-the-fly in Toronto.From silos to system-based thinking ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesThe creation of such a system-based disaster management plan is not an easy task. Sharing information and learning from collective experience requires unprecedented collaboration and open communication between all levels of government, health care organizations and front-line workers. There is no room for political barriers, institution-based thinking (as opposed to system-wide thinking), bickering over responsibilities, or consideration of personal professional gain [1,13]. System-wide thinking may challenge even the most seasoned of critical care providers because the scope of current barriers, the number of people involved and the effort needed to get them to collaborate on such a broad scale is not something that they will necessarily have experienced or tried to tackle in the past.From silos to system-based thinking ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesThese systems versus institutional issues are common in any health care system; in Toronto they worsened the impact of SARS, and in the early days of the outbreak they diminished much needed communication and collaboration [1,13]. We also observed that in many hospitals there was duplication of some efforts, wasting precious resources [1,13] at a time when, after many years of cutbacks and strain, we did not have resources to waste. Events such as SARS challenge all of us to review the organizational structure of our health care systems and correct potential problems that may arise in similar situations [1,13]. Consideration should be given to designating specific hospitals as main centres for screening suspected cases and treating those affected; identifying hospitals to meet general and those to meet more specialized care needs of other critically ill patients; devising means to increase critical care resources within the affected region; and identifying institutions to decant certain patients to (e.g. alternate level of care patients) and to provide for specific ongoing needs of the population (e.g. cardiac services).From silos to system-based thinking ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesAlthough the designation of outbreak hospitals does place a greater toll on front-line workers in these institutions, those health care providers caring for greater numbers of SARS patients in Toronto actually experienced less anxiety in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology [29]. Such measures may also result in faster disease containment (by decreasing breaches in infection control) and better patient care as the teams become more familiar with the disease. Unlike the Toronto experience, in which SARS hospitals were designated late in the outbreak, SARS hospitals in other countries experienced little to no transmission to staff [30]. In Toronto, entire ICUs were quarantined as a result of transmission of SARS to staff [28]. Subsequently, provision of critical care to both SARS patients and all other critically ill patients was jeopardized. Although designation of outbreak hospitals seems a simple solution, it is not as easy as it appears. For example, finding staff willing to work in such a setting is a challenge. In addition, such a plan does not preclude other hospitals from knowing how to deal with the illness because, for the most part, the diagnosis is not clear for several days and originating hospitals will need to be prepared to manage patients until that point. Furthermore, designated hospitals will need access to other medical services as affected individuals develop other complications. Finally, the act of transporting such contagious individuals is not without considerable risk, and hence transportation requires careful planning. We recommend that regions develop and, importantly, test plans for working as a system during a disaster like this.Lobbying ::: Disaster plan development: leadership and organizational issuesIntensivists played a vital role during the SARS outbreak. The ICU saw the greatest mortality and had to deal with high-risk situations that increased the risk for contracting the disease [14,28,30]. Infection control and issues specific to ICU care and resource allocation meant that having a voice was vital. Such lobbying for ICU resources must be started now. The SARS outbreak has taught us that we can no longer accept, without comment or objection, the present need to cope and function, day in and day out, in a situation of inadequate critical care resources and manpower. The importance of having all levels of government understand what critical care is, what our needs are, and the help we require to serve our patients now and in the future is perhaps the most valuable lesson of all that we offer to our readers – one that we learned the hard way from surviving the SARS outbreak.ConclusionSARS emphasized the need for disaster management plans to include new emerging infectious diseases. As our knowledge of SARS-CoV grows, our strategies for diagnosis, treatment and containment will improve. New infectious diseases and/or possibly bioterrorism will take the place of SARS-CoV and will similarly challenge us. Training our staff and our future ICU trainees for such eventualities, through the use of simulators and mock disaster codes, has become necessary to build on our successes and learn from our past to avoid the problems we encountered during SARS.AbbreviationsICU = intensive care unit; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Bench-to-bedside review: Outcome predictions for critically ill patients in the emergency department,"The landscape of critical care delivery in the emergency department (ED) is rapidly changing. The phenomena of hospital and ED overcrowding are increasing in severity and remain unresolved. In the USA there are more than 110 million ED visits per year [1]. The proportion of critically ill patients presenting to the ED and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has also risen. In California alone there was a 59% increase in the number of visits of critically ill patients to the ED from 1990 to 1999 [2]. Inpatient telemetry and ICU beds continue to be fully occupied for a significant amount of the time in many hospitals and is a primary cause of overcrowding in the ED [3,4]. As hospital census approaches 100%, the ED unavoidably becomes a surrogate ICU. Unfortunately, resources are often limited, and critical care delivery in the ED setting is fraught with inadequate space and medical equipment and lack of staffing. Increasingly stringent nurse-patient ratios are being mandated and enforced on the inpatient ward, consequently worsening the overcrowding problem, with ED nurses often far extended over their patient care capacity. ED physicians are often over-extended as well, and adequate critical care is often difficult to provide and sometimes overlooked in a busy ED. Early disease recognition and prognostication of outcome with the aid of physiologic scoring systems is a potentially valuable tool for the multitasking ED physician, and may result in improved critical care when intensive care expertise is not yet available.IntroductionIn addition to the increasing focus on critical care in the ED, the framework of critical care within the ICU is evolving. The evolution of scoring systems has extended beyond just prognostication. Scoring systems now encompass critical care illness as a continuum that extends from the inciting event and treatment (often begun in the ED) to the post-ICU recovery and rehabilitation processes. Physiologic scoring systems are being utilized by clinicians and medical researchers in decision support, outcomes and evaluation research, quality care analysis, and internal and competitive benchmarking. This is the new face of ICU care and supports ongoing development of scoring systems in the ED setting as well [5,6].IntroductionWe review existing physiologic scoring systems designed for application in critically ill patients, and examine how these systems have been applied in the ED. We also focus on scoring systems developed specifically for prognosticating outcome in ED patients.Scoring systems in the intensive care unitIntensivists have used a variety of physiologic scoring systems in clinical decision making over the past few decades. There is currently increased emphasis regarding their use in continuous quality improvement processes, as entry criteria in clinical research trials, and even as indicators of the efficacy of drug therapy [7]. Furthermore, in an era of rising health care expenditure, prognosticating outcome permits earlier detection of patients who will benefit most from early and aggressive therapeutic intervention. Numerous physiologic scoring systems have been developed and used widely in the ICU. Because these scoring systems are well known in the intensive care literature, we review them only briefly here.Scoring systems in the intensive care unitThe Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score is one of the first physiologic scoring systems developed as a mortality prediction model. It is a point scoring system that determines the severity of disease based on the worst measurements of 12 physiologic variables during the first 24 hours of ICU admission, prior health co-morbidities, and age. A high numeric score closely correlates with increased risk for in-hospital death [8]. APACHE II has been subjected to the most validation studies, which show that mortality prediction is accurate, and it is currently the most widely used scoring system in the ICU setting. It has been shown to predict outcome accurately in a variety of medical illnesses, including pancreatitis [9], cirrhotic liver disease [10], infective endocarditis [11], medical complications of oncologic patients [12], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13], gastrointestinal hemorrhage [14], myxedema coma [15], acute myocardial infarction requiring mechanical ventilation [16], and septic abortion [17]. APACHE II has even been shown to be superior to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification in preoperative prediction of postoperative mortality [18]. The latest APACHE III scoring system was shown to be reliable in predicting outcome of surgical ICU patients as well [19,20].Scoring systems in the intensive care unitOther scoring systems such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II [21], Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score [22], Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) [23], Mortality Probability Models [24,25], and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score [26,27] have been shown to be beneficial in predicting resource utilization, organ failure, and mortality in patient populations such as those with cardiovascular disease [28], adult [29] and pediatric [30] trauma, obstetric patients [31], surgical ICU patients [32,33], and nonsurgical ICU patients [34].Scoring systems in the intensive care unitAlthough these systems were originally designed to predict mortality, their use is being progressively expanded to compare clinical trials [35-37] and for criteria to initiate drug therapy; for example, an APACHE II score of 25 or greater is often used as an indication for drotrecogin alfa (activated) in severe sepsis. Hence, there is difference between how scoring systems were derived and how they are being used clinically.Scoring systems in traumaTrauma scoring systems have also been used in the triage of trauma patients and to predict their outcome. Trauma scores have been used to characterize severity of injury and physiologic derangements quantitatively.Scoring systems in traumaThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assesses the severity of head trauma based on three response parameters: eye opening, motor, and verbal response. Compared with other more extensive scoring systems, the GCS has been shown to be superior in predicting outcome, which it does with high sensitivity and specificity [38]. It is also simple to use and readily applied at the bedside. However, inter-rater reliability of GCS scoring was recently shown to be less adequate than was previously believed [39]. Furthermore, the three individual component scores of GCS have similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to that of the total GCS score for predicting ED intubation, neurosurgical intervention, brain injury, and mortality [40].Scoring systems in traumaThe Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) evaluates the need in staffing, monitoring, and therapeutic intervention rather than stratifying severity of illness. Patients are assigned to a class from I to IV, ranging from those who do not require intensive therapy to those patients who are considered physiologically unstable. TISS has been shown to be effective in stratification and prediction of ICU cost [41]. With the new TISS-28, it may be possible to predict post-ICU outcome and identify those high-risk patients who would benefit from further observation [42]. The Trauma Score provides a numerical assessment of central nervous system and cardiopulmonary function. Prediction of survival was shown to be reliable [43]. The Revised Trauma Score is probably the more widely used scoring system currently in trauma and is an accurate predictor of outcome. However, its usefulness as a triage tool was recently questioned [44].Scoring systems in traumaOther trauma scores have been designed using various combinations of physiologic parameters, mechanism, age, GCS, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Examples of these scoring systems include the Injury Severity Score, Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), International Classification Injury Severity Score, and the Physiologic Trauma Score. These scoring systems have been used in a variety of trauma scenarios, including motor vehicle accidents, blunt and penetrating trauma, and even in pediatric polytrauma [43,45-49].Existing scoring systems applied to the emergency departmentED scoring and outcome prediction are innovative but relatively novel concepts. As a result, few scoring systems are specific to the ED setting. Most scoring systems are applicable upon ICU admission and throughout the first 24 hours after admission. These systems usually do not take into account the ED length of stay and course of therapy. Several authors have taken existing physiologic scoring systems, originally designed for application in the non-ED setting, and applied them in the ED and prehospital patient population.Existing scoring systems applied to the emergency departmentFor example, TRISS was used to determine the effectiveness of ground versus air transport for major trauma victims [50]. TRISS accurately predicted 15 out of 15 deaths of the 110 patients transported by ground, but only 33 out of the 46 predicted deaths occurred in the 103 patients transported by air. Even though the study did not randomize patients to receive ground versus air transport, the authors concluded that air transport resulted in better outcome because only 72% of patients predicted to die actually died following air transport. Irrespective, the study suggests that current trauma scoring systems can be applied successfully in prehospital and ED settings.Existing scoring systems applied to the emergency departmentAnother study used three physiologic scoring systems – APACHE II, SAPS II, and MODS – to assess the impact of ED intervention on morbidity and in-hospital mortality [51]. In that prospective, observational cohort study, patients were enrolled and their scores were computed at ED admission, ED discharge, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours in the ICU. The authors applied these scoring systems at specific time points in order to observe the trend in scores over a 72-hour period. Length of ED stay was approximately 6 hours. The hourly decreases in APACHE II, SAPS II, and MODS scores were noted to be most significant during the ED stay, as compared with scores computed during the subsequent 72 hours in the ICU. The APACHE II and SAPS II scores both exhibited notable decreases in predicted mortality during the ED stay. The nontraditional use of these scores allowed the authors to show that the highest scores and predicted mortalities occurred during the ED stay, and that traditional scoring during the first 24 hours after ICU admission (and after initial resuscitation) may not account for the actual severity of disease in the pre-ICU period. Although the study reemphasizes the significant impact that ED intervention has on critically ill patients, it also suggests that existing scoring systems such as APACHE II either are limited to their original design (which is prognosticate to outcome based only on the first 24 hours in the ICU) or need to be recalibrated to include physiologic parameters in the ED [51].Existing scoring systems applied to the emergency departmentSIRS, part of the definition of sepsis, has been used as a predictor of outcome in patients admitted to the ICU from the ED [52]. SIRS in combination with an elevated lactate (≥ 4 mmol/l) in the ED was found to be 98.2% specific for admission to the hospital and the ICU, and 96% specific for predicting mortality in normotensive patients [53,54]. SIRS and elevated lactate (≥ 4 mmol/l) have also been used successfully in the ED as screening variables for initiation of invasive hemodynamic monitoring and early goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis or septic shock patients, resulting in significantly improved outcomes [35]. Because SIRS has been the limiting factor to a better definition of sepsis [55], the addition of lactate in the triaging of patients with a suspected infection may allow ED physicians to identify normotensive patients at high risk for septic shock.Existing scoring systems applied to the emergency departmentThe Pneumonia Severity Index [56] is a measure of severity of community-acquired pneumonia, taking into account physiologic parameters, age, medical co-morbidities, and laboratory studies. Even though it was designed as an outcome prediction tool, the Pneumonia Severity Index is widely used as a determinant for site of care in conjunction with clinical judgment [57] and as a quality assessment tool [58-60].Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThere are a number of physiologic scoring systems designed for use in the ED setting, some of which are discussed below and summarized in Table 1. These systems require several unique characteristics that are inherent to the ED, such as ease of use and bedside availability, accuracy of prediction within a shorter time frame of data collection, and comparability with current ICU scoring systems on hospital admission.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThe Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis Score (MEDS) is a recent scoring system developed from independent variables and univariate correlates of mortality. It was designed to predict patients in the ED who are at risk for infection and to stratify them into risk categories for mortality [61]. A prediction model was developed based on independent multivariate predictors of death, including terminal illness, tachypnea or hypoxia, septic shock, platelet count below 150,000/mm3, band proportion above 5%, age above 65 years, lower respiratory infection, nursing home residence, and altered mental status. Based on the MEDS score, patients in the developmental group were assigned to very low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk categories for mortality. MEDS as a valid outcome prediction model was established in a validation group, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.76 in this group [61]. MEDS is among the first scoring systems to be examined over the natural course of sepsis beginning in the ED. However, the mortality in the study patients of 5.3% is exceedingly low compared with the more familiar sepsis mortality range (16–80%) [62,63]. Thus, studies are needed to validate MEDS before it may be clinically applicable in other ED settings.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThe Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) is an abbreviated version of the APACHE II scoring system. It was developed to predict mortality before, during, and after critical care transport. Limited physiologic parameters available on transport (i.e. pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and GCS) were used and scored numerically [64]. RAPS correlated well with APACHE II score in a comparison analysis (r = 0.85; P < 0.01) [64]. RAPS, when initiated in the prehospital setting and extended into the full APACHE II score upon admission, is highly predictive of mortality [65,66]. RAPS is an efficient scoring system for use in the prehospital setting, but it is probably too abbreviated. Because most of the variables included in the score are vital signs, it may be too sensitive as a prediction tool. For example, patient anxiety during transport, leading to an elevated heart rate or respiratory rate, will easily increase the RAPS score over a very short time interval.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThe Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) is a modification of RAPS, with age and peripheral oxygen saturation added to the RAPS score. Its predictive value is superior to that of RAPS for in-hospital mortality when applied to patients presenting in the ED with common medical issues [67]. The area under the ROC curve is 0.85 for REMS, as compared with 0.65 for RAPS (P < 0.05) [67]. REMS has also been shown to have predictive accuracy similar to that of APACHE II [68]. A clinician can easily expand a REMS score into the full APACHE II score. Thus, an APACHE II score can be quickly calculated by the intensivist with a few additional parameters once the patient is admitted to the ICU. Although studies have examined its application in the ED, these studies are limited to the nonsurgical patient population.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThe Mainz Emergency Evaluation Systems (MEES) was developed in Germany to assess prehospital therapeutic efficacy. It is based on seven variables: level of consciousness, heart rate, heart rhythm, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, partial arterial oxygen saturation, and pain. A MEES score is obtained before and after prehospital intervention to assess patient improvement or deterioration. Although it does not allow outcome prediction, it does provide an easy and reliable assessment of prehospital care [43,69]. A recent study [70] showed that adding end-tidal carbon dioxide capnometry to MEES has significantly greater value than MEES alone in predicting survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in nontraumatic cardiac arrest.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentIn Taiwan, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) screening scores were developed specifically for prediction of this syndrome in febrile ED patients. Recently, two of these SARS screening scores, the four-item symptom score and the six-item clinical score, were tested and validated in different cohorts in Taiwan and were found to have good sensitivity and specificity for predicting SARS [71]. The study suggests that these scores could be used as a tool for mass screening in case of future outbreaks. However, they would not be applicable for screening on a case-by-case basis outside endemic regions.Scoring systems developed for use in the emergency departmentThe Pediatric Risk of Admission score includes nine physiologic variables, three medical history components, three chronic disease factors, two therapies, and four interaction terms. This score provides a probability of admission from the ED for pediatric patients. It was shown to be reliable in predicting admission and providing a measure of illness severity [72-74]. Although the score was not designed specifically for outcome prediction, it is an example of the use of scoring systems to risk stratify and triage patients in the ED.ConclusionEmergency physicians have the opportunity to have a significant impact on the initial evaluation and treatment of the critically ill patient. Application of outcome prediction models in the form of physiologic scoring systems allows early recognition of illness severity and initiation of evidence-based therapeutic interventions. In the presence of overcrowded, under-staffed EDs, the utility of efficient and bedside physiologic scoring systems can be of tremendous value to the multitasking ED physician. As technology advances, immediate access to patient data and the availability of ED scoring systems on hand-held computers will further facilitate outcome prediction. However, the current development, implementation, and verification of these systems in the ED setting are limited.ConclusionUnique physiologic assessment tools and outcome prediction models should be developed for use in the ED setting. Physiologic scoring systems such as APACHE II, SAPS II, and MODS were developed to measure illness severity objectively, to provide mortality risk probabilities, and to evaluate the performance of ICUs. When these models are applied in the ED setting, lead-time bias may result because these systems were not originally designed to account for pre-ICU illness severity [51]. Thus, similar models specific to the ED should include the following: variables that reflect prehospital severity of illness and are commonly obtained in the ED; use of practical time-indexed variables that reflect response to treatment delivered in dynamic resuscitation during ED care; creation of an independent, multicenter database to establish adequate sample size and power for the development and validation of the model [21,75-79]; analysis of the relationships among the predictive variables and actual patient outcome for overall calibration and reliability of the model; establishment of outcomes other than mortality, such as patient disposition, number of return visits to the ED, lengths of ED and ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation, and functional status at hospital discharge [80]; and the ability to be correlated with more established scoring systems already in place in ICUs.ConclusionOutcome prediction science is not considered synonymous to physician clinical judgment. However, the intent of prediction models is to reduce clinician variability and improve the overall accuracy of prognostic estimates. An ED patient-specific prediction model can assist clinicians by providing greater certainty in the effects of interventions provided in the ED; improving the understanding of existing physiologic measurements and their influence on outcomes; reducing variations in individual clinical judgment on the severity of patient illness at ED presentation; allowing for comparison of probability thresholds to guide important clinical decisions; and providing a common measurement tool with which to compare performance among EDs [80,81]. Physiologic assessment tools can also identify outliers by comparing actual outcomes with expected outcomes, and thus provide opportunities for quality improvement if inadequacies of care are identified in case reviews. However, it must be recognized that physiologic scoring systems are typically developed to provide estimates of outcome for a group of patients, and not to predict individual patient outcome. In addition, they should not be used to make end-of-life decisions in emergency situations.ConclusionMost EDs are staffed for short-term stabilization of critically ill patients. Because of overcrowding and prolonged ED lengths of stay, the care provided to patients with such high acuity may vary and is limited by available equipment, training, and staff-patient ratios. Methodologies such as physiologic scoring systems to assess the quality and quantity of critical care delivered will serve as tools to help remedy the varying care delivered in the ED setting. Thus unique physiologic assessment methodologies should be developed to examine and improve the quality of patient care, enhance the precision of clinical research, aid in resource allocation, improve the accuracy of prognostic decisions, and objectively measure the impact of clinical interventions and pathways in the ED.AbbreviationsAPACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; ED = emergency department; GCS = Glasgow Come Scale; ICU = intensive care unit; MEDS = Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis Score; MEES = Mainz Emergency Evaluation Systems; MODS = Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score; RAPS = Rapid Acute Physiology Score; REMS = Rapid Emergency Medicine Score; ROC = receiver operating characteristic; SAPS = Simplified Acute Physiology Score; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome; SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome; TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System; TRISS = Trauma and Injury Severity Score.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Critical care during epidemics,"We recommend several actions that could improve hospitals' and communities' abilities to deliver critical care during epidemics and bioterrorist attacks involving large numbers of victims with life-threatening illness. These recommendations are in part the result of deliberations by the multidisciplinary Working Group on Emergency Mass Medical Care, which comprises 33 professionals with expertise in critical care medicine, biosecurity, disaster preparedness, and infection control (Rubinson et al., unpublished data).IntroductionIn countries with widespread critical care capabilities few, if any, critically ill survivors of traumatic disasters have had to forgo acceptable critical care because of staff or resource shortages [1-7]. In contrast, a naturally occurring disease outbreak or a deliberate epidemic resulting from a covert bioterrorist attack could generate critically ill victims in numbers that greatly exceed a hospital's – or a region's – capacity to deliver traditional critical care [8,9] (Rubinson et al., unpublished data). In the absence of careful pre-event planning, demand for critical care services may quickly exceed available intensive care unit (ICU) staff, beds and equipment, leaving the bulk of the infected populace without the benefit of potentially life-saving critical care.IntroductionIt is likely that critically ill victims who present to hospitals early in the course of the epidemic – that is, some fraction of the total population who are infected and will become symptomatic – will receive 'traditional' critical care in hospital ICUs. Even with stockpiling of airway equipment, vaso-pressors, and mechanical ventilators (which are important components of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile [10]), shortages of staff trained in critical care and limited quantities of the vast array of medications and medical equipment commonly used in ICUs make it unlikely that current standards of critical care could be provided for more than just a handful of seriously ill victims. If immediate evacuation of critically ill patients to unaffected hospitals or deployment of critical care trained and equipped medical teams to the affected region are not possible, then we propose that, in such situations, more lives could be saved if a circumscribed set of key critical care interventions were offered to a larger number of patients than if traditional critical care interventions, with all their incumbent human and material resource requirements (i.e. usual standards of critical care), were provided only to a small number of initial victims (Rubinson et al., unpublished data).IntroductionEmergency mass critical care requires modification to standards of critical care interventions, staffing, equipment, and triage to provide an acceptable level of care for large numbers of critically ill victims. At a minimum, hospitals should plan to be able to deliver to critically ill patients a basic mode(s) of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, antibiotic or other disease-specific countermeasure therapy, and a small set of prophylactic interventions that are recognized to reduce the serious adverse consequences of critical illness. A detailed rationale for and specifics of these recommendations will be provided in a publication from the Working Group on Emergency Mass Critical Care (Rubinson et al., unpublished data). We encourage the critical care community to review these recommendations, revise and modify them as deemed necessary, and prepare to implement rational, modified medical protocols in the wake of a significant disease outbreak that overwhelms current capacities to deliver 'traditional' critical care.TriageDuring a large or sustained epidemic, even after modification of critical care standards, available resources will remain taxed. Priority should be given to people most likely to benefit from modified critical care interventions. We encourage the critical care community to develop triage algorithms for clinical conditions that are likely to be seen in most outbreaks (e.g. severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) that are based on physiologic parameters, and that are sufficiently discriminating to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from emergency mass critical care. We caution against unvalidated application of triage algorithms originally designed for use in trauma casualties to victims with medical illnesses, because these algorithms may not accurately categorize survival for critically ill medical patients.TriageA major challenge during an epidemic or other mass casualty emergency will be to determine when, and on what basis, traditional standards of critical care are modified to accommodate emergency conditions, and when modified standards revert to traditional modes of care. Medical professionals, hospital staff, and the affected patient community should actively participate in the development and review of mass care triage standards and protocols. If engagement of care givers and the community is neglected, then mass casualty standards could be misinterpreted and generate distrust or fail to be implemented during a disaster. Medical personnel and community members must understand and agree with the triage plans and be assured that implementation will be fairly applied to all victims. Extensive efforts must be undertaken to guarantee that vulnerable populations will receive equal treatment. Coordination of all affected hospitals to facilitate implementation of similar measures under similar conditions and to reinforce the reality of fairness would be useful, but there is no such 'organizing authority' within the fragmented and mostly private US health care system.Achieving situational awarenessIn natural disasters or terrorist attacks resulting in traumatic injuries, a roughly accurate number of surviving casualties requiring medical care is usually quickly ascertained (within hours). Epidemics differ from other disasters in that they unfold over days or even months and years. The scope and impact of epidemics (whether natural or deliberate) are not immediately apparent. If a bioattack is discovered to have occurred (e.g. if several people within a community present with inhalational anthrax), then it may be impossible to determine quickly whether there has been one attack or several or to ascertain rapidly who else is at risk. It is usually not possible to predict accurately how big an epidemic will become or how fast it can be quenched. This uncertainty has important implications for the medical mass casualty response. How is the decision made to initiate mass casualty protocols or to turn them off? How do hospitals and other health care providers plan for and implement sustained emergency responses unless they know whether an epidemic is waning or expanding?Achieving situational awarenessIn an age of bioterrorism and epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, it will be necessary to establish interconnected electronic health information technology systems with the capacity to track patterns of disease in populations in near real time. Rapid learning in the face of an outbreak will be essential. Health information technology systems that enable sharing and near real time analysis of aggregated data could be invaluable for illuminating the course of new or unfamiliar diseases, improving clinical diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy, predicting disease outcome, and refining triage protocols. Early in an outbreak a number of treatments may be used, but if they are administered in an uncontrolled manner at the whim of clinicians then determination of their effectiveness may be difficult or impossible. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, more than 8000 people became ill over several months, and a number of treatment modalities were pursued (e.g. steroids, interferon, and ribaviran), but none within the context of a clinical trials. Were another large SARS outbreak to occur tomorrow, clinicians would have no more clinical trial data on which to base treatment decisions than they had 2 years ago [11]. To help assess treatments during the chaotic atmosphere of an outbreak, technology systems that could capture and aggregate data for large, simple, near real time clinical trials could be invaluable.Protection of health care workers and disease containmentContagious pathogens present singular operational challenges that must be anticipated in planning for mass casualty critical care. Hospitals are typically major sources of secondary transmission during outbreaks, and the SARS experience demonstrates that critical care units pose potentially high risks for disease transmission to health care workers and other patients [12]. ICUs in Toronto cared for approximately 80 SARS patients over 4 months, and because of secondary transmission 73 ICU beds (nearly one-third of community and academic medical center ICU beds) were closed for some period during the outbreak [13]. The lesson is that secondary transmission of disease, even with modest numbers of contagious critically ill patients, may force closure of entire ICUs or compel isolation of hospital staff, thus decreasing the critical care capacity just when it is most needed.Protection of health care workers and disease containmentAll critical care staff should be explicitly and routinely trained in infection control procedures, including how to don and remove personal protective equipment without self-contaminating; what protection is afforded by different levels of personal protective equipment; and what environmental controls must be employed for given situations. Because illness due to newly emergent pathogens or to bioweapons may present with signs and symptoms that are seen commonly in critically ill patients, and because relevant, point-of-service rapid diagnostic tests are not likely to be available at the outset of a disease outbreak, leaders of critical care units should consider implementing droplet and contact precautions for all critically ill patients with febrile respiratory illnesses, even during non-outbreak conditions.ConclusionHistorically, critical care has played only a small role in the response to disasters, but the nature of disasters in the era of globalization and catastrophic terrorism is changing. The toll of death, morbidity, and public confidence wreaked by a deliberate or naturally occurring epidemic of infectious disease may be highly dependent on the critical care response. Critical care providers must take the lead in planning and preparing to care for numbers of critically ill patients that far exceed available ICU beds.AbbreviationsICU = intensive care unit; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Pneumothorax and mortality in the mechanically ventilated SARS patients: a prospective clinical study,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a transmissible pulmonary infection caused by a novel coronavirus [1,2]. About 20 to 30% of SARS patients may progress to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission [3-6]. Pneumothorax, a major and potentially lethal complication of SARS and mechanical ventilation, often complicates the management of mechanically ventilated patients, and would be especially hazardous for patients in an individually isolated SARS ICU. Peiris et al. identified a high incidence of pneumomediastinum (12%) in a general population of SARS patients [3]. In addition, Lew and Fowler also observed a high incidence of pneumothorax (20 to 34%) in mechanically ventilated SARS patients [6,7]. However, no further investigations have assessed the risk factors of pneumothorax in the mechanically ventilated SARS patients.IntroductionPatients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) [8] developing pneumothorax have been extensively studied. Previous studies have found that high inspiratory airway pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were correlated with barotraumas [9-11]. Eisner et al. analyzed a cohort of 718 patients with ALI/ARDS and revealed that higher PEEP was related to an increased risk of barotraumas [12]. However, others were unable to identify any relationship between barotrauma and high ventilatory pressure or volume in patients with early ARDS [13-15]. Therefore, the relationship between airway pressure or volume and the development of barotraumas remains uncertain.IntroductionTo our knowledge, there is no study on the risk factors of pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated SARS patients. To address this issue, we performed a prospective study to determine whether pneumothorax was produced by high ventilatory pressure or volume, and if it was associated with an increased mortality rate at 30 days after mechanical ventilation.Materials and methodsThis study included patients with SARS who were admitted to an isolation ICU at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. All patients satisfied the WHO case definition for SARS [16]. The research ethics board approved the study and we enrolled 41 patients with SARS who received mechanical ventilation between 14 May 2003 and 18 July 2003. Patients with pre-existing pneumothorax or chest tube thoracostomy were excluded. The primary study outcome variable was defined as radiographic evidence of new-onset pneumothorax at 30 days after ventilator use. Patients were censored at the first pneumothorax event, at the time of death, liberation from mechanical ventilation or discharge from the SARS ICU. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation were sedated with midazolam or propofol to facilitate mechanical ventilation; meanwhile, the sedatives were adjusted according to the Ramsay sedation score. Moreover, atracurium was used for neuromuscular paralysis to facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony in some patients. The dosage of atracurium was adjusted by peripheral nerve stimulator. When the patient was ready for weaning according to defined criteria, sedation and/or neuromuscular paralysis were discontinued.Materials and methodsPatient sex, age, actual body weight, APACHE II score and pre-existing comorbidities were recorded at entry. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaO2, PaCO2, FiO2 and lung injury score [17] were recorded on ICU admission and daily during hospitalization. Ventilatory variables including PEEP, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure (MAP), tidal volume, tidal volume per kilogram, respiratory rate and minute ventilation were recorded at least once a day during the period of mechanical ventilation. When pneumothorax occurred, the highest pressure or volume of mechanical ventilation before the onset of pneumothorax were most likely to be the cause of pneumothorax [14]. Therefore, we compared the highest value of pressure and volume within a 24-hour period before the event in the patients with pneumothorax, with the overall values during mechanical ventilation in patients without pneumothorax.Materials and methodsData were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare data between patients with and without pneumothorax. We compared risk factors associated with the development of pneumothorax by Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Non-parametric tests were chosen because of the small sample size in the pneumothorax group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by using the log-rank test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SPSS software (v10.0) for all analyses.ResultsDemographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Of the 41 patients, the male-to-female ratio was 1:0.37 and mean age was 75.4 years. Five patients developed pneumothorax and the incidence of pneumothorax was 12%. The mean time to the development of pneumothorax was 8.0 ± 4.4 days after ventilator use. Of the patients, 28 (68%) met the criteria for either ALI or ARDS. Patients with pneumothorax were significantly associated with higher respiratory rate on admission, and more pronounced hypoxemia with lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher PaCO2 during hospitalization.ResultsTable 2 compares ventilator variables according to the presence or absence of pneumothorax. There were no significant differences in any pressure or volume between the patients with and without pneumothorax.ResultsThe overall survival rate was 59% at 30 days after mechanical ventilation. The relationship between pneumothorax and the probability of survival is shown in Fig. 1. There were no significant differences between the patients with and without pneumothorax.DiscussionIn the present study, we focused on the mechanically ventilated SARS patients and analyzed the risk factors of pneumothorax. Our study demonstrated that mechanically ventilated SARS patients with higher baseline respiratory rate, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and higher PaCO2 during hospitalization were at a greater risk of developing pneumothorax. There were no significant differences in pressure, volume and mortality rate between the patients without and with pneumothorax. Barotrauma is a common complication in patients with SARS. The previous study by Peiris identified a high incidence of pneumomediastinum (12%) in a general population of SARS patients [3]. Choi et al. had also shown that subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum were detected in six SARS patients (2.2%) who had not received positive-pressure ventilation [18].DiscussionIn our study, the incidence of pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated SARS patients was lower than previous studies (12% versus 20 to 34%) [6,7]. The incidence of barotrauma in patients with ALI/ARDS varies widely. In most recent studies, it has ranged from 5 to 15% [12,14,19]. Gammon and colleagues have shown that the presence of ARDS is the major independent risk factor of barotraumas [13,20]. This may explain the lower incidence of pneumothorax in our study since the proportion of our patients with ALI/ARDS (68%) is lower than the other studies [6,7].DiscussionAnother important finding in our study was the lack of correlation between ventilator variables and the presence of pneumothorax. Our results agreed with most of the previous studies that were done on ARDS patients. In the ARDS Network randomized controlled trial, low tidal volume ventilation decreased mortality without influencing the incidence of barotraumas [19]. In patients with sepsis-induced ARDS, there were no significant correlations between the ventilatory parameters and the development of pneumothorax or another air leak [14]. These authors suggested that barotrauma was more related to the underlying process than to the ventilator settings [14,15].DiscussionWe found that the mechanically ventilated SARS patients with pneumothorax had a significant baseline tachypnea. Additionally, patients with a higher respiratory rate on admission also showed a trend of higher respiratory rate during hospitalization. (p = 0.06). Tachypnea on admission probably reflected the increased severity of the underlying disease [21], which may directly lead to a higher incidence of pneumothorax. There was also a higher risk of auto-PEEP in patients with tachypnea due to insufficient expiratory time, which may also contribute to the development of pneumothorax. However, auto-PEEP was not recorded in this study.DiscussionIn our study, SARS patients with pneumothorax had a higher PaCO2 during hospitalization. Gattinoni et al. also observed a similar finding in ARDS patients with pneumothorax [11]. Increased dead space and cystic changes of lung parenchyma due to worsening underlying disease played a major role in patients with hypercapnia. This mechanism is further supported by a thin-section computed tomographic study that was done by Joynt and colleagues on the late stage of ARDS (more than 2 weeks after onset) caused by SARS [22]. They found that severe SARS-induced ARDS might independently result in cyst formation. In our study, patients with pneumothorax were also associated with a more pronounced hypoxemia, with lower PaO2/FiO2 during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax (65.8 versus 210.1). Oxygen-diffusing impairment and ventilation-perfusion maldistribution may play a role in developing hypoxemia in the mechanically ventilated SARS patient. A decrease in PaO2/FiO2 and increase in PaCO2 may be considered as a deterioration of respiratory condition in a patient with ALI/ARDS. The presence of pneumothorax together with hypoxemia/hypercapnia may indicate worsening of the underlying disease. This is supported by the large difference in APACHE II (26.0 ± 11.8 versus 20.7 ± 6.6) and ALI (2.51 ± 0.29 versus 1.59 ± 1.10) scores between patients with and without pneumothorax in this study, although these did not reach statistical significance.DiscussionIn our study, the mortality rate was not significantly increased in patients with pneumothorax. In other studies on ALI/ARDS, the mortality directly attributable to barotrauma was low [12,14,23]. The mortality rate was 41% in our study, which was higher than the 26% from the results of five cohort studies [2-4,24,25]. Older age and more comorbidities may be the major causes. Age and coexisting illness, especially diabetes mellitus and heart disease, were consistently found to be independent prognostic factors for the risk of death and the need for intensive care in SARS patients [3-5,26,27].DiscussionThere are several limitations to our study. Data were recorded once daily in individual isolation rooms and may have missed transient elevations in airway pressure/volume that could have led to alveolar disruption and pneumothorax. Secondly, we selected parameters that were easily measured and were previously shown or theorized to contribute to alveolar disruption, including ventilator variables and high-risk disease states. However, it is possible that an important variable such as plateau pressure was omitted from this analysis. Thirdly, there were only 41 mechanically ventilated SARS patients in our study. A study with a larger sample size may demonstrate statistical significance. The above factors are likely to cloud the relationship between the ventilatory variables and the occurrence of barotrauma.ConclusionThe analysis of pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated SARS patients indicates that the patients with higher respiratory rates on admission, and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher PaCO2 during hospitalization had a greater risk of pneumothorax. The correlation between the clinical characteristics and pneumothorax may be considered as a deterioration of respiratory function in mechanically ventilated SARS patients developing pneumothorax. Pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated SARS patients may be an indicator of worsening underlying lung disease.Key messages•         There were no significant differences in pressure, volume and mortality rate between the mechanically ventilated SARS patients without or with pneumothorax.Key messages•         Mechanically ventilated SARS patients with higher baseline respiratory rate, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and higher PaCO2 during hospitalization were at a greater risk of developing pneumothorax.Key messages•         The correlation between the clinical characteristics and pneumothorax may be considered as a deterioration of respiratory function in mechanically ventilated SARS patients developing pneumothorax.AbbreviationsALI = acute lung injury; APACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; FiO2 = fraction of inspired oxygen; MAP = mean airway pressure; ICU = intensive care unit; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; PIP = peak inspiratory pressure,  SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsT-CL participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis.

Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict and monitor the number of beds occupied during a SARS outbreak in a tertiary hospital in Singapore,"Early isolation of infectious cases has been shown to be a key component for the successful management of SARS outbreaks[1]. Due to the potential for nosocomial transmission[2-6], the imperfect ability of clinical criteria to distinguish cases of SARS at presentation[7], the possibility of atypical presentations[8,9], and the lack of a sensitive diagnostic test in early disease[10], front-line clinicians need to err on the side of caution when admitting cases, and isolate patients until SARS can be clinically and virologically ruled out. As a result, the number of admissions and isolation beds required during management of SARS outbreaks can be expected to significantly exceed that used for actual SARS cases.BackgroundWhile hospitals are generally built with a fixed ratio of isolation to general ward beds, surge capacity for isolation beds can be met by conversion of single room wards, decanting of existing patients with lesser indications for isolation, and activation of isolation facilities at alternative sites and institutions. However, these processes require time, and the ability to forecast requirements is hence a critical component of efficient outbreak management.BackgroundDuring SARS outbreak in Singapore from 1 Mar to 31 May 2003, the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) was the initial designated facility for the screening management of all SARS cases, beginning on 14 Mar 2003, two days after the WHO alert was sounded on 12 Mar[11]. To accommodate the surge in cases, the parent hospital of the CDC, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) became designated as the central facility for management of all SARS cases in Singapore from 22 Mar 2003[12]. As a result of the above policy, 231 of 238 SARS cases diagnosed during the Singapore outbreak were admitted to TTSH. TTSH bed utilization patterns here hence reflect national level requirements for outbreak management. Various papers have described qualitative aspects of hospital management during SARS[13-15], but none have provided quantitative tools for predicting requirements for isolation beds. Yet such quantitative models would be of great utility to both hospital administrators and national level planners during outbreak management.BackgroundThe main objective of this study is to apply autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to make real-time predictions on the number of beds occupied in TTSH during the SARS outbreak, starting from 14 Mar 2003, when the CDC was activated, to 31 May 2003 when Singapore was declared SARS free.MethodsThis was a retrospective study design. Hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14th March 2003 to 31st May 2003. The main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients, including those fulfilling WHO criteria for suspect and probable SARS[16], as well as those admitted not fulfilling WHO case definitions but admitted to isolation rooms for observation. Among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted (including observation, suspect and probable cases) and days from the most recent significant event discovery. Key events considered were as follows:Methods1. 14th Mar: discovery of the TTSH outbreakMethods2. 22nd Mar: press release that TTSH would dedicated to SARS managementMethods3. 4th Apr: discovery of an outbreak at Singapore General Hospital (SGH)Methods4. 11th Apr: discovery of an outbreak at National University Hospital (NUH)Methods5. 20th Apr: discovery and press release on an outbreak at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM)Methods6. 13th May: discovery of a cluster of febrile staff and patients at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)MethodsDetails on the above can be found in the chronology of press releases on SARS events in Singapore[17]. Events 1–5 all involved probable SARS cases, whereas event 6 proved to be a false alarm[18].MethodsWe utilized the following strategy for the analysis. Firstly, we split the outbreak data into two. Data from 14th March to 21st April 2003 was used for model development. We used structural ARIMA models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied[19]. Estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the Kalman filter[20]. For the ARIMA model parameters, we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model.MethodsWe computed various permutations of the order of correlation (AR), order of integration (I) and order of moving average (MA), and chose the optimal combination of parameters using the mean square error. The correlogram and partial correlogram graphs were also used to help in deciding the order of moving average (MA) and auto-regressive (AR) terms to include in the model. To ensure the model was robust to symmetric nonnormality in the disturbances, including heteroskedasticity, we computed Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance for the coefficient estimates[21]. Before modeling the bed occupancy, we examined whether the series was stationary. In the event of non-stationarity, we opted to set an a-prior value of 1 for starting the Kalman recursions[22].MethodsWe used the likelihood ratio test to determine if inclusion of other covariates helped improve the fit of the model. Based on the final model selected, we assessed the out-sample validity of the model, by applying the model to predict the number of beds occupied for the remaining period of the outbreak (i.e. 22nd April 2003 to 31st May 2003). In addition, we also made three-day forecasts for selected periods during the outbreak, starting from day 4 of the outbreak. We used the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to measure and quantify the quality of fit. A lower MAPE value will indicate a better fit of the data. All tests were conducted at the 5% level of significance, and data analysis was performed in Stata V7.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).ResultsFrom 14th March 2003 to 31st May 2003, the median daily number of beds occupied was 134 (IQR: 105–193). The range was 15 to 238 beds. The number of beds occupied reached it's peak on the 24th and 28th of April 2003, with a total of 238 beds. For the final ARIMA model, we found that the ARIMA (1,0,3) model was the most suitable, with an auto-regression term of 1 and a moving average term of 3. The correlogram indicated that there was a significant autocorrelation out to about 3 lags, and this autocorrelation decayed slowly over time (figure 1). The partial auto correlation function (PACF) plot suggested that the only highly significant partial autocorrelation occurred at one lag (figure 2). We found that the AR(1) coefficient of 1.02 and MA(3) coefficient of -0.95 were significant (p < 0.05). The likelihood ratio test indicated that the total number of admissions on the previous day and number of probable cases admitted on the previous day were significant predictors, and these variables were thus included in the final model. Furthermore, the estimated variance of the white-noise disturbance was found to be 4.47 (see table 1). Days from most recent significant event discovery and number of patients screened were not found to be significant predictors of daily number of isolation beds occupied.ResultsAs we can see from figure 3, the predictions from the ARIMA model performed reasonably well, both for the training and validation data. The MAPE for the training set and validation set were 5.7% and 8.6% respectively. This translated to an error rate of ± 7 beds and ± 13 beds respectively. We have also provided the model parameters and their corresponding MAPE values for some of the alternative ARIMA models that we had considered (table 2).ResultsFor three-day predictions, we found that the model fared reasonably well (see table 3). For day 4 to day 6 of the outbreak, the error rate was 6%. For day 7 to day 9, the rate was 10%, day 10 to day 12, 7% and finally, for day 13 to day 15, it was 9%. Although the MAPE values were within reasonable levels, we note that generally, the model under-predicts in the early stage of the outbreak, and over-predicts in the later stage of the outbreak (tables 3 and 4).DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest the application of a known statistical method such as the ARIMA model, to predict and monitor the utilization of hospital isolation beds during the recent SARS outbreak in Singapore, for which Tan Tock Seng Hospital was the designated hospital for all patients presenting with SARS-like symptoms and exposures.DiscussionARIMA models have traditionally found application in the financial sector. There has been limited literature on their use in healthcare; recent examples include their use in assessment of seasonal variation in selected medical conditions[23], and as a surveillance tool for outbreak detection[24]. There has been some research indicating that time series modeling may be more appropriate than the simple trend fitting approach, which suffers from model specification error[25]. ARIMA models have been used to forecast attendance at accident and emergency departments in the United Kingdom. Particularly, researchers have shown that the forecasting methodology can be improved by incorporating the ARIMA method[26]. Here, we show that the ARIMA model can be used over the much shorter time-frame of a single outbreak to forecast bed-utilization. The three-day forecasts from the model are fairly reasonable. The MAPE is low, allowing planners to confidently decide, with sufficient lead-time, on the need to open new isolation wards, each of which, in our setting, holds between 10 to 20 patients.DiscussionHowever, the model has its limitations. Firstly, unmeasured confounders could have affected the results of this study, although we have accounted for measured confounders by incorporating significant covariates into the final model. Secondly, the most significant covariate was the number of probable SARS cases admitted. This is not surprising, as probable SARS cases stayed longer in isolation facilities compared to cases which turned out not to be SARS (unpublished data). In this analysis, we used the final classification for each case after a variable period of observation and investigation, and not the admission classification.DiscussionThis approach was chosen, as time required to confirm cases will be likely be shortened in any future outbreaks, in view of various advancements for SARS diagnostics[27,28]. However, it is still uncertain what proportion of SARS cases can be accurately classified on admission, and this may affect model performance. Another point to note is that the model generally under-predicts the number of beds occupied in the early stage of the outbreak and over-predicts at the later stage of the outbreak for three-day forecasts. One possible explanation could be that the model was derived from the first half of the data and applied to both the first and second halves of the outbreak. It is important for administrators to take this into account during bed planning, perhaps by allowing for appropriate buffer beds. Lastly, the ARIMA model parameters may differ under different practice protocols within different outbreak settings as well as between different SARS afflicted countries. It would be useful to calibrate the model using individual country level data. We would recommend that, in an actual outbreak, real-time calibration be performed, with additional data available on each day fed-back into the model to improve its predictive ability.DiscussionThe application of ARIMA models in bed utilization is not only useful for an outbreak of SARS and emerging infectious diseases, but also for projecting resource requirements in bioterrorism events. It has been recognized by others that resource requirements will not include just isolation beds, but also outpatient resources[29], pharmaceuticals[30], as well as intensive care facilities[31]; few articles, however, have proposed any models for forecasting such requirements. The challenge, therefore, lies in the collection of timely surveillance and resource utilization data for this specific purpose, peace-time exploration of the most appropriate methods of analysis, and real-time validation and application in the event of an outbreak.ConclusionThe ARIMA model that we developed for modeling the number of beds occupied during the SARS outbreak performed reasonably well, with a MAPE of 5.7% for the training set, and 8.6% for the validation set. In addition, we found that three-day forecasts provided a reasonable prediction of the number of beds required during the outbreakConclusionARIMA models provide useful tools for administrators and clinicians in planning the use of isolation beds during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. The model could be used in planning for bed-capacity during outbreaks of other infectious diseases, as well as predicting requirements for other critical resources.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsDN conceived the study and contributed to the study design, analysis and interpretation.

A simple and rapid approach for screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes: an evaluation study,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease which led to a global epidemic between 2002 and 2003. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent [1]. The genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV was promptly characterized [2,3]. Thereafter, studies had focused on the early detection of SARS-CoV and the development of diagnostic tools [4-6]. Systematic analysis of the SARS-CoV sequence information have demonstrated that characteristic viral genotypes predominated at certain periods during the course of the outbreak [7-10]. Furthermore, characterization of the viral sequences have been shown to be a useful tool for confirming epidemiological associations between infected individuals as suspected from conventional epidemiological investigations [9-11]. In-depth analysis of the available sequence data on SARS-CoV also revealed that the viral isolates could be readily subclassified into several major genotypes based on nucleotide variations at specific genomic positions [8,12]. In a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV sequences [8], a 5-nucleotide motif at the GZ02 [GenBank :AY390556] reference nucleotide residues 17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and 27,827 was identified to be most useful for distinguishing the major SARS-CoV genotypes. These major viral genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic [8]. Thus, it is evident that viral sequence and molecular epidemiological data provide valuable information and tools for our combat against infectious diseases. However, direct sequencing of viral isolates from a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, a rapid system for the characterization and screening of viral genotypes, such as for SARS-CoV, would potentially be useful. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of the adoption of allelic discrimination assays based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for the genotyping of SARS-CoV isolates.Study population ::: MethodsViral culture isolates from 30 SARS patients who were admitted to the hospitals of the New Territories East Cluster of Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic were retrieved. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. SARS was confirmed in all cases either by positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens or documented seroconversion.Genotype analysis by Taqman allelic discrimination assay ::: MethodsWe focused on the development of allelic discrimination assays for the five previously described characteristic single nucleotide variations (SNV) [8]. RNA was extracted from viral isolates cultured from SARS patients' clinical specimens using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Eleven microliters of the extracted viral RNA was reverse transcribed by Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with random hexamer according to manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping of the five SNVs was determined using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) allelic discrimination assays on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Each assay consisted of two allele-specific minor groove binding probes associated with either, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or VIC™ as the fluorescent label, for the discrimination of the two respective alleles at each SNV locus. One assay was designed for each of the 5 SNVs. The primer and probe sequences, designed using the Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) are listed in Table 1. The probes were designed such that the discriminatory nucleotide is placed close to the middle portion of the oligonucleotide. The assays were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions (TaqMan Core PCR Kit; Applied Biosystems) in a reaction volume of 25 μL. Each reaction consists of 1X Buffer A, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM dATP, 0.2 μM dCTP, 0.2 μM dGTP and 0.4 μM dUTP, 900 nM forward and reverse primers, 200 nM of each fluorescent probe, 0.25U UNG, 0.625U Taq polymerase and 0.5 μl of cDNA as template. The thermal profile consists of an initial incubation at 50°C for 2 min, and then a denaturation period at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92°C for 15 s, and 1 min of combined annealing and extension at 60°C. The genotypes were scored with the SDS2.1 software.Sequence confirmation by direct sequencing ::: MethodsAll viral sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing. RT-PCR was performed to specifically amplify genomic segments of SARS-CoV encompassing each of the 5 SNVs using primers and protocols previously described [7]. The DNA of each amplicon was sequenced by the dideoxy terminator method on an automated DNA sequencer (3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) based on capillary electrophoresis.Results and discussionTaqman allelic discrimination assays for the 5 SNVs were first tested on synthetic templates (Sigma Genosys, Australia) (Table 1) and verified using 2 viral isolates, CUHK-W1 [GenBank :AY278554] and CUHK-Su10 [GenBank :AY282752]. CUHK-W1 is a SARS-CoV isolate with a G:A:C:T:C motif at the GZ02 reference nucleotide residues 17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and 27,827, characteristic of SARS-CoV strains isolated before worldwide dissemination of SARS [8,13]. On the other hand, CUHK-Su10 demonstrates a T:G:T:T:T motif which is characteristic of SARS-CoV strains isolated after global spread was evident. As evident from figure 1, the newly developed allelic discrimination assays were able to differentiate the 2 viral isolates and genotype each SNV correctly (Table 1).Results and discussionFollowing initial development and optimization, the allelic discrimination assays were used to genotype SARS-CoV in clinical samples. We were able to successfully determine the SARS-CoV genotypes in all 30 samples. Genotypes of virus isolates at the 5 SNV positions are shown in Table 2. SARS-CoV from all but seven cases showed the T:G:T:T:T motif resembling that of the CUHK-Su 10 isolate. For the remaining seven cases, no allelic signal was detected at SNV position 27,827 (Figure 2), leading to a T:G:T:T:/ motif.Results and discussionThe SARS-CoV genotypes isolated from the 30 patients were also confirmed by direct sequencing. The sequencing results were fully concordant with that based on the allelic discrimination assays at all the 5 SNVs. The seven samples which gave no allelic signal by the allelic discrimination assay at SNV 27,827 showed a shortened amplicon encompassing the region. Direct sequencing of this short amplicon revealed a deletion of 386 nt identical to a SARS-CoV deletion variant previously reported by our group [8,9]. This deletion variant was first isolated from a discrete cohort of 15 epidemiologically related SARS patients [9]. In the previous cohort of patients, the origin of the deletion variant was traceable to mid-April 2003 in two patients residing in an estate, T, in Hong Kong with subsequent spread predominantly at the North District Hospital, Hong Kong [9]. To further determine if the newly identified cases were epidemiologically related to the original patient cohort, the case histories were reviewed.Results and discussionThe seven patients had fever onset between April 4 to 15, 2003 which predated the disease onset dates of all cases in the original patient cohort. All but one patient presented to hospital A initially for other medical conditions without fever or evidence of chest infection and appeared to have acquired SARS nosocomially during admission. The remaining patient was a resident at Estate T and presented to hospital A with symptoms and signs of chest infection on April 8, 2003 and SARS was subsequently confirmed. Thus, it appeared that we have identified another cohort of patients harboring the SARS-CoV variant with the 386-nt deletion. It is interesting to note that this study provided additional anecdotal evidence pointing to Estate T as a propagation site for the deletion variant. In addition, we were able to trace the emergence of this deletion variant to early April 2003, weeks before the first appearance reported previously [9].Results and discussionOur study has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using allelic discrimination assays as a method for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV genotypes in patients. It is particularly useful when there is already extensive sequence information. Direct sequencing is still the gold standard for identifying new sequence variations when new agents of infectious disease continue to emerge and old ones reemerge. Once the variations have been identified, allelic discrimination assay is more efficient and suitable for large-scale population investigations. A recent study illustrated the use of mass spectrometry-based technology in characterizing SARS sequence variations [14]. However, this method requires post-PCR manipulations and the availability of specialized equipment. On the other hand, allelic discrimination assays have been widely used in the study of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and diseases such as cancers [15] and rheumatoid arthritis [16]. The validity of the approach for single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping has been previously demonstrated [17-19]. Thus, this study further extended the usefulness of allelic discrimination approach based on fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes. The approach provides a rapid and simple means to accurate genotype screening, making it ideal for epidemiological investigations.ConclusionWe have evaluated a rapid approach for characterizing SARS-CoV genotypes. The assay is simple, easy to perform and reproducible. It can therefore be used as an efficient means to screen for virus genotypes and track the transmission of a particular viral strain in times of epidemics. Incidentally, we identified a previously reported deletion variant of the SARS-CoV in a new cohort of patients and traced the emergence of this variant to an earlier date than previously reported.List of abbreviationsSARS: Severe acute respiratory syndromeList of abbreviationsSARS-CoV: SARS-coronavirusList of abbreviationsRT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionList of abbreviationsSNV: single nucleotide variationCompeting interestsYMDL, RWKC and SSCC have filed patent applications on aspects concerning the genomics and detection of the SARS-coronavirus.Authors' contributionsGTYC, RWKC and YMDL have contributed in the preparation of the manuscript and the overall study design.

An analysis of the feasibility of short read sequencing,"Several methods for ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing are currently under investigation (1–5). Many of these methods yield very short blocks of sequence information (reads), with some proposed methods giving reads as small as 16 nt. To be useful, these reads must be long enough to provide sufficient information to unambiguously place them on a known template sequence, or to generate unambiguous overlaps to reconstruct the sequence if no template is available. In both these processes repeats cause significant problems. Here we report on an analysis showing the level of genome sequencing possible as a function of read length. We show that re-sequencing and de novo sequencing of the majority of a bacterial genome is possible with read lengths of 20–30 nt, and that reads of 50 nt can provide reconstructed contigs of 1000 nt and greater that cover 80% of human chromosome 1.INTRODUCTIONThe leading methods for ultra high-throughput DNA sequencing fall into two main categories; sequencing by hybridization (6) and sequencing by synthesis (5,7–11). Sequencing by hybridization is an extension of well established DNA microarray techniques that essentially aim to identify all subsequences of a specific length within a genome via their hybridization to presynthesized probes. Sequencing by synthesis utilizes a process by which nucleotides are added in a controlled fashion to isolate DNA templates. Each nucleotide is read in turn; each base being added and then read in a cyclic process. Both of these approaches produce sequence information in very short segments compared to conventional Sanger sequencing. For sequencing by hybridization the length of each fragment of sequence information (the ‘read length’) is limited by the length of the probe. Probes cannot be extended much beyond 30 nt as the selectivity for perfect matches over single mismatches drops to unacceptable levels (12). In the case of sequencing by synthesis obtainable read length is proportional to cycle efficiency. However the technical challenges involved in this approach mean that the length of useful sequence that can be obtained is limited. Solexa Ltd, have recently claimed reads of 25 nt with sufficient throughput to re-sequence the viral genome of φ X174 (). Another promising technique is the high throughput pyrosequencing approach of 454 Life Sciences who are currently reporting read lengths of ∼100 nt (13).INTRODUCTIONA key problem for these sequencing methodologies is that as the length of each individual read decreases, the probability that a read will occur more than once in the sequence increases. The problems that repetitions can cause for sequencing projects based on whole genome shotgun approaches, where the read length is as short as 500 nt, have recently been analysed in detail (14). There has been much debate concerning the minimum length of read required to generate useful sequence information (3). However, despite the importance of this analysis for the utility of many proposed ultra high-throughput sequencing methods, little work has been reported on the analysis or reassembly of sequence information from very short reads. Perhaps the most significant contribution to this area has been that of Chaisson et al. (15) who discusses the limitations of short read sequencing with read lengths starting at 70 nt, the largest genome analysed (Neisseria meningitidis) is ∼2 Mb. In contrast to this, here we describe an analysis for read lengths between 18 and 200 nt, and extend our analysis to the whole human genome. Also rather than showing the result of a particular reassembly tool, our analysis describes the absolute limits of sequence data that can be reassembled.INTRODUCTIONIn a sequencing project based on short reads, repeated sections of the genome will cause several types of problems. If re-sequencing uses a known template sequence, repetitions will prevent an unambiguous assignment of reads to a single position on the template (16). Therefore the uniqueness of reads within the genome will be a key factor in determining how successful such re-sequencing can be. However, if the aim is de novo sequencing, a different problem is encountered. In this case repetitions will cause significant problems for assembly of contigs and will severely limit the amount of the sequence that can be effectively reconstructed.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe analysis shown in this paper was generated using the RepAnalyse (17) sequence analysis tool which we have developed for this purpose. RepAnalyse uses linear time suffix (18) and LCP (19) array construction algorithms. The uniqueness analysis and simulated reassembly are performed by analysing this suffix array. A technical report (17) for RepAnalyse is available on our website () or from the corresponding author. Details of the analysis methods and other applications will be reported elsewhere. Using the algorithms developed for RepAnalyse to process the suffix array we are able to produce the analysis shown far faster than with traditional techniques. Processing the whole human genome uniqueness analysis, required the construction of a full human genome suffix array for both forward and reverse strands, a total of 6.1 × 109 symbols. The analysis took two days and 70 Gb of RAM on a 1.6 GHz Itanium2 Processor.Uniqueness ::: RESULTSWe first focused on the simple issue of what percentage of all sequences are unique within a series of model genomes. This uniqueness measure is directly linked to the effect of read length on re-sequencing, where sequence information is assembled on a known template. In its simplest form, re-sequencing requires that a probe is uniquely identifiable with a single location on the template sequence.Uniqueness ::: RESULTSTo evaluate the feasibility of sequencing using a template we calculated the percentage of unique reads within a given genome using suffix array (20) derived analysis (17). We consider all possible reads of length l in the genome. Each read is compared with every other read of the same length and all reads that occur only once are counted. The uniqueness for read length l is then given by Ul = nu,l/np,l, where nu,l and np,l are the number of unique and possible reads, respectively. We have analysed the uniqueness of reads of all lengths in several model genomes. In Figure 1 we show two representative examples, a viral genome; λ-phage (GenBank accession no. NC_001416 size: 48 kb) and a bacterial genome, Escherichia coli (K12 MG1655, accession no. NC_000913 size: 4.6 Mb). In both cases uniqueness has an approximately sigmoidal dependence on read length. This closely follows the behaviour of randomly generated sequences of the same size. The position of the rise in the E.coli genome is at higher read length, largely due to the increased sequence length and therefore higher probability that any given sub-sequence will repeat. The most pronounced difference between the data for E.coli and λ-phage is that uniqueness in the bacterial genome reaches a plateau at around 97% from where the value then rises only very slowly. For instance while 97% of 18 nt reads are unique, a read length of 475 nt is required for 99% of reads to be unique. This plateau is a result of repeated segments such as the seven copies of the genes that code for ribosomal proteins and RNA and frequently repeated intergenic sequences such as Intergenic Repeat Unit (IRUs) and Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERICs) (21). Our analysis of the whole human genome shows a similar pattern, with a plateau being reached at a higher read length (Figure 2a).Reassembly ::: RESULTSRe-sequencing applications require that there is a known template sequence of sufficient quality to provide a map on which reads can be placed. In the case of de novo sequencing, such as the sequencing of a new organism, this map is not available. In the extreme case where no map information is available it is necessary to assemble these reads into contigs without the aid of any external information.Reassembly ::: RESULTSAs more complete genome sequences become available the quality of map information will increase. However it is not currently clear how reliable much of this information is, nor how best to apply it to the problem of reassembly from very short reads. We have therefore restricted our analysis to reassemble with no additional mapping information. In this analysis we use a suffix array to examine all possible fragments of a given size and use this information to predict which contigs could be assembled.Reassembly ::: RESULTSFor two reads to be reconstructed into a single contig, an unambiguous overlap between them is needed, i.e. there must not be two or more potential reads that would extend a contig differently. It is obviously possible to reassemble sequences where all potential overlaps are unique. It is also possible to reconstruct contigs from sections of DNA that have two or more identical repeats elsewhere in the genome. However it is not possible to extend the contig beyond the point where the repeats diverge. For example if there are two identical copies of a gene in the genome which differ only in the downstream non-coding sequence then it is possible to build a contig that contains the gene but this will be broken at the point where the downstream sequences differ. The gene would be reconstructed, but its location would be ambiguous.Reassembly ::: RESULTSFigure 3 shows how the percentage of the E.coli genome covered by contigs greater than a given length is affected by read length and Figure 2b shows the analysis for human chromosome 1.Viral sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONFor the very short genome of λ-phage reads of 12 nt are 98% unique. Therefore re-sequencing of this genome should be straightforward given a complete and error free read set. Re-sequencing by hybridization using probes of around 25 nt is now a reasonably well established technology and has been reported for the SARS Coronavirus (22). Other viral genomes we have analysed show similar trends (data not shown). As the genome is very short and contains very few repeats it is also possible to reassemble the genome of λ-phage phage from short reads. Our analysis shows that it is possible to completely reassemble the genome from 18 nt reads and that 17 nt reads can cover 99.6% of the genome with contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Below this read length, coverage falls dramatically. This confirms and extends the result of Chaisson et al. (15) where it was found that a read length of 70 nt would allow a viral genome (Adenovirus 35 kb accession no. AF394196) to be completely reassembled. And indicates that de novo sequencing of genomes of viral size should be well within the limitations of short read methods. The results on de novo sequencing show that, in principle at least, it is possible to sequence these genomes without any prior knowledge. However, highly repetitive elements can be found in specific viral genomes which will increase the read length required in these cases. It should also be noted that when sequencing a viral population it will not be possible to determine individual genome variability without first isolating that individual sequence.Bacterial and small eukaryote sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONThe uniqueness and reassembly analysis of the bacterial genome of E.coli K12 MG1655 show one main difference to that of both the viral genome and randomly generated sequences. While 97% of the genome can be unambiguously probed by reads of 17 nt (Figure 1b) the remaining 3% is ambiguous for much longer read lengths. This difference between the bacterial and viral genome sequences is a result of much more repetition of both large (kilobases) and small (20–200 nt) sequences in the E.coli sequence. The plateau in E.coli uniqueness suggests that, for bacterial genomes, once a threshold read length has been reached (≈ 17 nt for E.coli) further increases in read length will not provide a significant increase in the quality of information. This indicates that for bacterial genomes, methodologies that can provide reads of 18 nt or more are adequate for re-sequencing. However, it is important to note that specific bacterial genomes may contain highly repetitive elements which will increase the required read length. Sequencing by hybridization and other high-throughput methods can provide this information so the expansion of existing methods for re-sequencing viral genomes will provide sufficient data for re-sequencing most of a given bacterial genome.Bacterial and small eukaryote sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONAnalysis of the reassembly of the E.coli genome show that with a read length of 20 nt, over 98% of the genome can be re-assembled into contigs larger than 100 nt, and 91% into contigs larger than 1000 nt. However, only 10% is covered by contigs larger than 10 000 nt. At this read length over 75% of genes are entirely covered by a single contig. A read length of 30 nt improves the coverage for 10 000 nt contigs significantly to 75%, with over 96% of genes entirely covered by a single contig, this rises to 90 and 98%, respectively at a 50 nt read length. De novo sequencing of 90–97% of the E.coli genome into gene-sized contigs is therefore possible with reads of around 50 nt and a significant portion can be reconstructed with much shorter read lengths. This compares well with the result of Chaisson et al. (15) where it was found that a 70 nt read length would allow 93.4 and 99.5% of bacterial genomes (Campylobacter jejuni, 1.6 Mb and N meningitidis, 2.1 Mb accession nos: CJ11168X1 and NMA1Z2491) to be reconstructed into contigs of 1000 nt and greater.Bacterial and small eukaryote sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONOur analysis of the Caennorhabitis elegans genome (97 Mb, Figure 4b) showed that in a predicted reassembly from 50 nt reads 88% of the sequence is covered by contigs larger than 1000 nt and 51% is covered by contigs larger than 10 000 nt. By a read length of 100 nt a significant percentage (8.4%) of the genome is covered by contigs larger than 100 000 nt. This indicates that the whole genome shotgun sequencing of small eukaryotes is within the limitations of short read sequencing.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONThe ultimate goal for all high-throughput sequencing technologies is to enable affordable human genome sequencing. The human genome is much larger and much more repetitive than that of E.coli and therefore the challenges for short read sequencing approaches are expected to be much greater.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONThis is immediately evident when analysing uniqueness as a function of read length for the whole human genome (Build 35.1 size: 3 × 109 nt). Our uniqueness analysis for the whole human genome is shown in Figure 2a. This result compares well with the estimation of Shendure et al. (1) where they state that reads of ≈ 60 nt will be required for 95% uniqueness.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONWhile the overall shape of the curve is similar to that for E.coli the rate of increase after the plateau is reached is much slower. Read lengths of 25 nt would in principle be able to probe 80% of the genome, however read lengths of at least 43 nt are required to cover 90% of the genome.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONSuch a length is beyond the reach of sequencing by hybridization as selectivity for single mismatches will not be possible (12). Single molecule (23) and sequencing by synthesis approaches currently claim read lengths of 25 to 115 nt and therefore the application of the techniques to whole human genome re-sequencing shows promise.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONThe largest re-sequencing project reported for the human genome focussed on the non-repetitive sequences within chromosome 21, one of the smallest of the human autosomes. This allows the problem to be reduced to a series of smaller tasks both in terms of isolating a smaller section of the genome and the computational problems that are encountered. By reducing the size of the problem and focussing on regions that are not repeated it was possible to gain high quality sequence information for ∼65% of the 21.7 Mb under study using just over three billion 25 nt oligonucleotide probes(24).Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONOur whole human genome uniqueness analysis shows that relatively large (25 to 50 nt) read lengths will be required for a significant percentage of sub-sequences to be unique making re-sequencing difficult. Uniqueness also places an absolute limit on the read length required for de novo reassembly. As these results suggest that de novo reassembly of the whole genome is likely to be difficult and due to the amount of computation time required to process a whole human genome reassembly analysis we also elected to reduce the problem to single chromosomes.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONFor the 246 Mb of chromosome 1, the largest human chromosome, the uniqueness analysis (Figure 2a) shows a rise reaching 50% uniqueness with 16 nt reads, 2 nt fewer than for the full genome. Uniqueness also plateaus earlier and continues to rise faster with reads of 20 nt able to probe 80% of the chromosome and 35 nt required for 90% coverage. Other human chromosomes we have analysed show a similar pattern (data not shown) where the rate of increase after the plateau has been reached being dependent on the size of the chromosome.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONFigure 2b shows the analysis of a simulated reassembly of a complete set of reads obtained from chromosome 1. The analysis shows that with reads of 50 nt it is possible to reassemble 80% of the chromosome into contigs larger than 1000 nt; 17% is covered by contigs larger than 10 000 nt. Even with relatively modest read lengths of 25–30 nt significant proportions of chromosome 1 can be reassembled into contigs of 1000 to 10 000 nt. With a 500 nt read length 98.4% of the chromosome maybe reassembled into contigs larger than 10 000 nt.Human genome sequencing ::: DISCUSSIONFigure 5 gives an example of how contigs obtained by reassembling reads from a single chromosome cover a region of interest in the human genome. The reassembly of contigs from a complete set of 25, 50 and 100 nt reads of chromosome 17 was simulated. Figure 5 shows how these contigs cover the BRCA1 (25) gene, implicated in susceptibility to breast cancer. As can be seen the majority of exons are covered at a 50 nt read length, while 25 nt produces significantly less coverage. Using a 100 nt read length, two contigs are constructed which cover all of the exons in this gene. While contigs assembled from 50 nt reads cover the majority of the gene they cannot be positioned without additional information. However the fact that 87.5% of exons are covered by contigs of 200 nt or larger suggests that by using mapping information it should be possible to reconstruct the majority of the coding sequences in the genome. The efficient use of mapping information [such as matepair sequence data used to build ‘scaffolds’ by the Celera assembler (26)] is therefore an important area for future investigation.CONCLUSIONOur analysis links the frequency analysis of repeated regions to the problem of genome sequence reassembly from short read information. We have defined the limits on the amount of unambiguous sequence that can be obtained with a given read length for a range of model genome sequences. Re-sequencing and de novo sequencing of viral genomes should be straightforward with read lengths of 18–25 nt depending on the length of the genome, and the number and length of repetitive regions. For the re-sequencing of bacterial genomes, once a threshold read length is reached, increasing the read length yields only small gains. De novo sequencing of a large proportion of the E.coli genome is possible with read lengths of 20–50 nt. In the case of the much larger and more repetitive human genome sequence whole genome re-sequencing will be limited with current proposed technology. However partitioning the problem, by focussing on single chromosomes or by neglecting the more difficult and repetitive parts of the genome, makes the problem more tractable.CONCLUSIONAs the analysis reported assumes a perfect data set these results represent the upper bounds of what information can be obtained by short read sequencing. The effect of random and systematic errors will be to reduce the amount of sequence information that can be obtained from reads of a given length. Specifically, erroronious reads may result in incorrect sequence data, breaks within contigs and contig mis-assembly. The challenge for the future is to identify in detail the effect of different potential experimental errors and to work to eliminate those that have the most detrimental effect on data quality so as to approach the upper bounds identified here. Our key finding is that with high quality data and currently available read lengths significant amounts of useful data can be obtained both by using a template sequence and for de novo sequencing. Thus, while there are distinct limits on the completeness of the sequence information it is possible to obtain, short read sequencing has the potential to provide useful sequence information on large proportions of the genome for a range of model organisms cheaply and rapidly."
An ontology for immune epitopes: application to the design of a broad scope database of immune reactivities,"An epitope can be defined as the molecular structure recognized by the products of immune responses. According to this definition, epitopes are the specific molecular entities engaged in binding to antibody molecules or specific T cell receptors. An extended definition also includes the specific molecules binding in the peptide binding sites of MHC receptors. We have previously described [1] the general design of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), a broad program recently initiated by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The overall goal of the IEDB is to catalog and organize a large body of information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens and other sources [2]. Priority will be placed on NIAID Category A-C pathogens () and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Epitopes of human and non-human primates, rodents, and other species for which detailed information is available will be included. It is envisioned that this new effort will catalyze the development of new methods to predict and model immune responses, will aid in the discovery and development of new vaccines and diagnostics, and will assist in basic immunological investigations.BackgroundThe IEDB will catalog structural and phylogenetic information about epitopes, information about their capacity to bind to specific receptors (i.e. MHC, TCR, BCR, Antibodies), as well as the type of immune response observed following engagement of the receptors (RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-03/31: ).BackgroundIn broad terms, the database will contain two general categories of data and information associated with immune epitopes – intrinsic and extrinsic (context-dependent data). Intrinsic features of an epitope are those characteristics that can be unequivocally defined and are specified within the epitope sequence/structure itself. Examples of intrinsic features are the epitope's sequence, structural features, and binding interactions with other immune system molecules. To describe an immune response associated with a specific epitope, context information also needs to be taken into account. Contextual information includes, for example, the species of the host, the route and dose of immunization, the health status and genetic makeup of the host, and the presence of adjuvants. In this respect, the IEDB project transcends the strict boundaries of database development and reaches into a systems biology application, attempting for the first time to integrate structural information about epitopes with comprehensive details describing their complex interaction with the immune system of the host, be it an infected organism or a vaccine recipient [1-3].BackgroundFor these reasons, it was apparent at the outset of the project that it was crucial to develop a rigorous conceptual framework to represent the knowledge related to the epitopes. Such a framework was key to sharing information and ideas among developers, scientists, and potential users, and to allowing the design of an effective logical structure of the database itself. Accordingly, we decided to develop a formal ontology. Over the years, the term ""ontology"" has been defined and utilized in many ways by the knowledge engineering community [4]. We will adopt the definition of ""ontology"" as ""the explicit formal specifications of the terms in a domain and the relationships among them"" [5]. According to Noy and McGuinness [6], ""ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain and helps separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge"". Thus, availability of a formal ontology is relevant in designing a database, in cataloging the information, in communicating the database structure to researchers, developers and users, and in integrating multiple database schema designs and applications.BackgroundSeveral existing databases catalog epitope related data. We gratefully acknowledge that we have been able use these previous experiences in the design and implementation of the IEDB. MHCPEP [7], SYFPEITHI [8], FIMM [9], HLA Ligand Database [10], HIV Immunology Database [11], JenPep [12], AntiJen [13], and MHCBN [14] are all publicly available epitope related databases. In general, these databases provide information relating to epitopes, but do not catalog in-depth information relating to their interactions with the host's immune system. It should also be noted that none of these databases has published a formal ontology, but all of them rely on informal or implicit ontologies. We have taken into account as much as possible these ontologies, inferring their structure by informal communications with database developers or perusal of the databases websites.BackgroundThe ontology developed for IEDB and described herein complements two explicit ontologies that are presently available: the IMGT-Ontology and the Gene Ontology (GO). The IMGT-Ontology [15] was created for the international ImMunoGeneTics Database (IMGT), which is an integrated database specializing in antigen receptors (immunoglobulin and T Cell receptors) and MHC molecules of all vertebrate species. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first ontology in the domain of immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. The GO project [16] provides structured, controlled vocabularies that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology. GO provides an excellent framework for genes, gene products, and their sequences, but it does not address the specific epitope substructure of the gene products. The IMGT provides an excellent ontological framework for the immune receptors but lacks information relating to the epitopes themselves. Therefore it was necessary to expand the available ontologies and to create an ontology specifically designed to represent the information of immune receptor interaction with immune epitopes. Wherever possible, the IEDB ontology conforms to standard vocabularies for capturing values for certain fields. For capturing disease names, IEDB uses the International Classification for Diseases (ICD-10) [17]. The NCBI Taxonomy database nomenclature [18,19] is used to capture species and strain names, and HLA Allele names are consistent with the HLA nomenclature reports [20].The IEDB Ontology: Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source, and Assay Information classes ::: Construction and ContentOur approach for creating the class hierarchy was a top-down development process where we defined each class in a domain and then identified its properties before building the hierarchy. The main classes identified for IEDB are Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source, MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response (Figure 1). The Epitope class is the main class that encompasses all the individual concepts that were identified. The individual concepts are related to other classes. The primary relationships use the sub-class relationship or use a property (shown in the figures by the arcs labeled ""has"") that has a restriction on the type of the value that may fill that slot.The IEDB Ontology: Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source, and Assay Information classes ::: Construction and Content""Reference"" is the class encompassing information related to the data source from which an epitope and its related information are extracted into the IEDB. We have identified three broad subclasses of References that describe where epitope information will be obtained. They are Journal Article, Patent Application, and Direct Submission. The complete listing of slots (fields) encompassed by the Journal Article, Patent Application, and Submission classes are provided in Figure 2. The Journal Article class refers to manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals. The Patent Application class captures all the reference fields for a patent application that contain epitope information. The Submission class captures information about sources that contribute data to the IEDB directly. Data deposited by the Large Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery contracts [3] and those transferred from other websites fall into this class.The IEDB Ontology: Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source, and Assay Information classes ::: Construction and ContentThe Epitope Structure and Epitope Source classes capture intrinsic features of an epitope. The Epitope Structure class captures the physical and chemical features of an epitope. Virtually any molecular structure may provoke an immune response, such as proteins, carbohydrates, DNA, and lipids. In the Epitope Structure class, structural information relating to linear sequences and 2-D structures of the epitope, if available, are catalogued. The Epitope Source class captures the phylogenetic source of an epitope, including species of origin, gene name, protein name, and links to other databases for more detailed information about proteins and genes. Figures 3A and 3B show the listings of properties (slots/fields) encompassing the Epitope Structure and Epitope Source classes.The IEDB Ontology: Reference, Epitope Structure, Epitope Source, and Assay Information classes ::: Construction and ContentThe experimental data and information about specific experiments and the methodology utilized are captured in the Assay Information class. The name of the assay used, the type of response measured in the assay, and the readout of the assay are examples of information captured in the Assay Information class. This important class is used as a superclass of several other classes (and thus its properties are inherited by those classes). A complete listing the properties (slots/fields) in the Assay Information class is shown in Figure 3C.Immunization, Antigen, and Antigen Presenting Cell classes ::: Construction and ContentAs with Assay Information, the classes Immunization, Antigen, and Antigen Presenting Cell are used in multiple other class descriptions. Features relating to the induction of the immune response are captured in the Immunization class (Figure 4A). It has relationships to other classes like Immunized Species, Immunogen, In vivo Immunization, and In vitro Immunization. Immunized Species contains information relating to the host that is being immunized. The Immunogen class describes the molecules that induce the immune response and an associated carrier molecule, if present. Features relating to how the immunogen was introduced to the immunized species are captured under the In vivo and In vitro Immunization classes.Immunization, Antigen, and Antigen Presenting Cell classes ::: Construction and ContentSimilarly, antigens are defined as the whole molecules that react with the products of an immune response (as opposed to the epitopes which are the specific structures, contained within the antigen that engages the immune receptor). Information relating to the antigen and any associated carrier molecule is captured in the Antigen class (Figure 4B). During immune responses, antigen-presenting cells process antigens and present peptide epitopes complexed with MHC molecules. This information is captured in the Antigen Presenting Cells class, which has a relationship to the MHC Molecules and the Source Species classes (Figure 4C). The Source Species class describes the species information from which the antigen presenting cells are derived.The MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes ::: Construction and ContentThe MHC Binding class captures the details relating to the interaction of the epitope with specific MHC molecules and information relating to the MHC molecule along with any available Epitope-MHC complex structure details. This class also has a slot that is restricted to be an instance of the Assay Information class (Figure 5A).The MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes ::: Construction and ContentExtrinsic features of an epitope are captured by Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes. Extrinsic features are context-dependent attributes, being dependent upon specific experimental conditions. The Naturally Processed Ligand class captures data related to epitopes that are naturally processed and presented on the cell surface. This class has properties that are instances of classes including Antigen Presenting Cell, Antigen, and Assay Information (Figure 5B).The MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes ::: Construction and ContentThe Naturally Processed Ligand class differs from the MHC Binding class in that information related to the antigen that was processed and the cell types in which the processing occurred is represented. MHC Binding class captures data relating to in vitro MHC binding assays, which assess the epitope's binding capacity to the MHC molecule. Hence the MHC Binding class does requires neither the Antigen class not the Antigen Presenting Cells class. In general, naturally processed ligands are assessed in the absence of a T cell response, for example, identified by direct elution from MHC molecules extracted from infected cells or antigen presenting cells. Thus, the Immunization class is not used as a value restriction by the Naturally Processed Ligand class.The MHC Binding, Naturally Processed Ligand, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes ::: Construction and ContentThe T Cell Response class captures all of the T cell mediated immunity-related information (Figure 6A). It has properties that are of type: Immunization, Effector Cells, Antigen Presenting Cell, Antigen, Assay Information, and Epitope-MHC-TCR Complex. The Effector Cell class describes the cells that are elicited upon immunization and that acquire measurable functions as a result. The B Cell Response class describes antibody responses that are related to the epitope (Figure 6B). This class has properties that are of type: Immunization, Antibody Molecule, Antigen, Assay Information, and Antigen-Antibody Complex. Because B cell responses do not require MHC binding and antigen presenting cells, the respective classes related to MHC Molecule and Antigen Presenting Cells are not used as restrictions on properties of the B Cell Response class.Classes capturing 3D structures ::: Construction and ContentThere are three classes that capture information about the 3D structure of complexes: Epitope-MHC Complex, Epitope-MHC-TCR Complex, and Antigen-Antibody Complex. The Epitope-MHC Complex, Epitope-MHC-TCR Complex, and Antigen-Antibody Complex classes are used as restrictions on properties of the MHC Binding, T Cell Response, and B Cell Response classes respectively (Figures 5A, 6A, and 6B). These Complex classes capture the Protein Data Bank (PDB) Identifier, which provides detailed information about 3D structures. The Protein Data Bank [22,23] contains approximately 1600 3D structures that are of immunological interest. Other information that is not available in PDB, such as the atom pairs that are involved in the interactions between molecules, the specific residues, the contact area of the molecules, and allosteric effect, is also captured here.IEDB Class Hierarchy and Data Dictionary ::: Construction and ContentEach class has numerous slots that capture detailed information associated with epitopes. As mentioned above, a complete list of all the classes, their properties, and relationship, can be found at . One of the files provided as supplementary material contains two examples of how two literature references [24,25] containing epitope information are extracted into the IEDB ontology (additional file 1). Along with the class hierarchy, the IEDB's data dictionary (additional file 2) provides more detailed information about the fields that are defined for the IEDB. The data dictionary contains a textual overview description and a listing of fields that are required to be completed for IEDB entries. The data dictionary also allows database users to provide comments and suggestions to IEDB team to enhance the formal ontology.Utility and DiscussionThe IEDB will be a comprehensive resource pertaining to epitopes of the immune system. By extensively curating both intrinsic and extrinsic features associated with epitopes, the IEDB is expected to provide substantially greater detail about specific epitopes than any other databases presently available. The IEDB will be populated with data derived from three main sources, namely the peer-reviewed literature, patent applications, and direct submission. Epitope data published in the literature and patent applications are curated manually by the IEDB's curation team. Data from already existing epitope databases, whose authors have agreed to share their data, will also be imported into the IEDB. Apart from these, a main data source will be the direct submission of data from the Large-scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery programs [3] that are funded by NIAID. Presently, fourteen contracts have been awarded under this program, and all of them will submit their data to the IEDB. Direct antibody and T cell epitope submissions will also be sought from the broader research community, with an emphasis on antibody epitopes to NIAID Category A-C pathogens. Because of the large scale of the IEDB project, a formal ontology is critical to ensure consistency in the representation of data.Utility and DiscussionCommunication between database developers, researchers, analysis tool developers, and team members is crucial, and can be performed in harmony only when a common vocabulary is established. An ontology, which is an explicit formal specification of the terms in the domain and relationships among them, is an effective way to share the knowledge contained in that domain. Accordingly, since the IEDB's domain is epitope-related data, we have created an ontology that captures detailed conceptual structure related to these data.Utility and DiscussionThe development of this ontology has relevance for the expansion and modification of the epitope knowledge base. Our ontology design defines individual concepts as separate classes and then defined relationships between these classes and other objects in the domain. These classes serve to restrict the values that will describe properties of objects in the database. For example, the species is a separate concept defined in its own class. Depending on the context, this can refer to an immunized species or the species from which antigen presenting cells are derived. Similarly MHC Molecules is defined as a separate class, and it is used as a value restriction by concepts like MHC Binding and Antigen Presenting Cells. Defining concepts as separate classes and using them to restrict the values of properties in other classes facilitates the expansion and modification of our ontology. Adding properties (slots) to concepts is a task easily accomplished when there are well-defined class descriptions that may serve as value restrictions on the properties, and providing that these class descriptions are general enough to apply in all instances. We have ensured in our design that each concept is atomic and that it can be re-used by various classes.Utility and DiscussionThe development of a formal ontology is valuable to database users and in particular to scientists contributing data to, and downloading data from, the IEDB. We anticipate that the availability of a formal ontology will ensure that a common language and shared understanding of concepts will inspire this type of communication, thus ensuring maximum efficiency and accuracy. The formal ontology developed will most likely require refinement and fine tuning when users provide suggestions and new technologies for performing experiments are discovered. The IEDB website will provide mechanisms for the users to provide suggestions and participate in the enhancement of the ontology. The IEDB Data Dictionary has a separate column for the users to provide comments on specific data fields. The IEDB website will also host web forms that will guide users to conform to the ontology definitions when submitting data. Apart from the web forms, an XML schema definition (XSD) will be available on the website for users to inspect and use in their data submission. Users will also be able to download epitope records from the website.Utility and DiscussionIn the process of developing new ontologies, it is good practice to leverage existing community standards. In our initial analysis, we confirmed that there were no explicit ontologies that efficiently captured epitope details as per the scope of the IEDB program. As mentioned above, we have utilized, as much as possible, inferred ontologies from existing epitope databases. Among the ontologies that we analyzed, IMGT-Ontology and Gene Ontology were the only two formal ontologies that were related to the epitope domain. The IMGT-Ontology was designed for the ImMunoGeneTics database. IMGT is an integrated database specializing in antigen receptors (immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) and the major histocompatibility complex of all vertebrate species. The ontology developed for this database has specific immunological content, describing the classification and specification of terms needed for immunogenetics. The IEDB does conform to IMGT's standards about receptors and MHC molecule chains in the sense that all the chain names follow IMGT's controlled vocabulary.Utility and DiscussionGO provides structured controlled vocabularies for genes, gene products, and sequences annotated for many organisms. The IEDB complements GO in terms of epitopes of immunological interest since GO is incomplete in this area. Antigens, which are primary sources of epitopes, are annotated in GO. Thus, in essence, the IEDB could be utilized to provide an extension of GO for antigens that contain epitope-related information.ConclusionPerhaps the most important element in the development of the IEDB ontology is that, to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first immunological ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic biochemical and extrinsic context dependent information. In this respect, it is similar in spirit, but different in approach, from other knowledge resources relating to systems biology. We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases might lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses. Accordingly, this new program might represent a novel tool to assist in the design, testing, and development of new ways to combat infectious diseases and other immune related pathologies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.AvailabilityA complete listing of IEDB's class hierarchy and its properties is available at List of Abbreviations UsedIEDB – Immune Epitope Database and Analysis ResourceList of Abbreviations UsedMHC – Major Histocompatibility ComplexList of Abbreviations UsedTCR – T Cell ReceptorList of Abbreviations UsedBCR – B Cell ReceptorList of Abbreviations UsedIMGT – Immunogenetics DatabaseList of Abbreviations UsedGO – Gene OntologyList of Abbreviations UsedJ2EE – Java 2 Enterprise EditionList of Abbreviations UsedOWL – Ontology Web LanguageList of Abbreviations UsedPDB – Protein Data BankList of Abbreviations UsedNIAID – National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesList of Abbreviations UsedXML – Extensible Markup LanguageList of Abbreviations UsedXSD – XML Schema DefinitionAuthors' contributionsMS generated the formal ontology using Protégé.

Bench-to-bedside review: Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation in patients with acute lung injury,"Mechanical ventilation is indispensable for the survival of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, inappropriate ventilator settings may contribute to mortality by causing ventilator-induced lung injury. Tidal volumes greater than 10 ml/kg have been shown to increase mortality [1-5]. High static intrathoracic pressures may overdistend and/or overinflate parts of the lung that remain well aerated at zero end-inspiratory pressure [6-8]. Cyclic tidal recruitment and derecruitment experimentally produces bronchial damage and lung inflammation [9]. Although the clinical relevance of these experimental data has been challenged recently [10,11], the risk of mechanical ventilation-induced lung biotrauma supports the concept of optimizing lung recruitment during mechanical ventilation [12]. It has to be mentioned that the two principles aimed at reducing ventilator-induced lung injury may be associated with deleterious effects and require specific accompanying adjustments. Reducing the tidal volume below 10 ml/kg may increase the arterial partial pressure of CO2(PaCO2) and impair tidal recruitment [13]. Optimizing lung recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may require a recruitment manoeuvre [14] and the prevention of endotracheal suctioning-induced lung derecruitment [15]. This bench-to-bedside review presents the scientific rationale supporting the clinical use of adjuncts to mechanical ventilation aimed at optimizing lung recruitment and preventing the deleterious consequences of reduced tidal volume.Increase in respiratory rate ::: Adjuncts aimed at increasing CO&!start&2 &!end&eliminationIn patients with ARDS, increasing the ventilator respiratory rate is the simplest way to enhance CO2 elimination when tidal volume is reduced [5,16,17]. However, an uncontrolled increase in respiratory rate may generate intrinsic PEEP [18,19], which, in turn, may promote excessive intrathoracic pressure and lung overinflation [20]. If the inspiratory time is not decreased in proportion to the increase in respiratory rate, the resulting intrinsic PEEP may even cause right ventricular function to deteriorate [21]. In addition to inappropriate ventilator settings – high respiratory rate together with high inspiratory to expiratory ratio – airflow limitation caused by bronchial injury promotes air trapping [22,23]. Acting in the opposite direction, external PEEP reduces intrinsic PEEP and provides a more homogeneous alveolar recruitment [24,25], whereas lung stiffness tends to accelerate lung emptying [16,26]. As a consequence, in a given patient, it is impossible to predict intrinsic PEEP induced by a high respiratory rate and no 'magic number' can be recommended. At the bedside, the clinician should increase the ventilator respiratory rate while looking at the expiratory flow displayed on the screen of the ventilator: the highest 'safe respiratory rate' is the rate at which the end of the expiratory flow coincides with the beginning of the inspiratory phase (Fig. 1).Decrease in instrumental dead space ::: Adjuncts aimed at increasing CO&!start&2 &!end&eliminationWhen CO2 elimination is impaired by tidal volume reduction, the CO2-laden gas present at end expiration in the physiological dead space is readministered to the patient at the beginning of the following inspiration. The physiological dead space consists of three parts: first, the instrumental dead space, defined as the volume of the ventilator tubing between the Y piece and the distal tip of the endotracheal tube; second, the anatomical dead space, defined as the volume of the patient's tracheobronchial tree from the distal tip of the endotracheal tube; and third, the alveolar dead space, defined as the volume of ventilated and nonperfused lung units. Only the former can be substantially reduced by medical intervention. Prin and colleagues have reported that replacing the heat and moisture exchanger by a conventional heated humidifier positioned on the initial part of the inspiratory limb induces a 15% decrease PaCO2 in by reducing CO2 rebreathing [27] (Fig. 2). With a conventional humidifier, the temperature of the inspired gas should be increased at 40°C at the Y piece so as to reach 37°C at the distal tip of the endotracheal tube [27]. In sedated patients, the tubing connecting the Y piece to the proximal tip of the endotracheal tube can also be removed to decrease instrumental dead space [16]. For the same reason, if a capnograph is to be used, it should be positioned on the expiratory limb, before the Y piece. Richecoeur and colleagues have shown that optimizing mechanical ventilation by selecting the appropriate respiratory rate and minimizing instrumental dead space allows a 28% decrease in PaCO2 [16] (Fig. 2).Expiratory washout ::: Adjuncts aimed at increasing CO&!start&2 &!end&eliminationThe basic principle of expiratory washout is to replace, with afresh gas, the CO2-laden gas present at end expiration in theinstrumental dead space [28]. It is aimed at further reducing CO2 rebreathing and PaCO2 without increasing tidal volume[29]. In contrast to tracheal gas insufflation, in which the administration of a constant gas flow is continuous over the entire respiratory cycle, gas flow is limited to the expiratory phase during expiratory washout. Fresh gas is insufflated by a gas flow generator synchronized with the expiratory phase of the ventilator at flow rates of 8 to 15 L/min through an intratracheal catheter or, more conveniently, an endotracheal tube positioned 2 cm above the carina and incorporating an internal side port opening in the internal lumen 1 cm above the distal tip [16,29]. A flow sensor connected to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator gives the signal to interrupt the expiratory washout flow when inspiration starts. At catheter flow rates of more than 10 L/min, turbulence generated at the tip of the catheter enhances distal gas mixing, and a greater portion of the proximal anatomical dead space is flushed clear of CO2, permitting CO2 elimination to be optimized [30,31]. Expiratory washout can be applied either to decrease PaCO2 while maintaining tidal volume constant or to decrease tidal volume while keeping PaCO2 constant. In the former strategy, expiratory washout is used to protect pH, whereas in the latter it is used to minimize the stretch forces acting on the lung parenchyma, to minimize ventilator-associated lung injury.Expiratory washout ::: Adjuncts aimed at increasing CO&!start&2 &!end&eliminationTwo potential side effects should be taken into considerationif expiratory washout is used for optimizing CO2 elimination. Intrinsic PEEP is generated if the expiratory washout flow is not interrupted a few milliseconds before the beginning of the inspiratory phase [16,29]. As a consequence, inspiratory plateau airway pressure may increase inadvertently, exposing the patient to ventilator-induced lung injury. If expiratory washout is to be used clinically in the future, the software synchronizing the expiratory washout flow should give the possibility of starting and interrupting the flow at different points of the expiratory phase. A second critical issue conditioning the clinical use of expiratory washout is the adequate heating and humidification of the delivered washout gas.Expiratory washout ::: Adjuncts aimed at increasing CO&!start&2 &!end&eliminationCurrently, expiratory washout is still limited to experimental use. It is entering a phase in which overcoming obstacles to clinical implementation may lead to the development of commercial systems included in intensive-care-unit ventilators that may contribute to optimizing CO2 elimination [30], in particular in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with head trauma [32].Sighs and recruitment manoeuvres ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentPeriodic increases in inspiratory airway pressure may contribute to the optimization of alveolar recruitment in patients with ALI and ARDS. Sighs are characterized by intermittent increases in peak airway pressure, whereas recruitment manoeuvres are characterized by sustained increases in plateau airway pressures. The beneficial impact of sighs and recruitment manoeuvres on lung recruitment is based on the well-established principle that inspiratory pressures allowing reaeration of the injured lung are higher than the expiratory pressures at which lung aeration vanishes. At a given PEEP, the higher the pressure that is applied to the respiratory system during the preceding inspiration, the greater the lung aeration. In patients with ALI, the different pressure thresholds for lung aeration at inflation and deflation depend on the complex mechanisms regulating the removal of oedema fluid from alveoli and alveolar ducts [33,34], the reopening of bronchioles externally compressed by cardiac weight and abdominal pressure [35], and the preservation of surfactant properties.Sighs and recruitment manoeuvres ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentReaeration of the injured lung basically occurs during inspiration. The increase in airway pressure displaces the gas – liquid interface from alveolar ducts to alveolar spaces and increases the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the alveolar space and the pulmonary interstitium [36]. Under these conditions, liquid is rapidly removed from the alveolar space, thereby increasing alveolar compliance [37] and decreasing the threshold aeration pressure. Surfactant alteration, a hallmark of ALI, results from two different mechanisms: direct destruction resulting from alveolar injury, and indirect inactivation in the distal airways caused by a loss of aeration resulting from external lung compression [38]. By preventing expiratory bronchiole collapse, PEEP has been shown to prevent surfactant loss in the airways and avoid collapse of the surface film [38]. As a consequence, alveolar compliance increases and the pressure required for alveolar expansion decreases. The time scale for alveolar recruitment and derecruitment is within a few seconds [39,40], whereas the time required for fluid transfer from the alveolar space to the pulmonary interstitium is of the order of a few minutes [36]. It has been demonstrated that the beneficial effect of recruitment manoeuvres on lung recruitment can be obtained only when the high airway pressure (inspiratory or incremental PEEP) is applied over a sufficient period [41,42], probably preserving surfactant properties and increasing alveolar clearance [14].Sighs and recruitment manoeuvres ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentIn surfactant-depleted collapse-prone lungs, recruitment manoeuvres increase arterial oxygenation by boosting the ventilatory cycle onto the deflation limb of the pressure – volume curve [42]. However, in different experimental models of lung injury, recruitment manoeuvres do not provide similar beneficial effects [43]. In patients with ARDS, recruitment manoeuvres and sighs are effective in improving arterial oxygenation only at low PEEP and small tidal volumes [44,45]. When PEEP is optimized, recruitment manoeuvres are either poorly effective [46] or deleterious, inducing overinflation of the most compliant lung regions [47] and haemodynamic instability and worsening pulmonary shunt by redistributing pulmonary blood flow towards non-aerated lung regions [48]. However, after a recruitment manoeuvre, a sufficient PEEP level is required for preventing end-expiratory alveolar derecruitment [49]. Furthermore, recruitment manoeuvres are less effective when ALI/ARDS is due to pneumonia or haemorrhagic oedema [43].Sighs and recruitment manoeuvres ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentDifferent types of recruitment manoeuvre have been proposed for enhancing alveolar recruitment and improving arterial oxygenation in the presence of ALI [50]. A plateau inspiratory pressure can be maintained at 40 cmH2O for 40 s. Stepwise increases and decreases in PEEP can be performed while maintaining a constant plateau inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O [42]. Pressure-controlled ventilationusing high PEEP and a peak airway pressure of 45 cmH2O can be applied for 2 min [51]. The efficacy and haemodynamic side effects have been compared between three different recruitment manoeuvres in patients and animals with ARDS [49,51]. Pressure-controlled ventilation with high PEEP seems more effective in terms of oxygenation improvement, whereas a sustained inflation lasting 40 seconds seems more deleterious to cardiac output [49,51].Sighs and recruitment manoeuvres ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentStudies reporting the potential deleterious effects of recruitment manoeuvres on lung injury of regions remaining fully aerated are still lacking. As a consequence, the administration of recruitment manoeuvres should be restricted to individualized clinical decisions aimed at improving arterial oxygenation in patients remaining severely hypoxaemic. As an example, recruitment manoeuvres are quite efficient for rapidly reversing aeration loss resulting from endotracheal suctioning [52] or accidental disconnection from the ventilator. In patients with severe head injury, recruitment manoeuvres may cause cerebral haemodynamics to deteriorate [53]. As a consequence, careful monitoring of intracranial pressure should be provided in case of severe hypoxaemia requiring recruitment manoeuvres.Prone position ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentTurning the patient into the prone position restricts the expansion of the cephalic and parasternal lung regions and relieves the cardiac and abdominal compression exerted on the lower lobes. Prone positioning induces a more uniform distribution of gas and tissue along the sternovertebral and cephalocaudal axis by reducing the gas/tissue ratio of the parasternal and cephalic lung regions [54,55]. It reduces regional ventilation-to-perfusion mismatch, prevents the free expansion of anterior parts of the chest wall, promotes PEEP-induced alveolar recruitment [56], facilitates the drainage of bronchial secretions and potentiates the beneficial effect of recruitment manoeuvres [57], all factors that contribute to improving arterial oxygenation in most patients with early acute respiratory failure [55] and may reduce ventilator-induced lung overinflation.Prone position ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentIt is recommended that the ventilatory settings be optimized before the patient is turned into the prone position [35]. If arterial saturation remains below 90% at an inspiratory fraction of oxygen of at least 60% and after absolute contraindications such as burns, open wounds of the face or ventral body surface, recent thoracoabdominal surgical incisions, spinal instability, pelvic fractures, life-threatening circulatory shock and increased intracranial pressure have been ruled out [56], the patient should be turned to prone in accordance with a predefined written turning procedure [56]. The optimum duration of prone positioning remains uncertain. In clinical practice, the duration of pronation can be maintained for 6 to 12 hours daily and may be safely increased to 24 hours [58]. The number of pronations can be adapted to the observed changes in arterial oxygenation after supine repositioning [55]. Whether the abdomen should be suspended during the period of prone position is still debated [56]. Complications are facial oedema, pressure sores and accidental loss of the endotracheal tube, drains and central venous catheters. Despite its beneficial effects on arterial oxygenation, clinical trials have failed to show an increase in survival rate by prone positioning in patients with acute respiratory failure [59,60]. Whether it might reduce mortality and limit ventilator-associated pneumonia in the most severely hypoxaemic patients [59,60] requires additional study.Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentEndotracheal suctioning is routinely performed in patients with ALI/ARDS. A negative pressure is generated into the tracheobronchial tree for the removal of bronchial secretions from the distal airways. Two factors contribute to lung derecruitment during endotracheal suctioning: the disconnection of the endotracheal tube from the ventilator and the suctioning procedure itself. Many studies have shown that the sudden discontinuation of PEEP is the predominant factor causing lung derecruitment in patients with ALI [52,61]. During a suctioning procedure lasting 10 to 30 seconds, the high negative pressure generated into the airways further decreases lung volume [15]. A rapid and long-lasting decrease in arterial oxygenation invariably results from open endotracheal suctioning [62]. It is caused by a lung derecruitment-induced increase in pulmonary shunt and a reflex bronchoconstriction-induced increase in venous admixture; both factors increase the ventilation/perfusion ratio mismatch [52]. The decrease in arterial oxygenation is immediate and continues for more than 15 min despite the reestablishment of the initial positive end-expiratory level. A recruitment manoeuvre performed immediately after the reconnection of the patient to the ventilator allows a rapid recovery of end-expiratory lung volume and arterial oxygenation [62]. However, in the most severely hypoxaemic patients the open suctioning procedure itself may be associated with dangerous hypoxaemia [62].Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentClosed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is generally advocated for preventing arterial oxygenation impairment caused by ventilator disconnection [63,64]. However, a loss of lung volume may still be observed, resulting from the suctioning procedure itself and appearing dependent on the applied negative pressure [15,63]. Both experimental studies and clinical experience suggest that closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is less efficient than open endotracheal suctioning for removing tracheobronchial secretions [64,65]. As a consequence, the clinician is faced with two opposite goals: preventing lung derecruitment and ensuring the efficient removal of secretions [66]. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate an optimum method that takes both goals into account.Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentIn patients with ALI/ARDS, closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning should be considered the clinical standard. In severe ARDS, endotracheal suctioning should be optimized by pre-suction hyperoxygenation and followed by post-suction recruitment manoeuvres. In addition to the methods described above, two other types of recruitment manoeuvre have been proposed to prevent a loss of lung volume and reverse atelectasis resulting from endotracheal suctioning: the administration of triggered pressure-supported breaths at a peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O during suctioning [15] and the administration of 20 consecutive hyperinflations set at twice the baseline tidal volume immediately after suctioning [52].Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning ::: Adjuncts aimed at optimizing lung recruitmentThere is as yet no guideline for endotracheal suctioning in patients with severe ARDS. An algorithm is proposed in Fig. 3 aimed at preventing lung derecruitment and deterioration of gas exchange during endotracheal suctioning in hypox-aemic patients receiving mechanical ventilation with PEEP.ConclusionMechanical ventilation in patients with ALI/ARDS requires specific adjustments of tidal volume and PEEP. Clinical use of adjuncts to mechanical ventilation allows optimization of alveolar recruitment resulting from PEEP and prevention of deleterious consequences of reduced tidal volume. Appropriate increases in respiratory rate, replacement of heat and moisture exchanger by a conventional humidifier. administration of recruitment manoeuvre in case of accidental episode of derecruitment, prone positioning and closed-circuit endo-tracheal suctioning all contribute to optimization of arterial oxygenation and O2 eliminationAbbreviationsALI = acute lung injury; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; PaCO2 = arterial partial pressure of CO2; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."
Communication of bed allocation decisions in a critical care unit and accountability for reasonableness,"While there are consensus documents describing how decisions about ICU admission should be made and epidemiological data about the characteristics and outcomes of patients referred but refused admission [1,2] there is little information about this complex decision making process in the context of resource scarcity and unrelenting demand. Fairness in limit setting for admission to the intensive care unit can be evaluated using ""Accountability for Reasonableness"" (A4R). In the A4R framework, a fair process supplements moral deliberation based on substantive criteria and moral principles to guide resource allocation [3]. Priority setting in health care institutions is considered fair and legitimate if it satisfies four conditions (Table 1). When A4R was used to evaluate fairness of priority setting in two previous studies of intensive care units, deficiencies in the publicity and appeals conditions were observed [4]. The role of communication in the process of limit setting and its relationship with the publicity condition was highlighted in both studies, however a commentator noted ""an incomplete picture of the chain of evidence"" leading to the conclusion that there should be greater transparency to improve fairness [5].BackgroundWe sought to describe participants' perceptions of communication during the priority-setting process in the Critical Care Unit (CrCu) of Sunnybrook and Women's to gain an understanding of how the fairness of our bed allocation process might be improved.Design ::: MethodsQualitative case study research was used to describe priority setting at the microallocation level. This is the appropriate method for investigating a complex social phenomenon in its real life context [6].Setting ::: MethodsOur study was conducted at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science Centre in its busy critical care unit (CrCu). Beds in CrCu are available to Sunnybrook hospital programs; Surgical Oncology, Trauma, and Community. From the unit census, 1100 medical, trauma and surgical patients were admitted in 2001–2002. The median number of occupied beds at daily census in the critical care unit during the interview period (January – April 2003) was 18/18 with a median of 3 admissions and discharges per day.Sample ::: MethodsTheoretical sampling was used in choosing ""key"" participants and documents. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with people directly involved in microallocation in our critical care unit and we examined the content of three relevant hospital policies. We examined documents if interviewees made use of them to support decision-making. We included individuals who were recommended to us in previous interviews. For example, if an interviewee told us that resource nurses had a role in bed allocation, we interviewed resource nurses. The interviewees consisted of 3 critical care physicians, 4 clinical fellows in critical care, 4 resource nurses, 4 end-user physicians who commonly referred patients to the intensive care unit and 3 members of the administrative staff. We continued interviewing until we reached saturation; a point at which no new concepts or important actors in the process were identified in subsequent interviews.Sample ::: MethodsBed allocation in the critical care unit is specified by a policy ""Critical Care Directorate [CrCu] Resource Prioritisation"" which addresses the ICU needs of the following institutional programs; Trauma, Surgical Oncology and Community. This policy specifies priorities for intensive care unit admission as follows: 1.) Intramural patients; any program affiliation, including war veterans from an adjoining chronic care facility, 2.) Extramural trauma referrals [as long as one intensive care unit bed remains available] and surgical oncology patients (up to a maximum of 2 occupied intensive care unit beds per day), 3.)Extramural referrals including neurosurgical patients and other elective surgical patients requiring postoperative care in the intensive care unit. The critical care physician in charge is empowered by policy ""VI-A-10 Admission of Acute Care Patients: Section 6 – Admission to a Critical Care Unit. Priority of Admission to a Critical Care Unit"" as the sole participant making bed allocation decisions. Disputes or concerns about intensive care unit bed allocation decisions, such as their potential to compromise patient safety due to inadequate resources are arbitrated by the Medical Director on Call whose authority to over-rule decisions is established by policy ""Core Patient Care Policy: Patient Flow"".Data collection ::: MethodsInterviews consisted of open-ended questions related to priority setting and fairness of the decision-making process (Table 2). The interviewer asked further specific questions to clarify answers and focus the subject on the question that was asked. The interview was audio taped and then transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were read and analysed by two individuals (AJ, AC). Three policy documents that pertained to admissions and discharges from the ICU were identified and analysed.Data analysis ::: MethodsModified thematic analysis of the interviews and documents involved reading through the transcribed data and identifying concepts that related to how priority-setting decisions were made. Conceptually associated text was organised in Microsoft Excel© spreadsheets labelled with descriptive categories. We grouped data with similar concepts into overarching themes related to allocation decisions, and then sorted it according to the identified key participants We then extracted data describing the process of communication involving these participants, focussing on content and the communication methods used. Finally we used writing to formalise our interpretation of concepts emerging from the data, and to make our interpretations explicit.Ethics approval ::: MethodsThe study was reviewed and approval was granted by the research ethics committees of Sunnybrook and Women's and the University of Toronto. No patients were interviewed.Critical care physicians ::: ResultsCritical Care physicians communicated their decisions to the Medical Director On call (an administrator empowered by policy to adjudicate controversial decisions), Trauma Team Leader, Resource Nurse, Operating Room, Surgical House staff, and Surgeons. Most critical care physicians in our sample did not identify a need to communicate their decisions to families of patients cared for by end-users.Critical care physicians ::: ResultsDepending upon how full we are in the ICU I may need to communicate directly with the overhanging users of the ICU ... to say, sort of, ""the ICU is getting full,"" or, ""is full and we are really be hard [sic] to accept any more traumas,"" so they know not to accept if we can't care for patients. As well, the operating room, other than the surgeons to say, you know, ""this is how we're doing, we are not going to be able to accommodate the patient that was scheduled to come here.Critical care physicians ::: ResultsWhen communicating with end-users, Critical Care Physicians discussed reasons for being unable to agree to a request for an ICU bed. They included program-based prioritization, (e.g. surgical oncology would have precedence over surgical services not identified as high priority), lack of capacity, and anticipated or approaching lack of capacity. Some physicians communicated reasons for denying a bed directly to end-users, while others noted that they might communicate indirectly via house staff or by leaving a message with the receptionist at the operating room desk for the surgeon.Critical care physicians ::: Resultsif a surgeon has a patient booked, the OR desk and the operating room that the surgeon would be working in that day would be advised, it might not necessarily be the surgeon directly, the OR desk may say put room 1 on hold because we are not sure about the bed; but the message gets to the surgeon who has booked the case that wayCritical care physicians ::: ResultsCritical care physicians required direct communication of requests for beds. In harmony with the policy VI-A-10 Admission of Acute Care Patients: Section 6 – Admission to a Critical Care Unit. Priority of Admission to a Critical Care Unit they viewed this communication as a necessary condition for any end-user to access an ICU bed. Although required by policy, direct communication was often omitted in practice. The indirectness of communication between the critical care physician and end-users resulted in unofficial ""parallel tracks"" of allocation decision-making (see below and Fig. 1). The lack of direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users could result in each being unaware of the other's bed allocation decisions and rationales.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsWe use the term ""end-user physician"" to designate participants from any hospital program. Our end-user participants included physicians from medical and surgical services who sought access to the ICU resource on behalf of their patients. End-user physicians discussed ICU bed allocation decisions with critical care physicians, clinical fellows and house staff, the ICU resource nurse, the surgical oncology triage coordinator, bed care coordinators, extramural referring services, and patients or families. End-Users perceived the critical care fellow or resource nurse as good sources of information, but the availability of a bed could be better ascertained from a discussion with the resource nurse.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsI've found some fellows when I talk to them, they've been happy to make the decision on their own and that may reflect a discussion that they've already had with the attending. And other times the fellow will say, ""well this is something I need to clear with the attending. I think its ok but let me check and I'll get back to you."" So at times they act as a go between other times they make the decision and I don't know if that decision is one that's already made beforehand or they're at a senior enough level or comfortable enough to, you know, so it's variable.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsAt Sunnybrook and Women's, clinical fellows communicate with critical care physicians about proposed admissions to the units, but they are not permitted to allocate beds independently. Reflecting this, some end-users bypassed the clinical fellows completely and based their possibilities for access to available beds on discussion with the ICU resource nurse. One respondent perceived that this information was enough to allow a decision to be made to accept an extramural referral.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsOn the other hand if there are beds, you're given the situation when there's 6 beds, and then I don't really have to talk to anybody I just have to tell the resource nurse and they're happy usually to ""ok"" the decision.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsEnd users perceived that communication with the critical care physician would clarify rationales when patients were refused admission.""End user"" physicians ::: Resultshuman nature being what it is, if the answer to you is ""no you don't get a bed"" than usually you're going to ask why and usually they try to give you a bit of a rationale as to why you didn't get the bed and ""Sid Viscious "" got the bed.""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsHowever, they perceived that communication with the critical care physician was less than ideal. Critical care physicians could be vague about the status of bed availability.""End user"" physicians ::: Resultsthere's this frustration of, you don't get a straight answer, ""well maybe we have a bed,"" ""well when will you know?"" ""Well, give us an hour.""""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsThere was variability in the response of individual critical care physicians to families about the rationales for refusal of admission. Some end-users felt this was not inappropriate.""End user"" physicians ::: Resultswell hopefully, hopefully, they would communicate it to everyone involved. I think in practice its communicated with either the resident or the staff and may or may not discuss it with the family. the ICU doc has no previous relationship with the family member so it may be more appropriate for the primary care doc to go back to the family""End user"" physicians ::: ResultsWhen elective surgery requiring postoperative intensive care was affected by bed shortage, end-users identified a mediator; the Surgical Oncology Triage Co-ordinator who would intervene to decide which of two surgeries requesting the same bed would proceed.""End user"" physicians ::: Resultson a given day, the ICU may say to us, ""you know what, you're allowed 2 beds but we don't have 2 beds, we have one bed or we have zero beds,"" so then you have to fight with yourselves and what they do is say that the two surgeons who have beds will fight with themselves or there is a coordinator who has to decide and generally the ICU tries to keep itself out of that discussion.Resource nurse ::: ResultsThe resource nurse and critical care physician approve proposed admissions after considering their impact on physical and human resources in the intensive care unit.Resource nurse ::: ResultsIt's more the resource nurse and the doctors along with the bed flow person, really, because I get them involved, you know, you've gotta get them involved, because you've gotta know how your bed situation goes. So right of the bat, in the morning I call them, ""I've got three people to go out, how's the beds looking?""Resource nurse ::: ResultsThe central role of the resource nurse in ICU bed allocation is seen in the diversity of stakeholders with whom she must communicate; the critical care physician, critical care fellows, trauma team leader, operating room, referring services and patient flow specialist. Combined with end -user perceptions that the resource nurse could make bed allocation decisions, this resulted in the resource nurse assuming an unofficial (contrary to policy) role as the primary decision maker.Resource nurse ::: Resultsthe patient was gone to the OR and I took their bed and just hoped that they'd be in the OR for the same time as the other patient was going to organ procurement and this patient was coming back from the OR. That was, I didn't really go through anybody to make that decision.Resource nurse ::: Resultswe hear from an anaesthetist in the OR, ""we're having trouble, it doesn't look like this patient is going to be extubatable, is there a bed?"" If there isn't a bed we usually say ""can they go to recovery room, and then we'll assess them later?"" Or sometimes they say adamantly ""no, they have to come."" Then usually I just let the fellow or staff man know.Resource nurse ::: ResultsCommunication of bed allocation decisions was verbal, informal and typically occurred over the telephone. Resource nurses played a key role in identifying breaks in the flow of information that might exclude participants, such as the critical care physician from involvement in the decision making process.Resource nurse ::: ResultsBy phone and it starts with the resident or the fellow and it doesn't usually go straight to the staff. Usually. And sometimes they call me; they'll call the resource nurse looking to see if there is a bed or if there'll be bed.Resource nurse ::: ResultsFor priority hospital programs with special entitlement to ICU resources, communication of bed requests might be made with very little direct communication between the ICU participants and the progam's end-user physicians. This was especially true for the trauma program. Communication between the trauma program and the resource nurse mirrored the indirectness already described in communication between the critical care physician and end-users.Resource nurse ::: Resultstraumas usually make their way through the resource nurse and the resource nurse usually tells the fellow that there's a trauma on its route and that's how that one is communicated.Resource nurse ::: Resultsif it's a trauma patient it could be the ward clerk down in emerg who'll just call and tell us there's a trauma coming, like eta or whatever and if they're tubed or not. Usually when they tell us that they're tubed we just automatically say, ""well ok they're going to need to come to the ICU"".Clinical fellows ::: ResultsClinical fellows communicated ICU bed allocation decisions with team-members, including the critical care physician, resource nurse, on-call resident and bedside nurses. They also discussed decisions with stakeholders external to the ICU; referring services, patients and their families.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsI guess to start with, the people taking care of the patient wherever they are, so the nurse and the resident physician. I don't always talk to the staff directly. I don't often deliver it to the attending on the floor. The patient, the patient's family if they're available, if not maybe a little later on then the patient's family. The resource nurse in the ICU, the resident that I'm on call with, and eventually after the patient... the staff that's on call; once they're all monitored and everything.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsClinical fellows reviewed requests for ICU beds and their appropriateness (in relation to admission criteria) with referring services. Clinical fellows were the only participants who described discussing reasons for non-admission with patients or families when patients were deemed inappropriate for intensive care. However, not all clinical fellows we interviewed described doing this, and some respondents were uncomfortable with the practice.Clinical fellows ::: Resultswhen the ICU says, ""there is no role for ICU care here"", and the patient's family thinks that there is and in that situation first I would try talking to both the patient and the family.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsSaying to someone that well ""you're low priority as compared to another patient who's sick elsewhere,"" seems kind of wrong.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsDiscussion of referrals with critical care physicians was usually done directly. Clinical fellows described contacting referring service superiors if there was disagreement about their decisions not to admit a patient to the ICU. However, they commented on feeling left out of decisions made by other participants to allocate beds; fellows found that they needed to take the initiative to remain informed.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsIf my staff decides to bring somebody in the unit, they always tell the charge nurse and they usually tell me, they don't always tell the house staff. If the charge nurse decides to bring somebody into the unit they usually talk to the staff but they don't often inform the house staff or the fellow. So that's why, like when I first come in, in the morning, I go to the charge nurse and find out how many flow throughs we're having from the OR, cause otherwise you don't know how many beds you need to have empty and then I go to them, essentially, every 2 hours and say, ""are there any other patients you've heard of, are there any traumas in the wings, are there any criticall patients coming, is anything going wrong in the OR, cause they're the person who will have that information but they don't necessarily tell all the house staff.Clinical fellows ::: ResultsClinical fellows observed that communication of bed allocation decisions to end-user physicians and families of patients affected by them were without formal guidance. Clinical fellows, like end-users observed that the reasons for bed allocations were not always accessible.Clinical fellows ::: Resultsit happens when outside services really want somebody to come into the unit, I mean we've initially said no and their staff is more that welcome to call my staff and discuss it and come to some amicable agreement but usually at that stage the fellows and the house staff are usually out of the decision making processAdministrators: patient flow specialist ::: ResultsPatient flow specialists monitor resource availability (critical care and other beds) within the institution and communicate this to the critical care physician, end users and resource nurse.Administrators: patient flow specialist ::: Resultssometimes it is definitely a collaborative effort between all the different physicians and sometimes nursing input, often patient flow will be called to see, where the pressure points are ""can we do this, can we take another patient, can you get people out so that we can make this happen?""Administrators: patient flow specialist ::: ResultsWhen disagreements arise about interpretation of prioritization rules outlined by policy, the patient flow specialist is obligated by policy to communicate with the medical director on call. The role of the medical director was to direct physicians to decline transfers and to cancel or reprioritize surgery. This involvement was sought when the patient flow specialist was unable to convince those requesting a bed that the proposed ICU admission would be unsafe.Administrators: patient flow specialist ::: Resultsif there's a problem with someone doing something like... pulling someone into critical care or doing something extraneous to get people out of there which is going to impact the hospital or hurt someone. We can say ""no"" and we can pull a physician in to talk to them immediately.Administrators: patient flow specialist ::: ResultsPatient flow specialists' perceptions of the communication in bed allocation decision making included an appreciation of its complexity and urgency. Communication of these important decisions was ad hoc and lacked formal procedural guidance.Administrators: patient flow specialist ::: Resultsthere isn't any sort of formal mechanism that we must make sure on the tick sheet that this person contacts this person, this person, it just happens form a what makes sense point of view for the situation.DiscussionOur case study is the first to concentrate on the communication of critical care unit bed allocation decisions. We found a complex interaction between multiple participants in which information impacting on decisions to allocate beds was exchanged (Table 3, Figure 1). However, the methods of communication were often indirect, sometimes with complete breaks in the flow of information between key participants. Communication breaks often impacted those most directly affected by a decision not to allocate a bed, such as the end-user surgical oncologist or the families of patients requiring intensive care treatment. These results are important because they suggest ways to improve the publicity of limit setting decisions in critical care units.DiscussionIn a study of priority setting in a large university affiliated teaching hospital, Mielke et al found multiple participants in the decision making process [4]. Further to the key participants we identified, these investigators found members of the hospital medical advisory committee, legal counsel and bioethicists as participants. This finding may reflect differences in scope between our investigation and theirs; we did not extend our investigation to committee meetings. Arguments have previously been made for nurses to be advocates for care preferences and operational safety within the process of decision-making [7,8]. We found that key decision makers talked to the resource nurse during their evaluation of the availability of intensive care unit beds. The prominent involvement of some nursing personnel in critical care unit bed allocation is a unique finding of the present study. This implicit acknowledgement of the importance of the resource nurse in our intensive care unit contrasts with survey findings that nurses perceive their input is not valued [9]. The perception that a bed was available after discussion with the resource nurse was sufficient for some participants to make a commitment to admit their patients to the unit, even without further attempts to communicate with the official gatekeeper, the critical care physician.DiscussionAdding to the complexity of the process we studied were ""parallel tracks"" of decision-making. End-user physicians (neurosurgeons, operating room surgeons and anesthesiologists), the critical care unit resource nurse, and the most entitled service (trauma program) all identified circumstances in which they might make independent bed allocation decisions. This may explain why some end-user physicians experienced frustration in their attempts to access critical care unit resources. While official accountability for bed allocation decisions rested with the critical care physician, ""parallel track"" decision makers could allocate beds without this participant's knowledge. Previous investigators have demonstrated that parallel track decision makers may view the critical care unit physician as responsible for making decisions about the appropriateness of discharges, but may not consult with them about decisions to admit patients [10]. This exclusion from the decision making process may cause the official gatekeeper to be unable to explain why beds are not available in the critical care unit at a given time. When ICU beds are readily available, decision makers find it difficult to deny patient access to a bed- the "" non triage mode"". When there is a high census or full occupancy, decision makers must prioritize admissions to the ICU- ""triage mode"". Involvement of the ICU physician in triage mode involves reviewing and prioritizing proposed admissions and decision making about discharges of patients who can safely be discharged or transferred. Review of patients who are not responding or benefiting from continuing intensive care also occurs [11]. ""Parallel-track"" decision-making resulting in ICU bed allocation occurred in both modes in our case study. When ICU beds are readily available, parallel – track decision makers such as the resource nurse, clinical fellow or end user physicians might reasonably make bed allocation decisions based on ICU admission criteria, improving the responsiveness and flexibility of the resource. However, the importance of direct communication between parallel – track decision makers and the critical care physician – gatekeeper is not diminished because admissions in the ""non -triage"" mode increase the probability the unit will later enter "" triage"" mode conditions.DiscussionThe fairness of limit setting decisions in our critical care unit may have been adversely affected by indirect communication. Until recently, very little has been known about communication in this milieu. Mielke et al found that ICU physicians communicated their bed allocation decisions and the reasons for them primarily to end user (referring) physicians. However, we found that communication of bed allocation decisions in our critical care unit was sometimes conducted through intermediaries, such as fellows, residents or receptionists. The effectiveness of communication conducted in this way, especially in regard to families is limited because family members often feel they have not been given enough time and require extra explanations if spoken to by junior physicians such as residents [12]. We observed that reasons for denial of an ICU bed were not directly communicated directly to families, who might learn of the decision from the referring service, as did those in Mielke's case study. Communication failures (""botch ups"") were deemed the root cause of conflicts and appeals of decisions [4]. Bernstein et al also found that decisions and rationales were disseminated within the ICU and to end-users but not to patients, families or the public [10]. Families of critically ill patients may experience inadequate communication in close to half of their meetings with physicians, when these do occur. While there are many possible reasons, including the impact of anxiety and depression on family members' capacity to understand complex information about their loved one [13], physician related factors, such as meetings of short duration are also highlighted [14]. Even when surgical intensive care unit doctors do have meetings, they dominate the dialogue and utter more words per conversational turn than family members [15]. Within the critical care unit, the environment is noisy [16] and there are frequent disruptions by simultaneous events, which present problems not only for patients but also for researchers [17]. Our findings strengthen a chain of evidence showing how the publicity and appeals conditions of the leading fair process framework (accountability for reasonableness) may break down in critical care units [5]. They support recommendations that the publicity and appeals conditions can be improved by direct explanations of the reasons for admission to the intensive care unit and improved opportunities for debate about the appropriateness of bed allocation decisions.DiscussionOur case study methodology has some important limitations. Our choice of physician, nurse and administrative participants was guided by theoretical sampling. While this sampling method is systematic and non probabilistic, it identified initial participants comparable to those chose in previous investigations [4,10]. Although none of the participants we interviewed suggested that administrators should be included in the sample, their absence from our investigation limits our description because of the important mediation role some of them (such as the Medical Director on Call) played. We tried to ensure the validity of our analysis by giving interviewees transcripts of the analysis as it developed, but we did not do this systematically due to restrictions on health worker communication during the Toronto SARS epidemic [18]. Although this decreases the validity of our results, they are nonetheless congruent with other investigations in critical care units in ways we have already discussed. We continued to collect data until content ""saturation"" was encountered, but we did not interview family members of critically ill patients. This deliberate exclusion was felt to be justifiable because we were interested in how communication occurred between those who were officially responsible for decisions resulting in bed allocation in the critical care unit. However, the exclusion is unfortunate because it can be argued that family members represent an additional category of parallel track decision makers. For example, when disagreement over the appropriateness of life sustaining therapy occurs, our institutional policy mandates full treatment pending the outcome of a conflict resolution process. In effect this means that demands for critical care (even when judged medically inappropriate) from family members must be satisfied, even if for a short time by the allocation of a bed for the patient. Finally, our research setting in an urban, university affiliated teaching hospital may restrict the generalization of our results; communication in non-university teaching hospital contexts may involve participants who interact differently from those we observed.ConclusionA formal policy guideline for communication of 'parallel track' decision making to the resource nurse should be created to ensure that independent decisions can be safely integrated within the resource constraints of the institution. Next, communication of such important decisions should not be delegated to third party intermediaries (e.g. Receptionists, Junior Housestaff) lacking meaningful involvement in the process. To improve the fairness of process in our institution, direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users would begin to satisfy the publicity condition of accountability for reasonableness. This seems especially important in relation to communication with the families of incapable patients affected by critical care unit bed allocation decisions.Competing interestsAn earlier draft of this paper was awarded the 2003 K.J.R.

Proinflammatory cytokine responses induced by influenza A (H5N1) viruses in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells,"Influenza pandemics arise from genetic reassortment between avian and human influenza viruses or alternatively by the direct adaptation of a avian influenza viruses to efficient human-to-human transmission [1]. Avian influenza A subtype H5N1 transmitted from poultry to humans in Hong Kong in 1997 (H5N1/97) causing fatal human respiratory disease [2,3]. The subsequent re-emergence of human H5N1 disease in southern China [4], Vietnam [5], Thailand and Cambodia [6] has raised the specter of a new influenza pandemic. While human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 subtype influenza virus appears to be inefficient so far, the disease has exceptional severity in those affected with reported mortality rates ranging from 33% in Hong Kong in 1997 to 55% in Thailand and Vietnam in 2004. The reasons for this unusual severity of human disease have remained unclear.BackgroundWhile dissemination outside the respiratory tract was not demonstrated in human H5N1 disease in 1997 and 2003 [4,7], there is some evidence that more recent H5N1 viruses may occasionally disseminate to multiple organs contributing to unusual disease manifestations such as meningo-encephalitis [8]. However, most patients with H5N1 disease had a primary viral pneumonia complicated by the syndromes of acute respiratory distress and multiple organ dysfunction [4-7,9] with lymphopenia and haemophagocytosis being notable findings. The syndromes of acute respiratory distress and multiple organ dysfunction as well as haemophagocytosis have previously been associated with cytokine dysregulation [10,11].BackgroundInfluenza virus infection of blood-monocyte-derived murine and human [12,13] macrophages and porcine alveolar macrophages [14] have been shown to result in induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that, when compared to human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, infection of H5N1/97-like viruses lead to the hyper-induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human primary macrophage cultures in vitro [12]. We also reported that patients with H5N1 disease have unusually high serum concentrations of chemokines IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10) and MIG (monokine induced by interferon γ) [4]. We have therefore hypothesized that this differential hyper-induction of cytokines and chemokines may contribute to the unusual severity of human H5N1 disease [4,12].BackgroundWhile macrophages are a key sentinel cell of the immune system and are permissive to influenza virus replication, the primary target cell for the virus are respiratory epithelial cells [15]. In primates experimentally infected with H5N1/97 virus, the type I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages were found to contain viral antigen [16]. Virus infection of alveolar pneumocytes was also demonstrated in the lung of a patient with fatal H5N1 disease [17]. Human alveolar epithelial cells are vital for the maintenance of lung function and the pulmonary air-blood barrier. In addition, human respiratory epithelial cells respond to viral infections by mounting a cytokine response that contributes both to the innate and adaptive host defenses [18]. Furthermore, type II pneumocytes express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in vivo [19]. Expression of class II MHC is usually limited to specialized cells of the immune system whose role is to present foreign antigen to helper T cells [20,21]. The expression of these molecules on alveolar epithelial cells is likely to be of relevance to the adaptive immune response. Therefore it is important to study cytokine responses induced by infection of epithelial cells with influenza viruses including H5N1 viruses.BackgroundHuman influenza A viruses have been previously reported to induce interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) in vitro from the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line (NCI-H292) [18]. However, the physiological relevance of findings from transformed cell lines is uncertain and primary alveolar epithelial cell cultures would be a more relevant model [22]. Here, we have compared the cytokine profiles induced by H5N1/97 and H1N1 viruses in human primary type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro to test the hypothesis that H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses differentially hyper-induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in respiratory epithelial cells.Viruses ::: Materials and methodsAn influenza virus isolated from a patient with fatal influenza A H5N1 disease in Hong Kong in 1997, A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1/97), viruses from patients with H5N1 disease in Vietnam in 2004, A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both abbreviated as H5N1/04) and a human H1N1 virus A/Hong Kong/54/98 (H1N1) were studied. Viruses were initially isolated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. They were cloned by limiting dilution, and seed virus stocks were prepared in MDCK cells. Virus infectivity was assessed by titration of tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID50) in MDCK cells. The H5N1 influenza viruses used in this study were handled in a BL3 biocontainment facility.Cells ::: Materials and methodsPrimary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, Inc., Maryland, USA). NHBE cells were grown according to the suppliers instructions in serum-free and hormone supplemented bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM) which included supplements of 13 g/l bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 g/l hydrocortisone, 0.5 mg/l human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 g/l epinephrine, 10 g/l transferrin, 5 g/l insulin, 0.1 mg/l retinoic acid, 6.5 mg/l 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thryonine, 50 g/l gentamicin, and 50 mg/l amphotericin B (Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, Inc., Maryland, USA). Medium was changed daily starting from the day after seeding. Cells reached confluency in approximately 9 to 10 days, and nearly confluent cells were subcultured using trypsin/EDTA (Cambrex) at a ratio of 1:5. Experiments were carried out on the same batch of cells at passage 3 to 4. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37°C) under liquid-covered conditions.Cells ::: Materials and methodsPrimary human alveolar epithelial cells (type II pneumocytes) were isolated from human non-tumor lung tissue obtained from 13 patients (mean age 65 yr [range, 46–77 yr], 10 males and 3 females) undergoing lung resection in Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong. The research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Human type II pneumocytes were isolated using a modification of the methods previously described [19,23]. Briefly, after removing visible bronchi, the lung tissue was chopped into pieces of >0.5 mm thickness using a tissue chopper, washed with balanced salt solution (BSS, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37°C three times to partially remove macrophages and blood cells. The tissue was digested using a combination of trypsin (0.5%, GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and elastase (2 units/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) twice for 15 min at 37°C in a shaking water-bath. The partially digested tissue was minced in the presence of 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM/F12 medium and DNase I (350 units/ml) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and cell clumps dispersed by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension for 10 minutes. After filtration through gauze and a 40 μm cell strainer to ensure a single cell suspension, the cells were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 medium and small airway growth medium (SAGM, Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Maryland, USA) containing 5% FBS and 350 units/ml DNase I, on tissue-culture treated plastic Petri dishes in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C) for 2 hours in order to let macrophage attach on the plastic surface. The non-adherent cells were layered on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25 × g for 20 min. The cell layer at the interface of the two gradients was collected and washed four times with BSS to remove the Percoll. To remove remaining alveolar macrophages, the cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD-14 antibodies at room temperature for 20 min under constant mixing. After the removal of the beads using a magnet and assessment of cell viability by trypan-blue exclusion, the purified type II pneumocyte suspension was suspended in SAGM supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated at a cell density of 300,000 cells/cm2. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37°C) under liquid-covered conditions, and growth medium was changed daily starting from 60 hours after plating the cells.Staining for alkaline phosphatase ::: Characterization of human type II pneumocytes ::: Materials and methodsHuman type II pneumocytes were identified by staining for alkaline phosphatase. Freshly isolated cells were spun down on glass slides, air-dried, and stained for 20 min at room temperature. The stain was prepared by dissolving 10 mg naphthol AS bi-phosphate (Sigma) in 40 μl DMSO and was diluted in 10 ml of 0.125 M 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer (pH 8.9, Sigma) containing 10 mg fast red (Sigma). The slide was washed and counterstained in 1% methylene green (Sigma) for 30 seconds and was mounted in aqueous medium [19].Transmission electron microscopy ::: Characterization of human type II pneumocytes ::: Materials and methodsCells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA, USA), washed three times in phosphate buffered saline and serially dehydrated in acetone. The tissue was post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in an Araldite resin (Polysciences, Inc., Washington, PS, USA). Semi-thin sections (1 μm) were cut using an ultra-microtome (Reichert Ultracut S, Leica Aktiengesellscharft, Wien, Australia) with a diamond knife and were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic examination. Ultra-thin sections (80 nm) mounted on copper grids were electron contrasted with uranyl acetate (1.5 hours, 30°C, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and lead citrate (40 minutes, 20°C, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA, USA), and were examined with a transmission electron microscope (EM 208S, FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA).Flow cytometry ::: Characterization of human type II pneumocytes ::: Materials and methodsThe expression of cell surface antigen was measured by staining purified type II pneumocytes with optimal dilution of rabbit anti-human surfactant protein-C (SP-C) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA) monoclonal antibodies (24°C, 30 minutes) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody; Sigma, F-0257, 24°C, 30 minutes). Each cell preparation was also stained with antibody specific for monocyte/macrophage surface antigen (CD14 conjugated with FITC, MCA2185F; Serotec. Oxford, UK). The cells were examined by the flow cytometry (FACSSCalibur; Becton Dickinson), and the FITC-stained cells were detected by measuring green light emitted at 530 nm (FL1 channel). The percentage of cells expressing the epithelial and macrophage makers were determined.Influenza virus infection of type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells ::: Materials and methodsHuman type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells (seeded at 1 × 106 cells per well in 24-well tissue-culture plates) were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of two unless otherwise indicated. After 60 min of virus adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with warm culture medium (SAGM for type II pneumocytes and BEBM for bronchial epithelial cells) and incubated in medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/L penicillin, 60 mg/L streptomycin, and 2 mg/L N-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated-trypsin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Aliquots of culture supernatant were collected and frozen at -80°C for subsequent virus titration and cytokine analysis. The supernatants were titrated on MDCK cells and the viral titre was quantitated as log10TCID50/ml. RNA was extracted from cells for analysis of cytokine gene expression. Ten hours after infection, replicate cell monolayers were fixed and analyzed by immuno-fluorescent staining specific for influenza virus nucleoprotein (DAKO Imagen, Dako Diagnostics Ltd, Ely, UK) to determine the proportion of cells infected.Quantification of cytokine mRNA by real-time quantitative RT-PCR ::: Materials and methodsDNase-treated total RNA was isolated by means of RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with poly(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) and quantified by real-time PCR analysis with a LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The mRNA for IP-10, interferon beta, IL-6, RANTES and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha were quantitated using real-time RT-PCR. The oligonucleotide primers and methods used for real-time quantification of cytokines, viral matrix gene and the housekeeping gene product γ-actin mRNA have been described previously [12,24].Quantification of cytokine proteins by ELISA ::: Materials and methodsThe concentrations of IP-10, RANTES, interleukin 6 and interferon beta proteins in the primary human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell supernatants were measured by a specific ELISA assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Samples of culture supernatant were irradiated with ultraviolet light (CL-100 Ultra Violet Cross linker) for 15 min to inactivate any infectious virus before the ELISA assays were done. Previous experiments had confirmed that the dose of ultraviolet light used did not affect cytokine concentration as measured by ELISA (data not shown).Statistical analysis ::: Materials and methodsThe quantitative cytokine and chemokine mRNA and protein expression profile were compared using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.In vitro infection of human type II pneumocytes ::: ResultsPrimary human type II pneumocyte yields were 3.5 ± 0.9 × 106 cells/g lung tissue at 92 ± 5% cell purity as demonstrated by the expression of the type II pneumocyte specific marker surfactant protein C (SP-C), lack of the monocyte/macrophage cell surface antigen (CD14) (Fig. 1A and 1B), and by staining for alkaline phosphatase activity. The contaminating cells were predominantly fibroblasts with monocyte/macrophage cells being less than 2%. Cell viability was 91 ± 7% (n = 13). Differences in age and sex of the lung donor had no apparent effects on cell isolation yields and the performance of the cells in culture. The isolated cells spread to form a confluent monolayer, exhibiting protruding nuclei surrounded by thin cytoplasmic extensions. The identity of the cells in culture as human type II pneumocytes was confirmed by demonstrating the presence of lamellar bodies and microvilli by thin section electron microscopy (Figure 2).In vitro infection of human type II pneumocytes ::: ResultsPrevious studies have demonstrated that avian influenza viruses can infect human airway epithelial cells [25]. We first wanted to determine whether alveolar epithelial cells that constitutively reside in the lung can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses in vitro. The cells were infected with influenza A subtypes H5N1 (483/97, 1194/04 and 3046/04) and H1N1 (54/98) at a MOI of 2 and the proportion of cells expressing influenza A virus protein was analyzed at 10 hours post-infection by immunofluorescent staining using an antibody specific for the virus nucleoprotein (DAKO Imagen, Dako Diagnostics Ltd, Ely, UK). Similar proportions (93–100%) of type II pneumocytes infected with H5N1 and H1N1 virus had evidence of viral antigen (nucleoprotein) (Figure 4A). The quantification of influenza M-gene copies at 3 and 6 hours after infection in cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses showed comparable results at 3 and 6 hours post-infection (Figure 4B). Similarly, the infectious viral yield at 24 and 48 hours post-infection from alveolar epithelial cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses were not significantly different (Figure 4C).Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in type II pneumocytes ::: ResultsWe investigated the cytokine induction profile induced by H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in primary human type II pneumocytes. Specifically, we also wanted to determine if the two viruses differed qualitatively or quantitatively in the profile of cytokines induced. The mRNA of several cytokines and chemokines were quantified using quantitative RT-PCR at 3 hr and 6 hr post-infection (Table I). The mRNA levels of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES and IL-6 were significantly up-regulated by influenza virus when compared with the mock infected cells, the genes for IP-10 and interferon beta being the most highly induced. There was no detectable TNF alpha induction in these epithelial cells (data not shown). Inactivation of the virus by ultraviolet irradiation prior to infection of the alveolar epithelial cells abolished cytokine induction (data not shown) suggesting that virus replication was required for cytokine induction.Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in type II pneumocytes ::: ResultsWhen compared with human H1N1 influenza virus, the H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses differentially up-regulated the transcription of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES and IL-6 to significantly higher levels (p < 0.001) (Figure 5). These differences were not explainable by a difference in proportion of cells infected as indicated by immunofluorescence for viral antigen or differences in virus titre (Figure 4). Furthermore, an increase in the multiplicity of infection of 54/98 (H1N1) virus from 2 to 10 did not result in cytokine mRNA concentrations similar to those induced by H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 (data not shown).Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in type II pneumocytes ::: ResultsBroadly, there were two patterns of kinetics of cytokine gene transcription. Cytokines up-regulated from 3 hr post-infection onwards included IP-10, interferon beta and IL-6 whereas RANTES mRNA was only up-regulated at 6 hr post-infection (Table 1). The observations remained valid whether the cytokine mRNA expression data were analyzed with or without normalization for γ-actin mRNA concentrations.Infection and cytokine induction profile of primary human bronchial epithelial cells ::: ResultsThe cytokine and chemokine profiles induced by H1N1, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses in primary human bronchial epithelial cells were similarly investigated. The identity of the cells in culture as human bronchial epithelial cells was confirmed by thin section electron microscopy (Figure 3). The overall gene expression profile was comparable to that seen with type II pneumocytes. The M-gene transcript copy numbers (Figure 6A) and infectious viral yields (Figure 6B) from bronchial epithelial cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses at an MOI of 2 were comparable. The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses differentially up-regulated the transcription of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES and IL-6 to significantly higher levels than the human H1N1 virus (p < 0.001 for IP-10, RANTES and IL-6 and p < 0.01 for interferon beta) (Figure 7). In addition, the two H5N1/04 viruses (1194/04 and 3046/04) differentially up-regulated the transcription of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 to significantly higher levels than the human H1N1 and H5N1/97 viruses (p < 0.05). None of the viruses induced TNF alpha in these cells.Secretion of cytokine proteins from bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells ::: ResultsTo confirm that the observed differences of mRNA are reflected in levels of cytokine and chemokine secreted, the concentrations of the IP-10, RANTES, interleukin 6 and interferon-beta proteins were measured by ELISA in culture supernatants of infected bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. The amount of IP-10 and IL-6 secreted by bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells infected with all three H5N1 viruses at 24 hours post infection were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that secreted by cells infected with H1N1 virus (Figure 8 and 9). At 24 hours post infection, levels of IP-10 induced by H5N1/97 and both H5N1/04 viruses were comparable. However, at 6 hours post-infection, the recent H5N1/04 viruses 1194/04 and 3046/04 appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus (p < 0.05) (Figure 8). RANTES protein secreted from bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in response to H5N1/97 and 1194/04 (H5N1/04) were significantly higher than that induced by H1N1 virus. Although the level RANTES mRNA in 3046/04 (H5N1/04) infected cells at 6 hours post infection was significantly higher than those H1N1 infected cells, the RANTES protein secreted by these cells at 24 hours post infection was only increased 4 fold (p = 0.062; not significant) (Figure 5 and 10). We failed to detect any interferon-beta proteins secreted from the supernatants of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells after influenza viruses infection (data not shown) but it should be noted that the limit of detection of the interferon-beta ELISA was high (250 pg/ml).DiscussionWe found that the replication efficiency of the H5N1 and H1N1 viruses was similar in both primary human alveolar (Figure 4) and bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 6). Both influenza virus subtypes induced an IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES, and IL-6 responses. The cytokine induction was dependent on viral replication since UV-inactivated virus did not induce any effect. Interestingly, we found that H5N1/97 and 1194/04 (H5N1/04) viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon-beta, RANTES and IL-6 mRNA and protein than the human H1N1 virus (Figure 5, 7, 8 to 10). Thus, the observed differences of mRNA are reflected in levels of cytokine and chemokine proteins secreted (Figure 8 to 10). The results with 3046/04 (H5N1/04) were generally similar to 1194/04 (H5N1/04) with the exception that the levels of RANTES protein in type II pneumocytes was not significantly elevated when compared with H1N1 virus infected cells (Figure 10) although the mRNA levels were (Figure 5). Our inability to detect any interferon-beta proteins in our experiments in spite of marked induction of mRNA is probably related to the limited sensitivity of the interferon beta ELISA. A more sensitive bioassay for interferon-beta may be required for this purpose. The type II pneumocytes used in these experiments were derived from a total of 13 donors and each set of experimental data is based on the results of at least three separate experiments from three donors therefore excluding a donor specific artifact. The bronchial epithelial cells were purchased from a commercial source and comes from one donor. However, since the results from these cells are broadly in line with those from the type II pneumocytes, again, we think that donor specific artifacts are unlikely to explain the results we have obtained. Finally, these results are also comparable to our previous observations from primary human monocyte derived macrophages [12] with the exception that in contrast to macrophages, no TNF alpha and IL-1 beta was induced in respiratory epithelial cells by any of the viruses tested.DiscussionThis differential hyper-induction of cytokines was not explained by differences in the replication kinetics between the two virus subtypes. H5N1 viruses isolated from patients with H5N1 disease in Hong Kong in 1997, Vietnam in 2004 and human influenza viruses of the H1N1 subtype all replicate with similar efficiency. Increase in the MOI of the H1N1 virus did not result in an increase of cytokine responses to levels comparable to that of the H5N1 viruses. The cellular mechanisms underlying this differential cytokine hyper-induction by H5N1 viruses are presently poorly understood. Studies on the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line A549 previously demonstrated that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) is involved in the influenza virus A initiated cytokine responses [27]. It remains to be determined whether H5N1 viruses also act via TLR-3 signaling in primary human epithelial cells.DiscussionCytokine and chemokine responses in vivo result from autocrine and paracrine interactions involving many cell types. Chemokines such as IP-10 and MCP-1 are macrophage chemo-attractants and mediate the inflammatory response by further recruitment of circulating leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. We have previously demonstrated that IP-10 and MCP-1 are up-regulated in primary human macrophage by SARS-CoV [28]. The strong induction of chemokines in the lung micro-environment might explain the prominent macrophage infiltrate observed in the lungs of patients with fatal H5N1 [4] as well as SARS [29].DiscussionRANTES attracts monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and T cells, and selectively CD4+ T cells. Its production from the bronchial epithelial cells contributes to the infiltration of the inflammatory cells in airway viral infection [18]. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that can regulate immune and inflammatory responses involved in the activation, growth and differentiation of T-cells [30] and can contribute to T cell mediated inflammatory reactions. In fact, autopsy examination showed an increased CD3+ T cells in the interstitium of the lung from patients with H5N1 diseases [4]. In addition, IL-6 has been shown to be released by macrophages and epithelial cells during lung injury [31] and the effects of IL-6 are synergistic with those of IL-1 and TNF-alpha [32]. We have previously demonstrated that other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 are hyper-induced in H5N1 infected macrophages [12]. Therefore, the differential up-regulation of IL-6 expression in human respiratory epithelial cells and the cytokines induced in macrophages by H5N1 viruses may contribute synergistically to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.DiscussionThe H5N1 viruses have continued to reassort, acquiring different internal genes from other influenza viruses of avian origin [33,34]. The H5N1/04 viruses, A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 represent the Z genotype viruses that emerged as the dominant virus genotype affecting poultry in south-east Asia [27,35]. Thus there appears to be an association between the property of hyper-inducing cytokines and high virulence. Additionally, in pig epithelial cells, H5N1/97 viruses were found to resist the antiviral effects of interferon [36] and this may also be relevant in pathogenesis. It is notable that patients with avian influenza (H5N1) disease appeared to have higher levels of IP-10 in their sera than those with infections with the human influenza viruses [4] providing in vivo data that parallels our present findings in vitro. Studies on recombinant viruses bearing the HA and NA of the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic virus showed that these viruses have enhanced virulence for mice and induce higher levels of macrophage-derived chemokines in vivo in mice [37]. However, such observations of hyper-induction of cytokines in vivo may simply reflect more extensive replication of the respective virus. The studies in vitro with H5N1 viruses exclude such potential confounding factors and it would be relevant to study the cytokine profiles of the 1918 recombinant viruses in in vitro models similar to those described here.ConclusionH5N1 subtype influenza A viruses associated with human disease are more potent than human H1N1 virus at inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IP-10, interferon beta, IL-6 and RANTES, from human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells infected in vitro. Previous findings showed that H5N1/97 viruses also hyper-induce cytokines from macrophages and that patients with H5N1 disease have high levels of IP-10 and other chemokines in the serum. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. The recent re-emergence of H5N1 disease in humans is a cause for renewed pandemic concern and highlights the need for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. Such understanding will lead to new strategies for managing human H5N1 disease and enhance our preparedness to confront pandemic influenza, whether from H5N1 or other influenza A subtypes.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsJSM Peiris, MCW Chan and CY Cheung conceived the study, planned the overall experimental design and wrote the manuscript.

Globalization and risks to health,"Every year, the same ritual takes place at changing locations in the Western world. While the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations meet at their annual G8 summit to discuss the global state of affairs, a wide variety of organizations and protesters meet in parallel to decry what they see as the negative effects of globalization. Notwith-standing these protests, whether one sees globalization as a tool to overcome poverty, hunger and disease in the world or whether one feels threatened by its consequences, one thing is certain: globalization is here to stay. Often narrowly defined as the increasing integration of the world's economies, globalization is in reality a powerful development that presents new challenges at the beginning of this millennium.One major problem is the increasing internationalization of health risks. How-ever defined, this term has many dimensions, including economic, technological, political, social, scientific and cultural aspects. The links between globalization and health are complex and globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect health in myriad ways. Its consequences can be either direct, at the level of whole populations, individuals and healthcare delivery systems, or indirect, through the economy and other factors, such as education, sanitation and water supply (Woodward et al, 2001). Given the enormous complexity and breadth of the issues, our article cannot hope to cover the entire range of topics that link globalization to health. Instead, we focus on those risks to health and health care that are related to central aspects of the globalization process, namely trade, travel and exchange of information.A major factor for the liberalization of international trade has been the multilateral trade negotiations during the past 50 years, which culminated in the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) (Bettcher et al, 2000). Figure 1 illustrates the significant increases in world trade since 1980. Although increasing trade is certainly good for economies, it also leads to a globalization of health risks. Important examples of such risks include tobacco, alcohol, global epidemics of non-communicable diseases and trade in health services.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the death toll from tobacco abuse alone will reach 10 million a year over the next two decades. Up to 70% of these deaths, caused by lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), lung diseases, diabetes and many other tobacco-related ailments, will occur in developing countries (Murray & Lopez, 1997). These countries are at particular risk, as industrialized countries increasingly ban cigarette advertisements and tobacco companies intensively target people in poorer nations as potential customers. The high incidence of smoking among children and adolescents, and the disturbingly low age of initiation, raise additional concerns (Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collaborative Group, 2002).Alcohol consumption is another area in which the globalization of an industry has led to more health risks (Jernigan, 1997). However, unlike tobacco use, which substantially increases the risk of mortality from an impressive array of diseases (Doll, 1998), the impact of alcohol consumption on health is much more complex. There is a strong relationship between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis, some cancers, and most causes of injuries and violence, although minimal amounts of alcohol are sufficient to reduce the risk of CVD (Beaglehole & Yach, 2003).The spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has ... contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foodsThe WHO has estimated that by the year 2020, non-communicable diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, obesity and CVD, will cause about two-thirds of the global disease burden, up from 40% at present. This rapid increase again illustrates the globalized risks for conditions that are mainly caused by diet, even in less developed countries that have coexistent under-nutrition. There were 151 million cases of diabetes worldwide in 2001, and this is estimated to increase by 46% to 221 million cases in 2010, with the steepest growth in the developing world (Zimmet et al, 2001). The same holds true for obesity (Shell, 2001). Of course, not all of this is globalization's fault—these chronic or 'lifestyle' diseases are mainly caused by personal choice, that is, a sedentary lifestyle, the use of tobacco and a fat- and sugar-rich diet. Nevertheless, a key factor has been the unprecedented increase in the global food trade, and its domination by large transnational companies that have developed global brand names and aggressive marketing strategies adapted to local situations (Chopra et al, 2002). The spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has been especially rapid in the developing world during the past two or three decades and has contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat- and calorie-rich foods. It is revealing that only a short period after their introduction on the Chinese market, 65%, 42% and 40% of consumers in China recognized the brands Coca Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé, respectively (Lang, 2001).Globalization of trade is also manifested in the implementation of the WTO's agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which extends patent protection on new drugs for a minimum period of 20 years. As a result of high prices, TRIPS threatens to limit and undermine access to new medicines, especially to poor populations living in the developing world (Kamal & Bailey, 2003). In this sense, the implementation of TRIPS can be seen as exacerbating health risks. Trade and movement of infected cattle and poultry across national borders may also have contributed to recent outbreaks of mad cow disease in the Northern hemisphere and avian influenza in Asia.TRIPS [WTO's agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] threatens to limit and undermine access to new medicines, especially to poor populations living in the developing worldThe globalization of trade is particularly relevant for health services that have become a commodity that can be traded in distinct ways. First, health services can be provided across borders. Examples include a range of telemedicine tools, such as tele-diagnostics and tele-radiology as well as medical consultation through traditional and electronic channels. Second, patients can travel abroad to receive health care or use certain facilities—the UK government recently allowed UK patients to seek treatment in the European Economic Area (Lowson et al, 2002). Other countries, including developing ones such as Cuba and India, openly advertise to attract foreign patients to their clinics and hospitals. Third, health services themselves have become an industry that attracts foreign investments. Several transnational companies from developed and developing countries have already created commercial health services through the purchase and establishment of hospitals (Chanda, 2002). Fourth, the international movement of health personnel across borders has become a significant component of the trade in health services and has attracted considerable attention in the scientific and lay press.Similar to trade, globalization has had large effects on international travel, with serious consequences for global health. The liberalization of the airline industry in many countries has made air travel affordable for more and more people around the world, which has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of global air travel. Sutherst (2004) estimated that about one million people travel internationally every day and a similar number travel between developed and developing countries each week. Another recent report (Gossling, 2002) put the number of global tourist arrivals per year at 700 million. Far-reaching air travel, aided by improvements in aircraft technology that allow longer nonstop flights, facilitates the spread of communicable diseases. It is entirely possible that a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 12–15 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease, aiding its spread, perhaps into vulnerable, non-immune populations. The recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the best contemporary example of the rapid spread of a hitherto unknown and virulent viral pathogen through travel of infected humans (Figs 2, 3 and 4). SARS was first recognized in February 2003 in Vietnam where cases of atypical pneumonia with an unknown cause began to appear. By the first week of May 2003, 30 countries on six continents had reported a total of more than 7,000 probable cases with more than 500 deaths (WHO, 2003a)....a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 12–15 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease...Another example is the global spread of antibiotic-resistant Pneumococcus that was first identified in Spain in the early 1980s and rapidly jumped to South Africa and the USA before spreading to all other parts of the world (WHO, 2000). Each year, approximately two million children die in developing countries as a result of lower respiratory infections, mostly pneumonia. The exact origin of this Pneumococcus strain is still unknown but is likely to come from the Far East (McGee et al, 2001).Perhaps the most profound changes that have taken place during the past 10 years have come through the globalization of ideas and information, facilitated through the revolution in information technology. The internet, satellite television broadcasting and high-speed data links across the globe have dramatically increased access to all kinds of information, even in the most remote corners of the world. Despite early concerns about a 'digital divide' that would further disadvantage the poor, these fears have been overestimated. The reality is that this divide is narrowing between rich and poor countries that have increasing access to cell phone communication and the internet (The Economist, 2004). The success of the food and tobacco industries' aggressive marketing strategies mentioned above have been closely linked to this information revolution.Although better access to information is certainly a good thing, it has also created fears that freely available scientific information might be abused by terrorists (Beck, 2003). Giving basically everyone who is interested access to the full sequences of human pathogen genomes, and the ongoing trend towards open access of published research (Owens, 2003) and even ongoing research activities for new drugs (Hubbard & Love, 2003), poses a serious dilemma with important implications for global health. Should the full sequence of the anthrax bacillus or smallpox virus and other virulent pathogens be published if this data could be used to develop biological weapons? Another example is the development of an improved virus to kill mice that has created fears that the enhanced virus could be used for bioterrorism (Finkel, 2001). Al-Qaeda and the Japanese terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo might have planned to use published research data for nefarious purposes (Petro & Relman, 2003).There is another inherent danger that comes with the vast flood of information now available through the internet, namely the reliability and accuracy of health information from various web sites (Eysenbach et al, 2002). Many such sites contain wrong, misleading and even dangerous information (Crocco et al, 2002), and the lay public are often more confused than informed when they search for health advice.Without doubt, globalization poses risks to global health, but it also provides benefits. The extraordinary improvements in information technology have dramatically increased the speed and ease of data flow, thereby facilitating the sharing of information. Medical discoveries made in one country can be made nearly instantaneously available to patients in other countries (Wassenaar, 2003). It has also sped up the pace of discovery by linking researchers across the globe to work on the same problem, such as the response to SARS. Global cooperation of scientists linked through the internet resulted in the impressively rapid identification of the SARS virus and the development of a diagnostic test (Gerberding, 2003). Similarly, the New England Journal of Medicine used the internet and electronic communication to review, revise and rapidly publish vital articles on the SARS epidemic (Drazen & Campion, 2003).And although many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) decry the negative effects of increasing globalization, they have also clearly benefited from it to improve healthcare delivery and health policy in many developing countries. A recent key contribution of the global NGO movement lies with the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). NGOs had an essential and vital role at the local, national and international levels in all development phases of the FCTC (Mackay, 2003), and their contribution continues as they actively work with countries in the FCTC ratification process.Globalization has also brought about improvements in research methodology, and some argue that clinical research has become more sophisticated as a result (Wassenaar, 2003). Other benefits of globalization include cross-border use of health services that benefit patients and provide much needed resources to national health systems (Jain, 2003) and improved regulatory practices (Wassenaar, 2003). Finally, one should not underestimate the power of knowledge as it empowers populations and individuals and, in turn, allows them to hold to account their political and professional leaders (Ellis, 2003).As the major international agency dealing with global public health issues, the WHO—together with other international organizations—has an important role in mitigating the health risks posed by globalization. Through the FCTC, the WHO has tried to impose more stringent control on tobacco use in its member states. The policies recommend price and tax measures, protection from exposure to second-hand smoke, and regulation and disclosure of the contents of tobacco products. Packaging and labelling, advertising, promotion and sponsorship are also regulated, as are tobacco dependence and cessation measures, illicit trade, sales to and by minors, and liability (Hammond & Assunta, 2003). In May 2003, the final draft of the FCTC was adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly. The treaty has been open for signature since June 2003 and will enter into force once it has been ratified by 40 parties. As of 1 July 2004, 167 countries and the European Community have signed the FCTC and 24 have ratified it, up from nine in March—impressive progress in just four months. The most recent public smoking bans in places such as New York City, Ireland and Norway are clearly further important steps towards protecting public health from the perils of tobacco smoke.Another example of the WHO's key role in global public health are the International Health Regulations (IHR; WHO, 2004). These were used during the SARS epidemic to issue emergency travel advisories for several major cities in the world affected by the disease to discourage and restrict travel and thus contain the virus. These regulations were drafted to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference to world traffic. One of the oldest international political instruments, the IHR started as the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951 to provide a set of rules to protect the world from the spread of what were then referred to as 'quarantinable' diseases; in 1969, this became the IHR. It is now being revised with the goal of providing a framework within which the WHO and other agencies can help countries to respond to future global public health threats by directly linking IHR to the global alert and response network established by the WHO.With regards to the epidemic of overnutrition as the main cause of many chronic, non-communicable diseases, some have suggested that the WHO should help to develop a coordinated global strategy on diet, physical activity and health (Chopra et al, 2002). Such a strategy should include the use of policy, education and trade mechanisms to achieve its goal. To this end, the WHO advocates a healthier lifestyle—a recent joint WHO–FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) report recommends that consumption of added sugars, beyond those naturally present, should be less than 10% of the daily caloric intake (WHO, 2003b)....the development of an improved virus to kill mice...has created fears that the enhanced virus could be used for bioterrorismVarious national and international groups have also been concerned with the quality and accuracy of health information found on the internet. The WHO is leading an initiative to establish a health ('dot health') domain to enhance the credibility of information provided for public and personal health. The WHO proposed to restrict the use of health to content providers who would voluntarily abide by established quality and/or ethical standards. However, in November 2000, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) rejected the WHO's proposal because it was concerned by the vagueness of the WHO's standards for restricting registrars. Objections were also raised, notably by a multinational pharmaceutical company, “as to the appropriateness of according a degree of authoritativeness over the implied accuracy of health-care-related information to a single quasi-governmental organization” (ICANN, 2000).There have also been calls for a global oversight system to regulate and approve research on dangerous pathogens (Steinbruner & Harris, 2003). Participating governments would be required to establish review bodies that regulate relevant research in this area. Such an approach must clearly involve the scientific community and must strike a balance between national security needs against the benefits of open scientific communication for future health improvement.As pointed out above, globalization will not go away. It is therefore important to anticipate future challenges for global health and to consider how to react effectively. One major and increasing problem is the movement of health professionals from developing countries to high-income countries, which threatens the sustainability of health systems in the poor world. The Director General of the WHO, Lee Jong-wook, clearly highlighted this potential threat while addressing the 53rd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa: “Health systems depend most of all on skilled and dedicated personnel, and here we face big challenges, particularly in this region which, on top of everything else, suffers heavy losses to the brain drain” (Lee, 2003). The extent of the problem has been highlighted previously (Pang et al, 2002) and a recent survey from Lithuania, where 61% of medical residents and 26% of physicians surveyed said they intended to leave for the EU or other countries, illustrates well the potential magnitude of health professional brain drain (Stankunas et al, 2004), not just for African countries.However, the migration of health personnel raises a complex ethical dilemma. On the one hand, it appears unethical for developed countries, which often depend on foreign-trained physicians to address shortages in rural areas, to attract health professionals from poorer countries. On the other hand, it hardly seems ethical to prevent skilled workers in search of a better life from accepting better opportunities, financial or professional (Scott et al, 2004). As borders disappear, there is an urgent need to develop strategies, at the national and international level, that will minimize the harm and maximize the benefits of the movement of health personnel. Equally urgent is the need for more information about this problem. There are surprisingly little data on the magnitude of the movement of health professionals between poor and rich countries, and few studies have examined the impact of brain drain on national health systems....freely available scientific information might be at risk of being abused by terroristsForeign direct investment in the health area, notably for the purchase and construction of medical facilities, also brings both opportunities and concerns. As mentioned previously, the presence of foreign commercial healthcare providers and transnational health services have the potential to benefit both patients and national coffers. However, one should not ignore the potential negative impact of privatized health care. A recent systematic review of private for-profit and private not-for-profit dialysis facilities in the USA found that haemodialysis care in not-for-profit centres was associated with a lower risk of mortality (Devereaux et al, 2002). More research to examine the potential impact of foreign commercial presence and cross-border use of health services on health is needed so that regulations can be designed to maximize their benefits and protect patients.As mentioned previously, if patent protection leads to prohibitively priced drugs, it undermines access to new medicines among the most vulnerable populations. The effects of the TRIPS agreement on pharmaceutical prices need to be documented, and the design and implementation of international agreements need to consider the potential effects on developing countries' health systems (Woodward et al, 2001). Similarly, the Essential Drugs List, which guides the selection of drugs on the basis of public health relevance, efficacy, safety and cost, needs to remain an integral part of national drug policies (Smith & Tickell, 2003).There is sufficient evidence that globalization has resulted in higher tobacco consumption, notably in poorer countries (WHO, 2001) and higher alcohol use, particularly among younger individuals (Kuo et al, 2003). It is therefore essential that governments retain the ability within international agreements to regulate so that they can protect public health, especially the ability to restrict, and ban if necessary, advertising and lobbying activities. Finally, the ongoing review of the IHR process must transform these regulations into an effective tool that will allow countries to strengthen global disease surveillance and to respond efficiently to international public health emergencies.The current models of international relations, mobility and movement of goods and people are responsible for the globalization of health risks. These developments clearly lead to an increase in health risks either directly or indirectly, particularly in the developing world where the benefits of globalization are often offset by its adverse effects. More insidiously, the threat of misuse of globalized information for bioterrorism purposes is becoming a serious concern for many governments. International organizations can have an important role in minimizing such risks through regulations, policy recommendations, advocacy and promoting dialogue among interested parties. In addition, to reap the benefits of globalization, we need novel approaches to international cooperation that place national self-interest in the context of global mutual interest and, in this way, promote international cooperation and goodwill (Frenk & Gomez-Dantes, 2002)."
The Transmembrane Oligomers of Coronavirus Protein E,"Coronaviruses, which belong to the family Coronaviridae, cause common colds in humans and are responsible for serious diseases in other species. Recently, one of its members has been found to be the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Rota et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, or envelope, which typically embeds three proteins: spike (S), matrix (M), and the E protein. The envelope surrounds a nucleocapsid, containing the viral RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Proteins S, M, and N have been studied for their important roles in receptor binding and virion budding. For example, the envelope spike protein S mediates attachment to cellular receptors and entry by fusion with cell membranes, whereas the matrix protein M is involved in budding and interacts with N and S proteins (Opstelten et al., 1995; Narayanan et al., 2000).INTRODUCTIONThe significance of the E protein, however, has proved more elusive, but appears to be critical for viral budding, as charged-to-alanine mutations in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been found to produce dramatic morphological changes in the virions (Fischer et al., 1998). Additionally, although in many coronaviruses expression of M protein on its own is not sufficient to produce virus-like particles, co-expression of proteins M and E can readily produce them (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996; Baudoux et al., 1998; Corse and Machamer, 2000). Proteins M and E have been found to interact via their cytoplasmic domains in pre-Golgi compartments (Lim and Liu, 2001). Another role suggested for protein E has been in promoting apoptosis (An et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001), an effect that can be opposed by Bcl-2. Further, recent data (Liao et al., 2004) suggests that SARS coronavirus E protein (SCoVE) can increase membrane permeability and may have ion channel activity.INTRODUCTIONDespite, or because of, its small size, the topology of protein E is still a matter of controversy. Some reports (Corse and Machamer, 2000) have suggested that protein E in IBV traverses the Golgi lipid bilayer once, with the N-terminus facing the Golgi lumen and the C-terminus facing the cytoplasm. Another group (Maeda et al., 2001) has suggested that protein E in MHV traverses the lipid bilayer twice, whereby both N- and C-termini of the protein would reside in the cytoplasm, which is topologically equivalent to the interior of the viral envelope. Even more recently, based on in vitro biophysical studies (Arbely et al., 2004) a short hairpin (12 amino acids long) has been suggested for the putative transmembrane domain of SCoVE.INTRODUCTIONThe explanation for these seemingly conflicting reports may be either of experimental origin or perhaps related to the protein's reported varied functionality. In any case, protein E clearly has the potential to perturb or permeabilize lipid bilayers (Fischer et al., 1998), but the structural determinants involved (pores, hairpins) have not been clearly defined.INTRODUCTIONTo predict a possible transmembrane oligomer of protein E, we have worked under the assumption that protein E contains one transmembrane domain with its N- and C-termini in opposite sides of the membrane (Corse and Machamer, 2000). We have then performed global searching molecular dynamics simulations (Adams et al., 1995) using only the transmembrane sequence of protein E (TME). As the oligomeric size of the hypothetic bundle is not known, we explored different oligomeric sizes, from dimers to hexamers. This procedure was performed on 13 different sequence variants, to select a model that would be evolutionarily conserved (Briggs et al., 2001). The latter strategy has already been used successfully to predict correct models for transmembrane peptides known to form dimers (Briggs et al., 2001), trimers (Kukol et al., 2002), tetramers (Torres et al., 2002a,b), or pentamers (Torres et al., 2002a) for which experimental data was available a priori, and the validity of the predictions could be readily assessed. In this study in contrast, neither the precise topology of protein E, nor the oligomeric size, helix tilt, and helix rotational orientation of the hypothetic α-helical bundle were known.INTRODUCTIONWe reasoned that if a structure could be found that was not affected by any conservative mutation, and if a large number sequences with rather low similarity were used, it would be extremely unlikely that this should happen by chance and therefore the structure should be present in vivo. Surprisingly, we found not one, but four homooligomeric models, a dimer, a trimer and two pentamers, for the transmembrane domain of the coronavirus E protein.Homologous sequences and predicted transmembrane domains ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe sequence of SCoVE (Fig. 1) was obtained from Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL (http://ca.expasy.org/sprot/sprot-top.html), and its homologous sequences were obtained using the FASTA server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33). In total, 13 homologous sequences were used in this study with a minimum similarity of 17% in their predicted transmembrane domain (see Fig. 2). The complete names of these sequences, the abbreviation used in Fig. 2 (within parentheses), and Swiss-Prot entries are: SARS coronavirus E protein (SCoVE), P59637; small envelope protein from SARS coronavirus BJ01 (SCoV_BJ01), Q6QJ39; envelope protein from feline coronavirus (FCoV), O12296; envelope protein from canine coronavirus (CCoV), Q7T6T0; envelope protein from canine enteric coronavirus, strain Insavc-1 (CCoV_Insacv1), VEMP_CVCAI; envelope protein from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, strain Purdue (TGEV_purdue), VEMP_CVPPU; envelope protein from porcine respiratory coronavirus, strain RM4 (PrCoV_RM4), VEMP_CVPRM; putative small membrane protein from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, strain FS772/70 (TGEV_FS772/70), VSMP_CVPFS; small membrane protein E from porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), Q84730; small membrane protein from Rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus (RCoV), Q9IKC8; small membrane protein from Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), O72007; envelope protein from Human coronavirus, strain 229E (HcoV_229E), VEMP_CVH22; and putative small membrane protein from Avian infectious bronchitis virus, strain M41 (IBV_M41), VSMP_IBVM.Homologous sequences and predicted transmembrane domains ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe assignment of the transmembrane domain for each sequence was based on the hydrophilicity/surface probability plots (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982; Emini et al., 1985) and the transmembrane prediction on the TMHMM server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) (Krogh et al., 2001). According to these predictors, the transmembrane region for the sequences spans ∼24 residues and the following residues were used for the simulations: 11–34 for sequences SCoVE, SCoV_BJ01, RCoV, and MHV; 14–37 for sequences CCoV_Insavc1, THEV_purdue, PRCOV_RM4, TGEV_FS772/70, FCoV, and CCoV; 10–33 for sequence HcoV_229E; and 13–36 for sequences PHEV and IBV_M41, all containing the same number of residues, i.e., 24.Global search molecular dynamics (GSMD) protocol ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSFor the simulations we used a Hewlett-Packard Alpha SC45 Cluster containing 44 nodes. All calculations were performed using the Parallel Crystallography and NMR System (PCNS), the parallel-processing version of the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS Version 0.3) (Brunger et al., 1998), with united atom topology (Jorgensen and Tirado-Rives, 1988) explicitly describing only polar and aromatic hydrogen atoms. A global search was carried out in vacuo as described elsewhere (Adams et al., 1995), using CHI 1.1 (CNS Helical Interactions) and assuming a symmetrical interaction between the helices in the homooligomer.Global search molecular dynamics (GSMD) protocol ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTrials were carried out starting from either left or right crossing configurations. The helix tilt, β, was restrained to 0° and the helices were rotated a total of 350° about their long helical axes, in 10° increments. Henceforth, the simulation was repeated by increasing the helix tilt in discrete steps of 5°, up to 40°. We should point out, however, that this restraint is not completely strict, and the helix tilt at the end of the simulation can drift up to ±5° from the restrained value.Global search molecular dynamics (GSMD) protocol ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThree trials were carried out from each starting configuration using different initial random velocities. Increasing oligomeric sizes were examined, from 2 (dimers) to 6 (hexamers). Each protocol was repeated for up to 13 different sequences (Fig. 2). Hence, a total of 9 (tilt) × 36 (rotation) × 5 (size) × 13 (sequences) × 3 (repeats) × 2 (handedness) = 126,360 structures were produced and analyzed, i.e., 25,272 for each oligomeric size and 1,944 for each sequence and a given oligomeric size.Global search molecular dynamics (GSMD) protocol ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSFor each oligomeric size and helix tilt, clusters with a minimum number of structures (typically 10) were identified, where any structure belonging to a particular cluster was typically within 1.0 Å RMSD (root mean-square deviation) from any other structure within that cluster. The structures belonging to each cluster were averaged and subjected to energy minimization. These final structures were taken as the representative of the clusters and represented in the plots (see Figs. 3–5).Analysis of the simulations ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAs previously (Briggs et al., 2001; Torres et al., 2002a), the results from the GSMD simulations were represented graphically by plotting each representative structure as a function of two parameters, helix tilt, β, and rotational orientation, ω of a specific residue, in the ordinate and abcissa axis, respectively. As described previously (Arkin et al., 1997), the rotational orientation angle ω is defined by the angle between a vector perpendicular to the helix axis, oriented toward the middle of the peptidic C=O bond of the residue, and a plane that contains both the helical axis and the normal to the bilayer. This angle is 0° when the residue is located in the direction of the tilt. For all representations in Figs. 3–5, the rotational orientation ω was defined relative to residue 23, indicated as ω23, in the sequence SCovE (see asterisk symbol in Fig. 2), and its equivalent residue for other sequences. The tilt angle of the models, β, was taken as the average of the angles between each helix axis in the bundle and the bundle axis. The bundle axis, coincident with the normal to the bilayer, was calculated by CHI. The helix axis was calculated as a vector with starting and end points above and below a defined residue, where the points correspond to the geometric mean of the coordinates of the five α-carbons N-terminal and the five α-carbons C-terminal to the defined residue. Intersequence comparisons between low energy clusters were performed by calculating the RMSD between their α-carbon backbones. Fitting was performed using the program ProFit (http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit). The energies calculated correspond to the total energy of the system, including both bonded, e.g., bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and nonbonded, i.e., van der Waals and electrostatic terms (Adams et al., 1995).Synthesis of the transmembrane peptide of SARS protein E and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe peptide corresponding to the transmembrane helix of SARS protein E was synthesized in a Respep peptide synthesizer (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG, Cologne, Germany), using standard solid-phase FMOC chemistry, from residue 9 to 35, and adding 2 lysines to both N- and C-ends, to improve solubility. The exact sequence used was KKTGTLIVNSVLLFLAFVVFLLVTLAILTKK, amidated and acylated at C- and N-termini, respectively. The peptide was cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and lyophilized. The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in trifluoroethanol (TFE), TFA and acetonitrile (1:1:4, v/v/v) (final peptide concentration ∼5 mg/ml) and immediately injected to a 20-ml Juppiter 5 C4-300 column (Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK) equilibrated with H2O. Peptide elution was achieved with a linear gradient to a final solvent composition of 10% H2O, 90% acetonitrile, using a Waters 600 HPLC system. All solvents contained 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The resulting fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Peptide purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry.Synthesis of the transmembrane peptide of SARS protein E and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe electrophoretic mobility of the peptide was assessed using SDS/PAGE. SDS sample buffer was added to the lyophilized peptide to a final concentration of 2 μg/μl. After vortexing for 1 min the sample was heated at 70°C for 5 min and loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel (Tris Glycine). The loading volumes were 5, 10, and 20 μl. The sample was electrophoresed at room temperature at a constant voltage of 100 V for 30 min. After completion, the SDS/PAGE gel was first stained with Coomassie blue, followed by silver staining with the Silver stain-Plus kit (Bio-Rad).Homodimer simulations ::: RESULTSFig. 3 (panel a) shows the results of the simulations when TME was assumed to be a homodimeric α-helical bundle. Only the results corresponding to a restrained helix tilt to 10° are shown, because no persistent models were found at any other helix tilt tested. The preserved configuration is right-handed (models below the horizontal broken line) and has an average orientation of β = 12° and ω23 = −23° (vertical broken line). To guide the eye, the models consistent with this configuration for each of the sequences have been enclosed within a small rectangle. We note that helix tilt versus ω is just a convenient way of representation, and structures with up to 20° difference in the ω for a certain residue can in fact be very similar, e.g., for SCoVE ω23 is −33°, not −23°.Homodimer simulations ::: RESULTSNo structure within this set, which spans all sequences tested, was found to differ from any other in the same set by more than 1.5 Å Cα RMSD. This RMSD value is higher than that reported previously (below 1 Å RMSD) using the same method for various other homooligomers (Briggs et al., 2001), which casts some doubts on the relevance of this structure. However, one must take into account the low similarity between the transmembrane sequences used here (17%) compared to those used in previous work (more than 50%) (Briggs et al., 2001; Torres et al., 2002a). It is therefore possible that the high RMSD observed is due to the low similarity of the sequences used, which in turn may indicate that the structure represented by these sequences is not identical. In fact we have observed a smaller RMSD (1.15 Å) when using sequences from the same coronavirus group.Homodimer simulations ::: RESULTSWe can also assess the relevance of this model by observing the energy values obtained in each simulation (Torres et al., 2002a). If the model is correct, the lowest energy models for each sequence will tend to cluster around that particular conformation. Panel b in Fig. 3 shows that the lowest energy models (highlighted by shading) for each sequence cluster around ω = −23° (vertical dotted line), which is where the persistent conformation appears. We conclude therefore that protein E forms a homodimeric structure. Slices corresponding to this dimeric model for sequence SCoVE are represented in Fig. 6 (left column).Homotrimer simulations ::: RESULTSFig. 4 shows the results of the simulations assuming a homotrimeric α-helical bundle when the helix tilt was restrained to 35°. Only in this case a persistent left-handed conformation was found, at β = 32°, ω = −113°. No structure within this complete set (see symbols within small rectangles) differed from any other in the same set by more than 1 Å Cα RMSD. As in the case of the dimer, the energy plot in panel b shows that the lowest energy model for each simulation-sequence appears at, or near, the ω representing the complete set. The slices corresponding to this trimeric model are presented in Fig. 6.Homotetramer simulations ::: RESULTSFor the homotetramer, no complete set like those described for dimer and trimer could be found for any restrained helix tilt, even at 2 Å Cα RMSD. The results are not shown.Homopentamer simulations ::: RESULTSFig. 5 (panel a) shows the results of the simulations assuming a homopentameric arrangement. In this case, only when the helix was restrained to 25° and in a left-handed configuration, not one, but two persistent models were found. One model (A) appeared at β = 23°, ω = −121° (right vertical broken line) and the other model (B) appeared at β = 20°, ω = −176° (left vertical broken line). No structure within each of these complete sets represented by models A and B differed from any other structure in the same set by more than 1.0 Å Cα RMSD. When we tried to determine which of the models was correct based on their energies (panel b) we found that, except for PHEV, all lowest energy models are close or near ω = −121, i.e., form A, which is a strong indication that model A is the correct one and model B must be a false positive. Intriguingly however, for the outlier sequence PHEV, the lowest energy model is equivalent precisely to form B (ω = −176°). We hypothesize that models A and B could represent closed (low energy) and open (high energy) forms of a channel (see Discussion). Slices through both structures are given in Fig. 6 (two columns on the right).Homohexamer simulations ::: RESULTSAs for the tetramer, no complete set could be found for any restrained helix tilt, even at 2 Å Cα RMSD. The results are not shown. Higher order oligomers were not tested.SDS-PAGE of the transmembrane domain of SARS protein E ::: RESULTSTo assess experimentally the aggregation state of coronavirus protein E, the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E (TME) was solubilized in SDS and electrophoresed (see Materials and Methods). At the three concentrations of peptide tested (Fig. 7, lanes 2–4), we could observe bands consistent with the presence of dimers, trimers and pentamers in SDS. Coomassie blue staining was sufficient for the most concentrated lane (lane 4), but after silver staining also lanes 2 and 3 showed the presence of the three oligomers. No other oligomeric form was detected.DISCUSSIONAfter an exhaustive exploration of the conformational space of the transmembrane domain of protein E (TME), we have found that only a dimer (β = 12°, right-handed), a trimer (β = 35°, left-handed), and two pentamers (β = 25°, both left-handed) have been conserved by the conservative mutations appeared during evolution.DISCUSSIONWe note that, in contrast with previous work (Briggs et al., 2001; Kukol et al., 2002; Torres et al., 2002a), where we successfully obtained models in agreement with experimental data, no indication exists regarding the existence of a transmembrane α-helical homooligomer of coronavirus protein E in vivo or in vitro. Also, no structural data is available that permits to confirm or discard a given model. Could then these models have been conserved just by chance?DISCUSSIONThe first indication this is not the case is the extremely low probability that a model would survive all the conservative mutations present in 13 sequences with a similarity of only 17%. Clearly, the probability of finding a model only by chance decreases when the number of sequences analyzed is increased. Also, the lower the similarity between these sequences, the more stringent is the selection procedure, and the similarity between the sequences used here is as small as 17%, far below 50% used in previous work (Briggs et al., 2001).DISCUSSIONThe second indication that supports our prediction is based on the relative energies of the resulting models. If the correct model is the most stable, then it is expected that for every sequence the lowest energy model will be close to that represented by the complete set. Because of inaccuracies in the force-fields and other factors however, not all lowest energy models will have the same conformation, but they will cluster around the conformation of the correct structure, as confirmed previously in other proteins (Torres et al., 2002a). Consistent with this, the lowest energy models found in each aggregation state, dimeric, trimeric, or pentameric, for every sequence tested, cluster around the conformation of the persistent model.DISCUSSIONThe third indication is that, as we show in Fig. 7, the transmembrane domain of SARS protein E is sufficient to form dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric homooligomers in SDS micelles. Recent in vivo studies performed on the whole protein (Liao et al., 2004) also show dimers and trimers in nonreducing conditions, but only monomers in reducing conditions which prevent disulfide bond formation between monomers via the extramembrane cysteine residues (see Fig. 1). Overall, these combined results suggest that although the specificity in the interactions between monomers resides in the transmembrane domain, a dramatic effect on oligomerization is contributed by the extramembrane domain, specifically, but possibly not limited to, intermonomer disulfide bonds. In addition, the reported membrane permeabilizing activity of SCoVE (Liao et al., 2004) is consistent with our prediction of a pentameric bundle or pore, for which we find two close conformations, A and B. Although based on their energy values only model A appears to be correct, it is intriguing that the only persistent models found after a systematic search for a homopentamer should have the same handedness and helix tilt and be separated by a rotation of their helices of just 55°. We propose therefore that these two models could represent open and closed states of a channel, as both conformations should have been equally conserved during evolution. This is clearly reminiscent of phospholamban, where the possible existence of two transmembrane homopentameric models separated only by a rotation of their helices of ∼40° has been discussed (Torres et al., 2001, 2002a).DISCUSSIONThe fourth and final indication is that we have predicted previously, using a method similar to the one described here, a transmembrane homotetrameric form for a component of the T-cell receptor, CD3-ζ (Torres et al., 2002b) for which only homodimers have been found experimentally. Recently, this prediction was partially confirmed by the observation of a homotetrameric form of the cytoplasmic domain of CD3-ζ (Sigalov et al., 2004) that could only be detected at very high concentrations. As both CD3-ζ and protein E are targeted to lipid rafts, it is possible that the local increase in concentration catalyzes the formation of many types of oligomers.DISCUSSIONAnother implication of this work is on protein E topology. Our results implicitly support a topology for protein E where N- and C-termini are in opposite sides of the membrane (Corse and Machamer, 2000). The latter authors showed unquestionably that the long hydrophilic tail (C-terminus) is facing the cytoplasm and therefore should be located in the inside of the virion envelope. Consistently, Raamsman et al. (2000) found that protein E was not digested after treating MHV particles with proteinase K in the absence of detergent. It was concluded that no part of protein E faces the virus exterior, although a question should be raised about the accessibility of such a small N-terminus to proteinase K (∼10 amino acids, probably associated to the membrane). In fact, Yu et al. (1994) showed previously using an antibody against protein E in MHV that protein E was accessible from the surface of the virion envelope. Recently, Maeda et al. (2001) targeted a hydrophylic peptide (a flag) added to either the N- or the C-termini of protein E with antibodies and suggested that both N- and C-termini of the protein would reside in the cytoplasm, i.e., topologically equivalent to the virus lumen. These authors argued that an alternative explanation for the data reported by Corse and Machamer (2000) was that although both C and N are in the cytoplasmic domain, the N-terminus was simply too short to be targeted by the antibody. Even more recently, in vitro biophysical studies (Arbely et al., 2004) have led to the suggestion that the putative TM domain of protein E forms a short hairpin that inserts only partially in the membrane.DISCUSSIONWe do not discard that more than one structural model for protein E can be present during the virion cycle, attending to its putative functional diversity. These different structural models could arise in different environments. For example, many viral envelope proteins contain putative palmitoylated sites and it is thought that this modification is important in protein-protein interactions during virus assembly. Palmitoylation may also induce raft partitioning, as shown for example in HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Bhattacharya et al., 2004). The cytoplasmic tail of SCovE, for example, contains one or more putative palmitoylation sites, and specifically, a “double cysteine” CC motif, which is a strong predictor of palmitoylation, as exemplified in various receptors (Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003). In addition, in IBV (Corse and Machamer, 2002) and in MHV (Yu et al., 1994) protein E has already been shown to be palmitoylated. It is possible that this reversible covalent modification could trigger conformational changes critical for function. Physical interaction of this domain with the M protein is critical in the formation of the virion (Lim and Liu, 2001). An interesting possibility therefore is that palmitoylation and the subsequent close association of the cytoplasmic tail to the lipid bilayer may trigger a conformational change, or even the formation of a TM hairpin. Both in vitro and in vivo studies are currently being performed in our labs to test each of these hypotheses."
RNA Viral Community in Human Feces: Prevalence of Plant Pathogenic Viruses,"The human gastrointestinal tract is the natural habitat for a large microbial community including species from the kingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya [1]. It is estimated that the human gastrointestinal (GI) flora contains 1014 microorganisms. Most of these microbes are symbiotic to the human host and beneficial to food digestion [2,3]. The GI microbiota also contains enteric viruses, including a variety of bacteriophages and a number of known human viruses and uncharacterized viruses. Bacteriophages can influence food digestion by regulating microbial communities in the human GI tract through lytic and lysogenic replication [4]. Bacteriophages may also contribute to human health by controlling invading pathogens [5]. In addition to bacteriophages, the other well-studied human enteric viruses are the viral pathogens associated with gastroenteritis. They can infect the human small intestine cells, causing damage to the epithelial lining and the absorptive villi, leading to the malabsorption of water and an electrolyte imbalance [6,7]. Many viral pathogens have been isolated from the feces of gastroenteritis patients, including rotavirus, astrovirus, calicivirus, hepatatis E virus, certain members of coronavirus and torovirus, and the enteric adenovirus (serotypes 40 and 41) [8–11]. Except for the adenoviruses, which contain DNA genomes, all the others are RNA viruses. Despite intensive studies, many causative agents of human gastroenteritis are still unknown.IntroductionTraditionally, discovery of viruses was dependent on culturing the viruses in host cells in order to propagate and isolate enough pure virions for characterization. However, it is generally known that the large majority of viruses, including enteric viruses, cannot be cultivated using standard techniques. For instance, some Norwalk viral agents causing gastroenteritis could not be grown in cell cultures [12,13]. The only way to obtain adequate virus particles for characterization of these viruses was to feed the volunteer human adults with stool filtrates derived from the disease outbreak [14]. Hence, culture-based methods are insufficient for large-scale characterization of the viral community in the human GI tract. In addition, viruses do not have ubiquitously conserved genetic elements such as rDNA that can be used as diversity and evolutionary distance markers [15].IntroductionMetagenomic analyses offer an opportunity to directly characterize mixed genomes of uncultured viruses. In combination with tangential flow filtration for viral particle isolation and concentration from large volume samples, metagenomic analyses have been employed to survey the DNA viruses in seawater [16] and from human feces [17]. Based on the analysis of about 500 sequences, it was found that the majority of DNA viruses in human feces were novel, and most of the recognizable sequences belonged to bacteriophages. Similar metagenomic approaches have also been applied, in large scale, to bacteria in seawater [18] and other environmental samples [19,20].IntroductionTo date, very little information is available on the human enteric RNA viral flora, despite the fact that many RNA viruses are known etiologic agents of gastroenteritis. To expand our understanding of the RNA viral flora in the human GI tract, we conducted a comprehensive metagenomic analysis of uncultured RNA viruses isolated from the feces of healthy humans. Surprisingly, we discovered that some plant RNA viruses were highly abundant in human feces.Identification of RNA Viruses in Human Feces ::: ResultsThree fecal samples from two healthy adults living in San Diego were used for virus isolation. Samples 1 and 2 were from the same individual, with a gap of 6 mo between the sample collections. Sample 3 was from a second individual. We concentrated the feces-borne viral particles using tangential flow filtration as described previously [17]. We further treated the viral concentrates with DNase and RNase to eliminate potential contamination with free nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample and converted into cDNA, which was used to construct a shotgun library for sequencing analysis. From the three libraries (designated as Lib 1, Lib 2, and Lib 3 corresponding to samples 1, 2, and 3), we generated 10,576, 13,572, and 12,621 high-quality sequence reads, respectively (Table 1). Each sequence read represents an individual clone in the libraries.Identification of RNA Viruses in Human Feces ::: ResultsOf the total 36,769 sequences, 33,643 (91.5%) were similar to known sequences in the GenBank nr (nonredundant) database based on tBLASTx (e-value <0.001), and are therefore designated as “known” (Table 1). Of these 33,643 known sequences, 25,779 (76.6%) were most similar to viruses and 7,864 (23.4%) were most similar to Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukarya. Of the nonviral known sequences, 6,828 (86.8%) were similar to ribosomal RNA. The presence of ribosomal RNA-like sequences in these libraries may reflect the copurification of some ribosomes with the virions from the fecal extracts during tangential flow filtration.Identification of RNA Viruses in Human Feces ::: ResultsBased on the best hit of tBLASTx analysis, the virus-like sequences were assigned to 42 viral species, including two animal viruses, 35 plant viruses, one yeast virus, and four bacteriophages (Table 2). The number of sequences related to yeast viruses and bacteriophages in these libraries were insignificant, with only one and seven clones matching them, respectively. Surprisingly, of the virus-like sequences, 25,040 (97.1%) were homologous to plant viruses, while less than 735 (2.9%) resembled animal viruses. This is distinct from the previously reported DNA fecal viral library, in which most virus-like sequences were similar to phages [17]. Furthermore, no RNA phage-like sequences were observed in this study, which may reflect the rare occurrence of RNA phages in human feces [21]. Notably, very few DNA virus-like sequences (eight clones) were found in these libraries, indicating that DNA contamination was essentially eliminated during our isolation procedure.Identification of RNA Viruses in Human Feces ::: ResultsThe most abundant virus in the fecal RNA viral libraries was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV). PMMV is a well-characterized plant pathogenic virus that infects all species in the genus Capsicum, including a wide variety of sweet and hot peppers [22,23]. A total of 21,838 sequences were mapped across the entire genome of PMMV (6,357 bp). The levels of sequence homology to the PMMV reference genome sequence were highly variable, suggesting that multiple variants of PMMV might be present in these samples. In addition, 24 out of the 35 plant viruses detected in these fecal samples were known pathogens of consumable crops including fruits, vegetables, tobaccos, and cereals (Table 3), suggesting that foods contaminated with plant viruses might have contributed to the RNA viral flora in human feces.Identification of RNA Viruses in Human Feces ::: ResultsThe most common animal virus (total of 735 clones) identified in the RNA viral libraries was a picobirnavirus (PBV, 733 clones). PBV belongs to a recently identified family of RNA viruses with bisegmented genomes, which are present in the stools of humans and animals [24,25]. In humans, PBV has been found in both healthy individuals and diarrhea patients [26]. The other animal virus identified (Moloney murine leukemia virus) was only represented by two clones. In summary, we found that the human feces-borne RNA viral community is dominated by viruses similar to plant RNA viruses, exemplified by the abundance of PMMV.The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsOf the 42 viral species identified, 32 were present in only one of the libraries. Among the common viral species, four were present in all three libraries, and six were found in only two libraries. Hence, the overlap between these libraries was quite small in terms of the types of viral species (see Table 2).The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsAlthough there were 27, 24, and ten viral species identified in Lib 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the majority of the clones in these libraries were represented by only a few dominant viral species (see Table 2). For instance, in Lib 1, PMMV, oat blue dwarf virus, and grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus were the top three species represented by 80%, 13.6%, and 3.0% of the 9,961 virus-like clones, respectively. In Lib 2, PMMV (75.7%), PBV (8%), maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV, 7.7%), oat chlorotic stunt virus (OCSV, 2.9%), panicum mosaic virus (PanMV, 1.8%), and tobacco mosaic virus (1.3%) were the six major viral species of the 7,807 virus-like clones. In Lib 3, PMMV was the only dominant viral species, accounting for 99.4% of the 8,011 virus-like sequences. It is interesting to note that, except for PMMV, which was predominant in all three libraries, the other major species found in each of the three libraries were quite different. For instance, oat blue dwarf virus and grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus were the second and third most abundant viruses in Lib 1, but were undetectable in Lib 2. Similarly, MCMV, OCSV, and PanMV were the second, third, and fourth most abundant viruses in Lib 2, but were not found in Lib 1. Since Lib 1 and Lib 2 were derived from feces collected from the same individual 6 mo apart, these differences most likely reflect fluctuations in the fecal RNA viral community of a single individual over time.The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsTo further address the dynamics of human feces-borne viruses, we compared the PBV-like clone sequences from Lib 1 and Lib 2 (Figure 1). It is known that human PBV has two distinct genogroups, represented by two prototype strains, 4-GA-91 and 1-CHN-97 [26,27]. The members of the former genogroup are highly conserved, while the members of the latter are quite variable. The sequence identity between the two prototypes is 28% at the nucleotide level and 40% at the amino acids level. To facilitate the comparative analysis, we clustered the PBV-like sequences of each library into contigs (using minimum overlaps of 40 bp and over 95% identity) and aligned them to the partial genome sequences of the 4-GA-91 and 1-CHN-97 available in GenBank. The five contigs from 27 PBV-like sequences from Lib 1 were highly similar (over 90% identical at nucleotide level) to the conserved PBV strain 4-GA-91 (Figure 1A) but had no matches to the other prototype strain. In contrast, the 26 contigs from 701 PBV-like sequences from Lib 2 were only marginally homologous (46%–69% homology at the amino acid level) to the variable strain 1-CHN-97 (Figure 1B). It is important to note that the PBV populations in the two fecal samples (samples 1 and 2) from the same individual represented distinct genogroups, once again highlighting the dynamic nature of the human enteric RNA viral flora.The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsSimilarly, the other fecal viruses, including PMMV, identified in this study also appeared variable. Using a minimum overlap of 40 bp and more than 95% identity, we clustered all PMMV-like sequences and generated 376 (Lib 1), 359 (Lib 2), and 225 (Lib 3) unique PMMV genome sequence segments. The largest PMMV contig was 3,158 bp in length and contained 1,817 clones. Even though the feces-borne PMMV sequences gave over 200-fold coverage of the reference PMMV genome, a complete fecal PMMV genome could still not be assembled de novo. As shown in Figure 2, the PMMV-like sequences within each library had a wide range of BLAST scores to the PMMV reference genome, suggesting that the feces-borne PMMV sequences were very divergent and represented novel PMMV variants. Similar results were observed for other viral species (unpublished data).The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsWe further analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of PMMV variations in these libraries. There are seven complete PMMV genomes and 14 individual PMMV coat protein (CP) gene sequences available in GenBank. To utilize the maximum number of reference sequences, we decided to use the CP gene for phylogenetic analysis together with the PMMV-like sequences identified in the three libraries. Since the first 101 bp of the 474-bp CP gene (from 5,685 to 6,158 bp of the PMMV genome) had the most sequences (44 unique assembled PMMV sequence segments) mapping to it, we chose this region for phylogenetic analysis. The majority of the 44 feces-borne PMMV sequences were grouped into five main phylogenetic clusters (Figure 3). The previously known PMMV CP gene sequences were found mostly in three clusters (clusters I, II, and III). Interestingly, most of the PMMV sequences found in Lib 1 were grouped in cluster IV, however, only one sequence from Lib 2 was grouped into this cluster, indicating that the PMMV strains were very different even in two fecal samples collected from the same individual, and implying that the human fecal PMMV population was dynamic.The Diversity and Dynamics of the RNA Viral Community in Human Feces ::: ResultsTaken together, our sequence analysis clearly showed that the RNA viral flora in human feces is diverse and dynamic at both species and strain levels, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the heterogeneous nature of human feces and different sequencing coverage in these libraries may also contribute to the variations observed.The Prevalence of PMMV in the Human Population ::: ResultsTo confirm the presence of the viruses identified through shotgun library sequencing, we used RT-PCR to detect these viruses directly from the fecal samples used for library construction. We first detected the presence of PMMV in a fecal sample and validated that our RT-PCR detection is specific and reliable (Figure 4A and 4B). We then extended the test for the five most abundant viruses identified in Lib 2 (PMMV, MCMV, PBV, OCSV, and PanMV; see Table 2), and all were positive from the primary fecal sample 2 (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the relative quantities of the RT-PCR products for each of the viruses tested were in good correlation with the relative abundance reflected by the number of clones observed for each of the viruses in the shotgun library.The Prevalence of PMMV in the Human Population ::: ResultsSince the plant viruses identified from the libraries were mostly food crop pathogens, we suspected that the plant viruses found in feces might have originated in food. We then used PMMV as the model to test the existence of plant viruses in food, and estimated the viral loads in food and feces by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR assay. Three pairs of food-fecal samples from three healthy individuals were collected for total RNA extraction. For each sample pair, small aliquots were taken from all the foods consumed by the participants for 2 d prior to the time of feces collection. The quantity of RNA used for the RT-PCR assay was adjusted based on equal dry weight. As shown in Figure 4D, PMMV was found in both food and feces from all three individuals, and the virus copy number was in the range of 106–109 per gram of dry feces based on the TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR results. The PMMV viral load in feces was enriched 20-fold (Figure 4D; lane 2 versus 1), 224-fold (lane 4 versus 3), and 8-fold (lane 6 versus 5) in pairwise comparisons with food (estimated virus copy numbers are shown in Figure 4). Besides the possible experimental error in measurement, the differences in enrichment of PMMV in feces might reflect the different levels of reduction and condensation of mass from food to feces through absorption during digestion in different individuals and at different times.The Prevalence of PMMV in the Human Population ::: ResultsTo determine the prevalence of PMMV among human fecal samples, six more fecal samples were collected from different individuals in San Diego, California, United States for RT-PCR analysis. Three of these additional samples were positive for PMMV (Figure 4E; lanes 2, 4, and 5). Together with the previous three positive fecal samples tested (Figure 4D; lanes 2, 4, and 6), the overall positive rate was 6/9 (66.7%) in San Diego. To ascertain if PMMV is found only in North Americans, we tested nine human fecal samples (including one from a newborn) from Singapore, and six were positive for PMMV (Figure 4F; lanes 1, 2, and 5–8). Notably, the infant fecal sample was negative for PMMV (lane 9). Hence, the presence of PMMV in feces is not geographically restricted. Among the nine individuals from Singapore, six had had peppers in their recent meals. Interestingly, PMMV was detected in feces from five of them.The Prevalence of PMMV in the Human Population ::: ResultsSince peppers were indicated as a potential source of PMMV, we collected a panel of pepper-containing foods from San Diego for RT-PCR testing. Out of 22 fresh and processed pepper samples tested, only three were positive, including bottled hot chili sauce and powdered chili (unpublished data). Interestingly, none of the fresh, healthy-looking peppers tested were positive for PMMV. To further investigate the presence of PMMV in chili sauces, seven randomly collected samples from food stalls in Singapore were tested; four of these chili sauces contained PMMV (Figure 4G; lanes 1 and 3–5). Together, these data demonstrate that food is a potential source of PMMV in human feces, and that intact PMMV nucleic acids can survive standard food processing.The Prevalence of PMMV in the Human Population ::: ResultsWe then assessed if the feces-borne PMMV viruses were viable and able to infect host plants. Two Hungarian wax pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants were inoculated with a small amount of PMMV-positive fecal suspension. Within 1 wk, all inoculated plant leaves developed typical symptoms of PMMV infection (Figure 5), while the five control plants remained healthy. Total RNA extracted from the infected and healthy leaves of the same plant were tested for PMMV (Figure 5B). PMMV could only be detected in the infected leaf (Figure 5B; lane 2), and this PCR diagnostic band was confirmed by sequencing. Thus, the PMMV shed from the human GI tract is still infectious to host plants.DiscussionThe original intention of this study was to identify human enteric viruses or other human viruses through a metagenomic survey of uncultured RNA viruses in human feces. However, we found that animal viruses were uncommon in healthy human feces and were limited to PBVs. It might be possible that human viruses replicating in mucosal cells were undetectable in stools from healthy individuals but are abundantly shed into feces in inflammatory conditions when symptoms such as diarrhea develop [28]. Therefore, analysis of fecal samples from diarrhea patients would be the logical extension of this study to identify unknown pathogenic human enteric viruses.DiscussionUnexpectedly, we discovered a large and diverse community of plant RNA viruses exemplified by PMMV in human feces. PMMV was found in two-thirds of the individuals tested from two different continents (San Diego in North America and Singapore in Southeast Asia), suggesting that PMMV is prevalent in human populations. We also observed that the RNA viral community in human feces was dynamic. The representation of RNA viruses found in a single individual over time or in different individuals varied substantially. Considering that most of the feces-borne plant viruses identified in this study are known to be pathogenic to vegetable crops and that PMMV was detectable in processed pepper food (chili sauces), we speculate that foods might be the major source of fecally borne RNA viruses. Fluctuations of the RNA viral populations in human feces may be associated with the kinds of food consumed, methods of food preparation, and idiosyncratic conditions in the GI tract.DiscussionWe further provide evidence that the fecal PMMV was viable and could cause infection to a host plant. PMMV viruses appeared to be stable through the human digestive system. This is consistent with the observation that members of Tobamovirus, including PMMV, are extremely robust viruses and can survive in challenging environments [29,30]. The data presented here suggest that humans (and likely other animals) may play a significant role as transmission vectors for certain plant viruses through their digestive tracts. The discovery of this previously unknown transmission route for plant viruses is potentially important for a better understanding of certain agricultural practices, because in traditional agriculture and in developing countries, human and animal refuse are often used as fertilizers for crops.DiscussionSince the PMMV was abundant in the fluid phase of fecal material by RT-PCR and library sequencing, it is conceivable that these viruses might disassociate from the plant tissues and therefore are readily accessible to host epithelial cells and microbial cells existing in the intestinal environment. Earlier studies showed that plant viral particles could be assembled in Escherichia coli cells [31,32], which leads to the speculation that some feces-borne plant viruses might be capable of interacting with microbes in human guts. In this study, the amount of fecal PMMV appeared to be significantly higher than the virus load found in food based on equal dry weight. This increase could be a result of the digestive reduction of food, or viral replication in the human gut. PMMV, like other members of Tobamovirus, is a plus-stranded RNA virus [33]. During replication in host cells, a complementary minus-strand RNA is synthesized from the genomic plus-stranded RNA template and serves as the template for genomic RNA. Hence, evidence of viral replication is the presence of the minus-strand RNA. We were unable to detect the minus strand of PMMV as an indication of replication using a strand-specific RT-PCR method [34,35]. Hence, the evidence for active replication of PMMV in human feces is currently lacking. Further research efforts are needed to determine whether and how plant viruses may interact with intestinal cells or microorganisms in the human GI tract.DiscussionThis study demonstrates the existence of abundant and dynamic populations of live plant pathogenic viruses in human feces. It is already known that complex symbiotic interactions exist between viruses, plant hosts, and their insect vectors [36,37]. For the tomato yellow leaf curl virus, the lifespan of its whitefly vector, Bemisua tabaci, is reduced by one-fifth, and their fecundity is reduced by one-half during viral transmission [38], which suggests that viral replication may affect health of the vector. Given that nonpathogenic commensal intestinal bacteria can significantly alter the immune system of an organism [39], it is conceivable that viruses such as PMMV, replicating or not, may also have an effect. Nevertheless, the stability of PMMV, and perhaps other plant viruses, in the human GI tract may allow them to be used as a platform for oral vaccine development [40] to prevent diarrhea and other intestinal disorders.Fecal samples ::: Materials and MethodsThree fecal samples from two healthy adults living in San Diego, California, United States were collected for RNA viral isolation and sequencing analysis. Samples 1 and 2 were from the same individual with a gap of 6 mo between sample collections. Sample 3 was from a second individual. The two human participants in this study had no history or recent symptoms of diarrhea or any known gastrointestinal illness, and had a reasonably balanced daily diet of meat, vegetables, and grains (bread, rice, or noodle).Fecal samples ::: Materials and MethodsAdditional fecal samples were obtained later for RT-PCR detection of specific feces-borne viruses. Six fecal samples were collected from six healthy humans who worked together in the same building, but lived in different locations in the San Diego area. Subsequently, nine fecal samples were collected from nine individuals living in Singapore (including one infant). For the Singapore group, we undertook a comprehensive record and analysis of food intake prior to sample donation (Table 4). The food intake of participants was documented over a period of 3 d prior to fecal sample collection. Foods were grouped by their main nutritional composition, namely protein, carbohydrate, fat, dietary fiber, and calcium. Foods that contain added microorganisms were categorized as probiotics.Viral isolation ::: Materials and MethodsViral isolation and concentration were performed as described previously [17]. Briefly, approximately 500 g of fresh fecal matter was resuspended in 5 l of SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 10 mM MgSO4), and this material was passed through a Nitex filter (pore size ~100 μm) followed by filtration through a 0.2-μm tangential flow filter (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The viral particles were then concentrated on a 100-kDa tangential flow filter (Amersham Biosciences). The viral concentrates were stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) and visualized using epifluorescent microscopy to ensure the recovery of viruses and removal of microbial cells [41]. DNase I and RNase A were added to a final concentration of 1 unit per 100 μl of viral concentrate, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to remove any contamination by free nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was then treated with DNase to eliminate any DNA contamination.Viral RNA shotgun library construction ::: Materials and MethodsApproximately 140–200 ng of purified viral RNA of each sample was utilized for cDNA synthesis using a random priming approach following the protocol from SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was divided into two aliquots, which were digested separately with either TaqI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts, United States) or Csp6I (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) to generate short overlapping DNA fragments. TaqI- and Csp6I-digested cDNA fragments were ligated with TaqI and Csp6I adaptors (oligo sequences in Table 5) at 16 °C overnight, respectively. The TaqI and Csp6I adaptor-ligated DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using forward primers TaqI-F and Csp6I-F for 40 cycles, respectively. DNA fragments between 500 and 1,000 bp were fractionated and cloned into Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning vectors (Invitrogen) for sequencing.Sequence production and analysis ::: Materials and MethodsThe viral cDNA clones were prepared as plasmid templates for sequencing by an ABI3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). The raw sequence reads were subjected to base calling and vector/adaptor trimming using PHRED [42,43]. High-quality sequences for all three libraries were searched for homology against the nonredundant nucleotide database (nr) in GenBank using tBLASTx [44,45]. Sequences that had tBLASTx hits with an e-value less than 0.001 were considered known, and the top hit was assigned to the particular sequence for annotation; otherwise they were considered unknown. Based on the best tBLASTx hit, virus-like sequences were further classified based on hosts, such as plant, animal, or bacterial origins. Nonviral sequences were subjected to BLASTn against the European ribosomal RNA database (http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA/index.html). Sequences that had BLAST hits to this database with an e-value less than 0.001 were considered to be structural ribosomal RNA.Sequence clustering ::: Materials and MethodsFor each library, shotgun viral sequences were clustered into longer viral genome segments. We first used PHRAP [46] with highly stringent parameters (<qual_show 20>, <confirm_length 50>, <confirm_score 100>, <minscore 180>, and <maxgap 0>), and generated 2,553 unique viral genome sequence segments that included 257 contigs and 2,296 singletons from Lib 1, 4,958 (708 contigs and 4,250 singletons) from Lib 2, and 3,546 (405 contigs and 3,141 singletons) from Lib 3. The PHRAP-generated unique viral sequence segments were further clustered using the Sequencher program with the parameters of a minimum of 40 bp overlap and greater than 95% nucleotide identity, which resulted in 1,109 (297 contigs and 812 singletons), 1,746 (409 contigs and 1,337 singletons), and 1,184 (270 contigs and 914 singletons) unique viral sequence segments for Lib 1, 2, and 3, respectively.Phylogenetic analysis of PMMV sequences ::: Materials and MethodsThe PMMV CP gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. There are 21 known PMMV CP gene sequences available in GenBank. From the three libraries, 44 assembled fecal PMMV sequence segments were aligned within the first 101 bp of the 474 bp CP gene (from 5,685 to 6,158 bp of the PMMV genome). ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) was used for phylogenetic comparison of these sequences, and TreeView (Win32) was used to generate the phylogram tree (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod.html).RT-PCR detection of fecally borne RNA viruses ::: Materials and MethodsApproximately 20 g of each fecal sample was diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized for 1 min at medium speed in a Stomacher 400 (Seward, Thetford, Norfolk, UK) [47,48]. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min to sediment particulate matter, and the supernatant was subjected to nucleic acid extraction using the Qiagen viral RNA Mini kit. Approximately 100 ng of fecal RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using virus-specific reverse primers (Table 5). The reverse transcription reaction was performed using SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The RT products (1/10 of total reaction) were used as templates for PCR reactions using virus-specific primer pairs (Table 5) and amplifying for 35 cycles. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The identities of all PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. All RT-PCR tests included RNA-less and RT-less samples as negative controls.RT-PCR detection of fecally borne RNA viruses ::: Materials and MethodsFood samples analyzed in this study were subjected to the same procedure for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of PMMV.TaqMan assay for quantification of PMMV ::: Materials and MethodsTo determine the copy number of PMMV in fecal and food samples, a TaqMan assay was used to quantify the viral load in these samples according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, the assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of fecal RNA, five units of MuLV reverse transcriptase, eight units of recombinant RNase inhibitor, 10 μl of 2× universal PCR Master Mix with no UNG (Applied Biosystems), 0.9 μM primers (PMMV-FP1 and PMMV-RP1; Table 5), and 0.2 μM probe (PMMV-Probe1; Table 5). The real-time RT-PCR reactions were carried out in an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The RT reaction was performed at 48 °C for 30 min, followed by 10 min at 95 °C for activation of DNA polymerase, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Negative controls (RT-less and RNA-less) and serial dilutions of positive control (a plasmid clone) were included in every PCR assay.Infection of plants with fecally borne viruses ::: Materials and MethodsTwo PMMV-positive fecal samples (10 g) were resuspended in 10 ml of SM buffer, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the bacteria and large debris, and the supernatants were mixed with ground glass. Two healthy Hungarian wax pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants were used for the test, and two leaves per plant were inoculated with 2 μl of the sample supernatant/ground glass mixture with gentle grinding followed by rinsing with sterile water. The inoculated leaves were then monitored visually over a period of 2 wk, and photos were taken with a digital camera to document viral infection symptoms. The leaves that developed viral symptoms were collected for RNA extraction and viral detection by RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing analysis. Negative controls of five plants were subjected to the same inoculation procedure, with the exception of the fecal supernatant addition."
Evaluation of potential reference genes in real-time RT-PCR studies of Atlantic salmon,"In real-time RT-PCR, the expression levels of the target genes of interest are estimated on the basis of endogenous controls. Various housekeeping genes, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and total RNA are most commonly used as references in gene expression analysis today. The purpose of these controls is to remove or reduce differences due to sampling, i.e. differences in RNA quantity and quality. The ideal endogenous control should be expressed at a constant level among different tissues of an organism, at all stages of development and should be unaffected by the experimental treatment. It should also be expressed at roughly the same level as the RNA under study [1]. However, data normalization in real-time RT-PCR remains a real problem, especially for absolute quantification [1]. Numerous studies have revealed that no single universal gene has a constant expression level under all developmental or experimental situations. The best choice of reference gene to use as an endogenous control varies, depending on the tissues of interest in the experiment. A large number of genes have for this reason been selected for normalization of mRNA expression data [2,3]. If the selected reference gene fluctuates randomly between samples, small differences in expression between the genes of interest will be missed. Gene expression coefficient of variation (CV) between different groups of individuals should ideally be as low as possible [4]. In general, the stability of several potential reference genes should be tested in every examined tissue or cell, and under different experimental design [5,6]. An increasing number of papers are discussing the selection of reference genes in real-time RT-PCR analyses [3,7].BackgroundTwo of the most commonly used reference genes are those encoding glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-actin. Recently, the use of these two genes as endogenous controls has been scrutinized, and several studies have documented that the GAPDH and β-actin genes should be used with caution as controls [2,8,9]. GAPDH in mammals is known to play a role in a broad range of cellular mechanisms (for review see Sirover [10]), including being a key enzyme in glycolysis. Overall, GAPDH mRNA levels might be regulated under a large number of physiological states, and its use as a reference is inappropriate for most experimental conditions. Actin is a major component of the protein scaffold that supports the cell and determines its shape, and is the most abundant intracellular protein in eukaryotic cells. Even though commonly used as a reference, the application of the β-actin gene has recently been characterized as a historical carryover from northern blots and conventional RT-PCR (for a general discussion on the use of 'classic' reference genes like GAPDH and β-actin, see Huggett et al. [7]). Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, formerly elongation factor 1 alpha) plays an important role in translation by catalyzing GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome. However, the protein is involved in a broad diversity of functions and constitutes 1–3% of the total cytoplasmic protein content of the cell. In human, cDNAs of two actively transcribed isoforms have been cloned (eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2) (for review see Thornton et al. [11]). Two paralog EF1A genes (A and B) have recently been applied as references in real-time qRT-PCR of Atlantic salmon [12]. It is plausible to assume that the presence of these highly similar genes is a result of a tetraploidization event that occurred in a salmonid ancestor in the comparatively recent past [13,14].BackgroundPreviously, the 18S rRNA gene was considered to be an ideal internal control in qRT-PCR analysis (Ambion [15]). Ribosomal RNA constitutes up to 80–90% of total cellular RNA, and several studies have shown that rRNA varies less under conditions that affect the expression of mRNAs (discussed in Bustin & Nolan [16]). However, questions have been raised against the use of ribosomal RNA genes as references. Vandesompele et al. [5] have stressed the fact that there sometimes might be imbalances in rRNA and mRNA fractions between different samples, making genes encoding ribosomal RNAs unsuitable as references. To meet these challenges of accurate interpretation of real-time qRT-PCR data, the authors suggested that an index of the most stable housekeeping genes should be used for normalization, and developed the geNorm VBA applet for Microsoft Excel in this regard [5]. A similar software tool, the BestKeeper, has been developed by Pfaffl et al. [6]. These tools can be used to find the most stable reference genes under different experimental conditions. We used the geNorm software which determines the individual stability of a gene within a pool of genes [5]. The stability is calculated according to the similarity of their expression profile by a pair-wise comparison, using their geometric mean as a normalizing factor. The gene with the highest M, i.e. the least stable gene, is then suggested excluded in a stepwise fashion until the most stable genes are determined, and an index suggested, based on the best genes. geNorm has been used to select the most stable reference genes in several recent studies (e.g. [4,17,18]).BackgroundThe aim of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of six potential reference genes in the Atlantic salmon. Salmonid fish are among the most widely studied model fish species in general, and extensive basic information on many different aspects of their biology has been collected [19]. Large-scale DNA-sequencing projects on salmon have been initiated in several laboratories ; ; ; . In this work we selected the two 'classic' reference genes encoding GAPDH and β-actin, two genes encoding 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1AA and EF1AB). To evaluate their usefulness as reference genes, RNA from eight tissues of six adult salmon were subjected to real time PCR. The relative transcription levels of the genes were also estimated in four phases of young salmon going through smoltification, in order to check their stabilities under physiological stressful conditions.Ranking of six potential reference genes in Atlantic salmon ::: Results and discussionThe ranking of the six examined genes analyzed by geNorm is shown in Table 3. In six tissues (muscle, liver, gills, head kidney, spleen and thymus), the EF1AB gene emerged as the most stable, whereas the EF1AA gene was ranked number one in brain and the β-actin gene was ranked number one in intestine. The 18S rRNA and S20 genes were ranked among the worse genes in all tissues. Not surprisingly, the GAPDH gene was ranked worse in five tissues (liver, head kidney, spleen, brain and thymus), confirming the general skepticism against the use of this gene as reference [7,16,20]. Combined, the total ranking reads EF1AB>EF1AA>β-actin>18S rRNA>S20>GAPDH. We did not analyze our data with the Bestkeeper software. Analyzing reference genes in virus infected cells, Radonic et al. [4] concluded that the Bestkeeper tool gave results that slightly deviated from, but nevertheless corresponded to, those obtained using geNorm.Ranking of six potential reference genes in Atlantic salmon ::: Results and discussionTo be able to evaluate gene stability under stressful conditions, mRNA expression of the selected genes was examined in gills of salmon going through smoltification. Prior to seawater entry, juvenile anadromous salmon undergo a parr-smolt transformation, characterized by behavioral, morphological and physiological changes, known to be challenging for the fish. Physiological alterations include increased seawater tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth and changed hemoglobin and visual pigments [21]. We selected to examine the gills during smoltification, because this tissue plays a major role in ionic and osmotic regulation during adaptation to hyperosmotic seawater. Figure 1 shows the raw Ct values of the studied genes in gills before, during and after smoltification (smoltified in seawater and desmoltified in freshwater). In Figure 2 the same data are presented, but now normalized against an index calculated by geNorm of the three most stable genes (β-actin, EF1AA and EF1AB). Based on the M values, geNorm ranks the stability of the six genes from 24 fish going through smoltification in the following order: EF1AB>EF1AA>β-actin>S20>18S rRNA>GAPDH (Figure 3). In Figure 1 it can be seen that the 18S gene had the lowest individual raw Ct variation. Most individual raw Ct variation of the studied genes is seen in the presmolt and smolt groups. A characteristic drop in expression can be seen for all genes in the smolt group, compared to the presmolt group. After transfer to seawater, the individual raw Ct variation decreased for all genes. Overall, the raw Ct data suggest that the physiological challenging smoltification process affected the expression of all six genes. When the same data were normalized against an index of the three most stable genes, β-actin, EF1AA and EF1AB, the relative expression levels were altered for all genes. Now the ribosomal 18S gene emerges as the second worse, whereas the two paralog EF1A genes became the most stable. This might have to do with the fact that geNorm will top-rank co-expressed genes [22], a weakness that has to be considered when evaluating paralog genes likely to be co-regulated. Even though the eEF1A-2 gene has been identified as an important oncogene and has been shown to be differently expressed in human tissues [11], Hamalainen et al. [23] found the eEF1A-1 gene to be a good reference gene in real-time RT-PCR examinations. A similar finding was reported by Frost and Nilsen [24] in salmon louse, where they showed that the eEF1A and S20 genes were valid candidate references, whereas the 18S rRNA and GAPDH genes were unsuitable. The current findings based on geNorm evaluation question the recommended application of ribosomal genes as references (as suggested for example by Ambion (see reference [15]), and are in line with earlier warnings against the use of rRNA genes as references [5,6]. To avoid the normalization of the genes for β-actin, EF1AA and EF1AB against an index partly based on their own expression, the S20 gene was included in the index instead, and the mean normalized expression for these three genes calculated with the new index. The patterns of expression, however, were approximately the same for the three genes as seen in Figure 2, suggesting that the gene-stability measure M can be used to find the most appropriate reference genes.PCR poisoning ::: Results and discussionWe see a correlation between the A260/230 absorbance on the NanoDrop and the PCR efficiency (data not shown). We tend to get PCR efficiencies that are too high in some samples with low A260/230 ratios. When the samples are treated with DNase solution, the A260/230 ratio usually drops. After DNase treatment, the A260/280 ratio increased from 1.8 to 2.1 (n = 45 samples). At the same time, the A260/230 ratio dropped from 2.4 to 2.1. The DNase treatment therefore adds substances to the RNA solution that increases the absorbance at 230 nm more than it decrease the 260 nm absorbance. The added substance (salt or some other component) may inhibit the RT reaction or the PCR reaction, sometimes called PCR poisoning. We have seen that the A260/230 ratios are quite low in samples that give inadequate PCR efficiency slopes, especially with RNA from head kidney, thymus and intestine tissues, in which the gradient of the standard curve is less than -3.3 (Table 2). The reason one obtain better amplification rate efficiencies with the more diluted samples is because the inhibitor has been diluted below its effective level. The obvious way around this problem is to dilute the amount of cDNA put into the PCR reaction. Alternatively, cleanup columns can be used to purify and concentrate the RNA.PCR poisoning ::: Results and discussionTranscription levels of the examined genes and the coefficient of variance (CV) in different tissues varied considerably. mRNA levels in tissues are regulated by numerous endogenous and exogenous stimuli [16]. Transcription rates in metabolic active tissues might be up-regulated compared to those of less active tissues, whereas inter-tissue variation in degradation rates of mRNAs, for example, might affect mRNA stability [25]. The results revealed that muscle had the lowest CVs of the studied genes, compared to higher CVs in more active tissues like thymus, head kidney and spleen. In thymus, intestine, head kidney, gills, brain, liver and spleen, the 18S and S20 genes had the lowest CVs, based on raw Ct values. In all tissues, except intestine, the GAPDH gene had the highest CV. Except for thymus, the two elongation factor genes had relatively similar expression in all eight examined tissues. Their expression are most likely co-expressed in the examined tissues, and therefore favored in geNorm calculations [22]. The results also demonstrated that assays optimized for one tissue of an organism do not necessarily work equally well in other tissues. Of the tissues studied in this work, intestine, head kidney and spleen were the most troublesome.ConclusionOur data, based on geNorm calculations, suggest that the Atlantic salmon EF1A genes that have been tested in the present study may be good candidate reference genes. The GAPDH gene seems unsuitable as a reference in quantitative real-time RT-PCR. With regard to the 18S rRNA gene, this must be applied with caution. Tools like the geNorm applet for Microsoft Excel can be useful to help select the most stable genes in various experiments.Fish handling and experimental design ::: MethodsTissues from 15 individuals were collected (852 ± 702 g, ranging from 254 to 1898 g). These individuals were not separated based on sex, size or sampling time, but treated as one heterogeneous group to examine the width of mRNA expression of the studied genes in eight different organs. This group of fish was handled and fed according to normal aquacultural management, and none of these individuals were exposed to any particular treatment. To examine if physiological stress may alter the gene expression in the gills, a total of 24 individuals were collected before (termed presmolt, 18.3 ± 0.9 g), during (termed smolt, 28.7 ± 3.7 g) and after smoltification. After smoltification, one group was kept and desmoltified in freshwater (termed desmolt FW, 30.0 ± 3.8 g), while the other group was transferred to seawater (termed smoltified SW, 30.2 ± 4.3 g) (n = 6 in each group). The Atlantic salmon examined during smoltification were from the anadromous population ""Vosso"" of the river Vosso in Southwestern Norway (see Nilsen et al. [27] for details on how these fish were treated). All fish were treated and euthanized according to Norwegian national legislation for laboratory animals.Tissue sampling ::: MethodsSamples from eight organs, i.e. gills, liver, brain, head kidney, spleen, thymus, white muscle and posterior intestine, were dissected out and immediately frozen in cryo tubes in liquid N and stored at -80°C before RNA extraction. The RNA extracted from three spleen and four head kidney tissue samples were of low quality, and we had to redo the sampling from four individuals, These tissue samples were stored on RNA later (Ambion) at -20°C before further processing.RNA extraction ::: MethodsRNA was isolated with phenol-chloroform extraction as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi [28], and stored in 100 μl RNase-free MilliQ H2O. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was eliminated from the samples by DNase treatment according to the manufacturer's description (Ambion). The RNA was then stored at -80°C before further processing. The quality of the RNA was assessed with the NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.8 – 2.0 indicates a pure RNA sample. The RNA 6000 Nano LabChip® kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the integrity of the RNA. We used the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit from Qiagen to purify our most troublesome samples. With this kit the A260/230 ratio increased on average by 5 % (n = 10).Design of PCR primers and TaqMan probes ::: MethodsThe PCR primer and TaqMan MGB probe sequences used for quantification of the genes encoding 18S rRNA, S20 ribosomal protein, β-actin, GAPDH, EF1AA and EF1AB, are shown in Table 1. Four of these genes, 18S, β-actin, EF1AA and EF1AB, have also been used as references in real-time RT-PCR analyses of Atlantic salmon in other recent studies [12,28]. The primers amplify PCR products between 57–98 basepairs (bp) long, which is within the range of 50–150 bp as suggested by Applied Biosystems for their TaqMan assays. qPCR assays were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to select appropriate primer and probe sequences from known Atlantic salmon genes. The mRNA sequences encoding S20 ribosomal protein and GAPDH were obtained from GenBank accession numbers BG936672 and BU693999, respectively (exon-exon borders were not considered). The EF1AA assay was based on a cDNA clone that we reported to the GenBank previously (AF321836), whereas the EF1AB assay was based on the EST BG933853. An alignment with zebrafish indicated the exon-exon borders [29]. The chosen primers were subsequently used to confirm that the salmon genes contained an intron between the same sites as deduced from the alignment with zebrafish. The PCR products containing the introns were cloned into TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (sequences can be provided upon request). PCR primers for β-actin were based on Atlantic salmon BG933897 and designed to span exon-exon borders of this gene, as deduced from corresponding genes in human and zebrafish (NW633959). For 18S rRNA the PCR primers and probe were designed from the Atlantic salmon sequence AJ427629, and placed in a conserved region of the gene based on comparison with the human gene. RNA samples were subjected to DNase treatment to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Amplified PCR products of all actual cDNAs were sequenced to ensure that the correct mRNA sequences were quantified. The fragments were sequenced with BigDye version 3.1 fluorescent chemistry (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI PRISM® 377 DNA apparatus at the University of Bergen Sequencing Facility.Real-time quantitative RT-PCR ::: MethodsA two-step real-time RT-PCR protocol was developed to measure the mRNA levels of the studied genes in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon. The RT reactions were run in triplicate on 96-well reaction plates with the GeneAmp PCR 9700 machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagent containing Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase (50 U/μl). Two-fold serial dilutions of total RNA were made for efficiency calculations. Five or six serial dilutions (500 – 15,63 ng) were analyzed by qRT-PCR in separate sample wells and the resulting Cts recorded. Input total RNA concentration was 500 ng in each reaction for β-actin, GAPDH, EF1AA and EF1AB, and 0.5 ng for 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein. Controls for no template (ntc) and controls for no amplification (nac) were run for each master mix, but not for every single sample. Reverse transcription was performed at 48°C for 60 min by using oligo dT primers (2.5 μM) for β-actin, GAPDH, EF1AA and EF1AB and random hexamer primers (2.5 μM) for 18S and S20 in 30 μl total volume. cDNA for evaluation of smoltification effects (24 samples) were primed entirely with random nonamer primers. In this material, total RNA were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) and cDNA reversely transcribed using 500 ng total RNA and random nonamers in conjunction with the Reverse Transcription Core kit (EuroGenTech, RT-RTCK-05) following the manufacturer's instructions. Input total RNA concentration was 500 ng in each reaction. All 24 samples for each gene were run on the same plate together with six serial dilutions. The final concentration of the other chemicals in each RT reaction was: MgCl2 (5.5 μM), dNTP (500 μM of each), 10× TaqMan RT buffer (1×), RNase inhibitor (0.4 U/μl) and Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase (1.67 U/μl).Real-time quantitative RT-PCR ::: Methods2.5 μl of 10-fold diluted cDNA for β-actin, GAPDH, EF1AA and EF1AB, and 1000-fold diluted cDNA for 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein from each RT reaction was transferred to a new 96-well reaction plate, and the real-time PCR run on the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System from AB. Real-time PCR was performed by using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, which contains AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase, and gene specific primers (900 nM). Fluorescence marked TaqMan MGB probes (200 nM) were used for data collection during the log linear phase of the reaction. PCR was achieved with a 10 min activation and denaturation step at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C. Baseline and threshold for Ct calculation were set automatically with the ABI Prism 7000 SDS software version 1.1, or set manually whenever necessary.Real-time quantitative RT-PCR ::: MethodsFor evaluation of the potential reference genes, raw Ct values are presented. The geNorm VBA applet for Microsoft Excel was used to determine the most stable genes from the set of tested genes [5]. The Ct values were transformed to quantities using standard curves, according to the geNorm manual. The gene expression stability (M) was calculated with the geNorm applet, and the genes were ranked from best to worst, based on the M value.Statistics ::: MethodsThe GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for the statistical analyses in this work. Linear regression was used to determine PCR efficiency based on dilution curves. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare differences among four groups of salmon going through smoltification.Authors' contributionsPAO was responsible for the experiment, data analysis and drafted the manuscript. KKL conducted the real-time RT-PCR analysis, and contributed throughout the experimental process. AEOJ constructed the qPCR assays for two of the genes. TON provided the cDNA from the smoltification experiment. IH participated as a supervisor in the study design, analyses and writing."
Selection of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in bovine preimplantation embryos,"Preimplantation bovine embryo development is characterized by distinct biological steps, including first cleavage division, activation of the embryonic genome, compaction and blastocyst formation with the derivation of two different cell lines, the inner cell mass and the trophectodermal cells. These processes are regulated by differential expression of developmentally important genes, mostly expressed in a stage- and time-dependent manner following the common maternal and/or embryonic expression pattern [1]. The acquisition of knowledge about the physiological timetable of gene expression during preimplantation development is crucial for a better understanding of mammalian embryo development and is useful for further refinement of assisted reproductive technology in mammals [2].BackgroundUntil recently, most studies of oocyte and embryo physiology were based on microscopic observations, but it is commonly agreed that the evaluation of embryo morphology alone does not answer most of the questions [3]. New insights into preimplantation development were gained through the measurement of differential mRNA levels in oocytes and preimplantation embryos by Reverse Transcription (RT-) PCR methods [4-7] that replace less sensitive and more laborious methods like Northern blot analysis and RNase protection assay. However due to differential reaction efficiencies and kinetics in RT-PCR, the amount of final product after amplification may not accurately reflect the initial sample mRNA concentration [8].BackgroundReal-time RT-PCR assays in which data are accurately normalized, are significantly less variable than commonly used conventional RT-PCR procedures. Real-time quantification at the exponential phase is not affected by any reaction components becomming limited in the plateau phase. Although small differences in transcript levels can be measured by endpoint RT-PCR, a lot of optimizations and post-PCR manipulations are required. These optimizations have to be performed for every individual sample, because the RNA expression can vary a lot between individual samples. Therefore, real-time RT-PCR has been recognised as the method of choice for accurate and sensitive quantification of mRNA transcripts [9,10]. Many studies have now been published where RNA quantification has been assessed in early domestic animal embryos. This technique has the advantage of speed, high throughput and accuracy over a large dynamic range of quantification and is especially suitable when only a small number of cells are available [11]. Several authors [12-14] have demonstrated the reproducibility of the 2 step SYBR Green I real-time RT-PCR reaction by determination of the intra- and interassay variation.BackgroundHowever, a lack of standards, variation in assay design, diversity of protocols, instruments and analysis methods make that real-time qRT-PCR results should be treated with caution and that agreed standards and operating procedures are required [15].BackgroundSeveral variables need to be controlled for gene-transcription analysis, such as the amount of starting material, enzymatic efficiencies, and differences between tissues or cells in overall transcriptional activity. Many methods are used to control some of these these variables, for example normalization against the total cell number, against the mass of the input material or against the RNA mass quantity. Exogenously added mRNA or spikes can be used for standardization when the spike is added before the RNA extraction [16].BackgroundNormalization against internal control genes is most frequently used because it can control all variables. Those internal control genes, also known as reference genes, are often referred to as housekeeping genes, assuming that those genes are expressed at a constant level in certain tissues, at all stages of development and are unaffected by the experimental treatment. To date most of the standardizations are done to reference genes such as β-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) or 18S rRNA. However a number of studies have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels are not constant between different developmental stages and different experimental conditions [17-19]. Normalization of the data using these types of apparent controls can result in false conclusions being made regarding transcription levels. Therefore, validation of candidate reference genes is critical for accurate analysis of gene expression [20].BackgroundMost experiments include only a single reference gene. Vandesompele et al. [21] demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relative large errors and they validated the geometric mean of multiple carefully selected reference genes as an accurate normalization factor.BackgroundIn this study, we determined the mRNA expression levels of 8 commonly used reference genes at different preimplantation stages and calculated a normalization factor based on multiple control genes for more accurate and reliable normalization of gene-expression data in bovine preimplantation embryos.Sample quality ::: ResultsFor each assay, embryos with good morphological characteristics [22] were selected from 3 different in vitro embryo production (IVP) experiments. The mean percentage of obtained embryos from all cultivated oocytes at the different developmental stages were 65 ± 6% for the 2-cell stage, 44 ± 5% for the 8-cell stage, 25 ± 4% for the blastocyst stage and 16 ± 3% for the hatched blastocyst stage. Because IVP is time consuming and only a restricted amount of fertilized oocytes develop to the desired embryonic stages, the number of assays was restricted to 3.Sample quality ::: ResultsTotal RNA was isolated from pools of 20 embryos per assay and for each examined developmental stage. Because of the very small cell numbers used for RNA extraction, the RNA quantity could not be measured by the BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Leuven) or the Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer.Sample quality ::: ResultsA minus RT control demonstrated the presence of a considerable amount of contaminating genomic DNA. This illustrated the necessity of a DNase treatment, which removed all the contaminating genomic DNA from the RNA samples.Sample quality ::: ResultsAlthough the RNA quality and quantity could not be determined, a real-time PCR with the reference gene GAPD gave cycle threshold (Ct) values in the range of 23 to 27 and a single band on agarose gel. This first-strand cDNA was 2.5 times diluted with 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and used for further real-time applications.Transcription profiling of the reference genes ::: ResultsAn initial screening of the transcription profiles of the selected reference genes by RT-PCR showed that all of those genes were expressed across the preimplantation embryo stages of interest. None of the eight selected genes was excluded from the study.Transcription profiling of the reference genes ::: ResultsGene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melt-curve analysis and a single band with the expected size in agarose gel electrophoresis. No primer-dimer formation was detected and the identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing (Table 1).Transcription profiling of the reference genes ::: ResultsFor all genes studied, standard curves derived from 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA gave correlation coefficients greater than 0.97 and efficiencies greater than 90%. The reaction efficiencies were used to transform the Ct-values into raw data for analysis with the geNorm software [21].Transcription profiling of the reference genes ::: ResultsThree identical real-time qPCR assays were performed. In each assay the transcription levels of the selected reference genes were measured in duplicate, at 4 different stages of preimplantation development.Transcription profiling of the reference genes ::: ResultsTo compare the RNA transcription levels across the stages of embryonic development, the Ct values were compared. The Ct-value is defined as the number of cycles needed for the fluorescence signal to reach a specific threshold level of detection and is inversely correlated with the amount of template nucleic acid present in the reaction [23]. Most of the genes had Ct values in the range of 25 to 33 but 18S rRNA was more abundant (Ct levels <15).GeNorm analysis ::: ResultsAnalysis of the gene expression stability over the different embryonic stages was done using the geNorm software. The ranking of the 8 control genes according to their M value was equivalent between the 3 assays. GAPD, YWHAZ, SDHA and 18S rRNA were the 4 most stable genes in each of the 3 assays, only the order of the genes was different. ACTB was the least stable gene in the 3 assays. The results are listed in Table 2.GeNorm analysis ::: ResultsTo ensure comparability between the 3 assays, we compared the Ct values and efficiencies of the relative standard curves, derived from the same pooled cDNA stock, between the three independent assays and made a correction for the plate-to-plate variation according to the qBase algorithm (Hellemans et al., in preparation) [24]. This correction factor for inter-assay variation was necessary for the determination of the most stable reference gene over the 3 assays together. The results of the geNorm analysis of the combined assay are shown in Figure 1A. The ranking of the genes in this combined assay is in agreement with the ranking of the 3 individual assays.GeNorm analysis ::: ResultsTo determine how many reference genes should be used, normalization factors (NFn), based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the n best reference genes, were calculated by stepwise inclusion of an extra, less stable reference gene according to Vandesompele et al. [21]. Figure 1B shows the pairwise variation Vn/Vn+1 between 2 sequential normalization factors NFn and NFn+1. A large variation means that the added gene has a significant effect and should probably be included for calculation of the normalization factor. In this case, the inclusion of a 4th gene has no significanf effect (low V3/4 value) on the NF. The 3 member set GAPD, SDHA and YWHAZ is an excellent choice for the calculation of the NF.DiscussionAnalysis of expression patterns of genes essential in early embryo development, provides a useful tool to assess the normality of the embryos and a tool to optimize assisted reproduction technologies [25]. New insights into early embryo development of mammals are commonly gained through the measurement of different mRNA levels by real-time qPCR. This technique has revolutionized the quantification of mRNA but requires careful assay design and reaction optimization to maximize sensitivity, accuracy and precision [26].DiscussionThe problem of measuring transcript levels throughout preimplantation development is confounded by the fact that cell numbers and cell sizes are constantly changing during this developmental interval. Untill the maternal-zygotic transition, the mRNA is mainly of maternal origin. Once the genome is activated, the cell number will influence the amount of mRNA available [3]. To allow ontogenic analysis, the embryos were compared as a single unit and the reference genes will correct for the differences between the embryos.DiscussionUsing in vitro culture, another variable that must be taken into account is the proportion of normal embryos in the sample. Incompetent embryos may be mixed with competent embryos during the analysis [3]. The gene expression in incompetent embryos may be different from those in competent embryos and could introduce a bias [27-29]. As such, there might be an influence of abnormal embryos on the choice of reference genes when using single embryo samples. Therefore we used groups of 20 pooled embryos with good morphological characteristics to minimize the influence of the quality of the individual embryo.DiscussionRNA quality and quantity are critical for succesful gene expression analysis. Due to the limited amount, RNA analysis was not possible, but an RNA extraction method optimized for small sample quantities, DNase treatment and appropriate control methods resulted in as reliable as possible results.DiscussionCritical to the successful application of real-time qPCR is the prevention of amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, resulting in an overestimation of the amount of RNA present. But even more importantly, yielding unreliable data especially for low abundant single exon genes or genes with retropseudogenes in the genome. Minus RT-controls before and after the DNAse treatment demonstrated the necessity and efficacy of the DNase treatment.DiscussionWhen intercalating dyes such as SYBR green I are used, attention should be paid to the formation of primer-dimers. Melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that the fluorescent signal was specifically from the desired amplicons, not from artefacts.DiscussionAccurate normalization is required to correct real-time data for differences in cellular input, RNA quality and enzymatic efficiency between the samples. Under controlled conditions of reproducable extraction of good-quality RNA, the gene transcript number is ideally standardized to the number of cells [21]. During the bovine preimplantation period the cell numbers and cell size are constantly changing. Comparing mRNA levels within the same developmental stage is feasible but doing ontogenic analyses, which are essential to understand transitions in gene expression, is more problematic [3].DiscussionAnother way of normalization is using the mass of the input material. However, in our case it was impossible to quantify those parameters because only minimal amounts of RNA were available and the total amount of RNA present throughout the preimplantation period is not constant. So normalization to total RNA requires a reliable RNA quantification method, and fails to take into account the variability of the RT-reaction. Probably the strongest argument against the use of total RNA mass for normalization is the fact that it predominantly consists of rRNA molecules and is not always representative of the mRNA fraction [21].DiscussionThe addition of exogenously added mRNA can only be used when the exact amount of cells or starting material is known [16]. Spikes only correct for differences in enzymatic efficiencies but do not account for the quality and quantity of the input sample. Therefore, the use of spikes is not assumption free.DiscussionIt is now generally accepted that transcription levels should be normalized to an invariable internal control gene. Those reference genes are often adapted from the literature and used against a variety of experimental conditions. An ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level among different experimental conditions and at all stages of development. An ontogenic study of several commonly used reference genes showed that their mRNA levels are not stable throughout preimplantation development [19]. If the used reference gene fluctuates between the samples, the subsequent normalization will cause erroneous results [30]. As the biological function of many genes is still unknown, it is difficult to predict how experimental conditions will affect the expression of the putative reference genes. Thus a safer approach is to use the geometric average expression of several genes that show small variance. Vandesompele et al. [21] postulated that gene pairs that have stable expression patterns relative to each other are proper control genes. YWHAZ, GAPD, SDHA and 18S rRNA were found to be the best endogenous control genes in preimplantation embryo samples as represented by their low M values, the marker of gene stability. ACTB was the worst scoring reference gene, in the set of 8 tested reference genes (Figure 1A). This is a remarkable result given the fact that in several publications on gene expression analysis in embryos, ACTB was the only reference gene used. However, the differential mRNA expression of ACTB is in accordance with previous reports that prove the upregulation of ACTB during preimplantation embryo development and predict a role for ACTB during blastocyst formation [31-33]. In previous studies Histone H2A was determined as the most stable reference gene during preimplantation embryo development [8,19], but those authors only considered Ct values and did not correct for the amount of input material. To validate the presumed stable expression of a given control gene, prior knowledge of a reliable measure to normalize this gene in order to remove any nonspecific variation is required. To address this circular problem, Vandesompele et al. [21] developed a gene-stability measure to determine the expression stability of control genes on the basis of non-normalized expression levels. By using this approach, the changing RNA content during the developmental stages was taken into account [34]. Besides geNorm, other programs and strategies are described in literature to select the best reference genes. BestKeeper [35] is an Excel-application also based on pairwise correlation. Normfinder [13] is a model based approach and enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes, but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set.DiscussionA normalization factor (NF) based on the geometric mean of the best performing reference genes was calculated. The number of genes used to calculate this NF is a trade-off between practical considerations and accuracy. In this case, the 3 most stable reference genes were used to calculate the normalization factor (NF3). Figure 1B demonstrates that the inclusion of a 4th reference gene has no significant contribution to the newly calculated normalization factor NF4.DiscussionUltimately, our choice for the normalizing set is the geometric mean of the transcription levels of GAPD, SDHA and YWHAZ. 18S rRNA was excluded because rRNA genes have general disadvantages when used as reference genes. Their transcription is carried out by RNA polymerase I, therefore the regulation of rRNA synthesis is independent from mRNA synthesis, which is carried out by RNA polymerase II [36]. Besides, rRNA genes are highly abundant compared to the target mRNA transcripts, this imbalance makes it difficult to accurately subtract the baseline values in real-time qPCR analysis [21]. 18S rRNA was evaluated in this study because it is a commonly used reference gene.ConclusionIn conclusion, a method for gDNA free RNA extraction from embryos was optimized and a reference gene assay for reliable normalization of real-time PCR data, obtained from bovine preimplantation embryo samples was designed. Transcription profiling of 8 different reference genes showed that the use of a single reference gene is not reliable and will result in erroneous conclusions. Instead GAPD, SDHA and YWHAZ should be used.In vitro production of bovine embryos ::: MethodsBovine embryos were produced by routine in vitro methods as described by Yuan and colleagues [37]. Briefly, bovine oocytes were obtained from ovaries collected at a local slaughterhouse. Immature cumulus-oocyte complexes were selected from follicular fluid, washed three times in HEPES-TALP and matured for 22 to 26 h in groups of 100 in 500 μl maturation medium at 39°C in a humified 5% CO2 incubator. After maturation the oocytes were inseminated with frozen-thawed sperm of a dairy bull (1 × 106 spermatozoa/ml). The cumulus cells and spermatozoa were mechanically removed from the presumptive zygotes, which were placed in groups of 25 in 50 μl droplets of synthetic oviduct fluid supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and cultured up to the desired stages. The embryos were collected at the indicative time period after fertilization: 2-cell (24–36 h), 8-cell (48–64 h), blastocyst (day 7) and hatched blastocyst (day 8). All embryos were washed three times in PBS, collected in pools of 20 and frozen at -80°C until RNA extraction.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis ::: MethodsTotal RNA was isolated from 20 pooled embryos using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This kit is engineered to recover high-quality total RNA from pico-scale samples.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis ::: MethodsFor genomic DNA removal an in-solution DNase digestion was carried out by treating the total RNA with 2 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega, Leiden) followed by a spin-column purification (Microcon YM-100, Millipore, Brussels). A minus RT control was performed with primers for GAPD to check the removal of all the contaminating genomic DNA.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis ::: MethodsFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total amount of RNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Nazareth), following the manufacturer's instructions. The iScript Reverse Transcriptase is a modified MMLV-derived reverse transcriptase and the iScript Reaction Mix contains both oligo(dT) and random primers. After the RT reaction and RT control with primers for GAPD, the cDNA was 2.5 times diluted in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0.Reference gene selection and primer design ::: MethodsEight reference genes were selected (ACTB, GAPD, Histone H2A, TBP, HPRT1, SDHA, YWHAZ and 18S rRNA) that belong to different functional classes to reduce the chance that the genes might be co-regulated (Table 3).Reference gene selection and primer design ::: MethodsPrimers for Histone H2A were taken from Robert and colleagues [19], primers for TBP were taken from Vigneault and colleagues [38] and primers for ACTB were taken from Fair and colleagues [27]. The other primers were designed by the Primer 3 software [39] and were based on RNA or DNA sequences found in Genbank. The reported bovine sequences were preferentially used and the specificity of the primers was tested using a BLAST analysis against the genomic NCBI database. PCR amplicons were characterized using Mfold [40] in order to predict the nature of any secondary structures which might influence the PCR efficiency. The PCR products were cloned (pCR 2.1 vector, Invitrogen, Merelbeke) and sequenced for verification (Thermo Sequenase Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit, Amersham Bioscience, Roosendaal) with a ALF Express sequencer (Amersham Bioscience, Roosendaal) [GenBank: DQ066891, DQ066892, DQ066893, DQ066894, DQ066895, DQ066896, DQ066897 and DQ066898]. Primer and amplicon information are listed in Table 1.Real-Time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsThree replicates of 20 pooled embryos were used for each developmental stage (2-cell, 8-cell, blastocyst and hatched blastocyst) as described by Robert et al. [19].Real-Time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsAll PCR reactions were performed in a 15 μl reaction volume on the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Nazareth) using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Nazareth), 200 nM of each specific primer and 2.5 μl of diluted cDNA or one embryo equivalent per reaction.Real-Time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsThe PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 3 minutes to activate the Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds and a combined primer annealing/extension at the specific annealing temperature for 40 seconds during which fluorescence was measured. A melt curve was produced to confirm a single gene-specific peak and to detect primer/dimer formation by heating the samples from 70 to 95°C in 0.5°C increments with a dwell time at each temperature of 10 seconds while continuously monitoring the fluorescence. PCR efficiencies were calculated using a relative standard curve derived from a pooled cDNA mixture (a ten-fold dilution series with four measuring points). This pooled cDNA was obtained from bovine heart, kidney, liver, muscle, lung and placenta tissue, using Total RNA Isolation Reagent (TRIR, ABgene, Epsom) for the RNA isolation and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Nazareth) for the RT-reaction.Real-Time quantitative PCR ::: MethodsEach reaction was run in duplicate, whereby a no-template control was included.Determination of reference gene expression stability ::: MethodsTo determine the stability of the selected reference genes, the geNorm Visual Basic application for Microsoft Excel was used as described by Vandesompele et al. [21].Determination of reference gene expression stability ::: MethodsThis approach relies on the principle that the expression ratio of two perfect reference genes should be identical in all samples, regardless of the experimental condition or cell type. Increasing variation in this ratio corresponds to decreasing expression stability. The program calculates the gene stability measure M by determining the average pair-wise variation between a particular reference gene and all other control genes. Genes with higher M values have greater variation in RNA expression. By stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene and recalculation of the M values, the most stable reference genes are identified. Finally, a normalisation factor (NF) was calculated based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the best-performing reference genes.Authors' contributionsKG performed all the experimental procedures and was the primary author of the manuscript.

The New International Health Regulations and the Federalism Dilemma,"Federalism and Public Health ResponseFederalism is a type of political system in which the advantages of shared rule are combined with those of regional government [3]. Countries with federal governments make up about 40% of the world's population, and include the second most populous country (India) and the world's largest economy (United States) [4]. Federal systems of government offer many advantages, including allowing for the distinctiveness of the regions within a nation to be recognized and for region-specific policy approaches to be developed. However, one of the limitations of federations is that the division of powers can create an obstacle to the development of centralized approaches to national challenges. Such scenarios can arise when the country's constitution distributes the key powers in question to the regions. This characteristic of federal systems poses a dilemma when international treaties are signed by a federal government, but the cooperation of regional governments (states, provinces, etc.) is necessary for compliance with the treaty.Federalism and Public Health ResponseCanada's experience with SARS outlines the challenges of such constitutional division of powers when it comes to managing public health crises. During SARS, the Canadian federal government's ability to obtain data from the Province of Ontario was dependent on voluntary transfer, since the management of infectious disease outbreaks falls under provincial jurisdiction [5,6]. Reviews of the response to SARS showed that the transfer of data from the provincial government to the federal government was a key obstacle to the management of the crisis and, in particular, limited the federal government's ability to effectively communicate the status of the outbreak to the WHO (Problem 7 of [7]).Federalism and Public Health ResponseThe United States encountered similar jurisdictional problems when developing strategies to address the threat of bioterrorism following the 2001 anthrax attacks, because public health is primarily within the jurisdiction of the states [8,9]. Concerns about the inadequacy of some state public health legislation at the time provided the impetus for the development of a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act [10].Federalism and Public Health ResponseIn Australia, powers over emergency response to public health crises also primarily reside at the state level, with the federal government having limited authority except for quarantine. The development of a coordinated Australian approach to managing new infectious threats has thus been a challenge, and there is potential for confusion over who has authority in the event of a public health emergency that crosses state borders [11].Federalism and Public Health ResponseAdding to the challenges of developing effective intergovernmental approaches to disease outbreaks in federations is their multidimensional nature. The response to an infectious outbreak could involve issues of national security, emergency response, environmental protection, and food and water safety. Powers over these areas may be differentially allocated across the various orders of government. Such a scenario could produce conflict or confusion when attempting to determine which order of government has the ultimate authority over the management of the outbreak. This in turn may contribute to a failure to adequately manage an outbreak and to the spread of the outbreak across borders within a country, and potentially into other countries.The New International Health RegulationsThe revisions of the IHR create important new challenges to all countries, and in particular to those with federal systems of government (Table 1) [12]. The new IHR require all states parties to designate representatives to implement the surveillance, response, and notification requirements of the regulations. These requirements cover all jurisdictions from the community level to the national level. While the previous version only applied to three infectious diseases, the new IHR apply to “all events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern,” and a decision-making instrument to assist in the identification of such events is included in the regulations. Notifiable events within a state are to be reported by a “national IHR Focal Point” to the WHO within 24 hours. States are also responsible for strengthening their surveillance system and are required to complete both a capacity assessment within two years of the approval of the revised Regulations, and the development of public health infrastructure that ensures full compliance within five years of the entry into force (in June 2007) of the regulations.The New International Health RegulationsThe new IHR also explicitly outline new WHO powers, which include an information-gathering prerogative that is not limited solely to official state notifications or consultations, but which covers all “the available scientific evidence and other relevant information”. The WHO is also empowered to share information with other states parties if an affected state “does not accept the offer of collaboration” and “when justified by the magnitude of the public health risk”. The revisions also formally empower the WHO to issue temporary and standing recommendations if an outbreak is classified as a public health emergency of international concern. These could include recommendations to issue travel restrictions for persons from affected areas. The recommendations would ideally be made with the consent of the affected country, although provisions exist for such action in the absence of the target member state's consent.Federalism and the New International Health RegulationsThe realities of federations, and the fragmentation of powers within them, could become particularly problematic when attempting to operationalize the new IHR. This is particularly true of the surveillance and reporting requirements, and it is of particular concern given the implications of new WHO powers. There is a real concern that federations may not be able to comply with the IHR, which could result in the issuance of temporary recommendations that would penalize federations for political and administrative features that they perceive to be beyond their control.Federalism and the New International Health RegulationsWhile a primarily unitary state may have sufficient centralized powers to ensure that the surveillance and reporting requirements embodied in the new IHR are met, the allocation of powers within federations may not permit this. For example, the IHR revisions require all member nations to notify the WHO “within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory…as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events”. However, federal governments may not have the authority to collect the data necessary for reporting to the WHO and the transfer of data from the affected regions may not occur voluntarily. While, according to the new IHR, the federal government can designate regional representatives to carry out some of the measures, the government is ultimately dependent on cooperation from these regional authorities that may not necessarily be forthcoming.Federalism and the New International Health RegulationsThere are several reasons why regional governments, for example, may not want to provide complete information on the nature of an outbreak. These include concern about the impact of disclosure on their economy, aversion to federal scrutiny, concerns about stigmatization, and a fundamental belief that the issue being addressed is within their jurisdiction. Failure to report could have significant consequences, most importantly the delay of national and international responses to prevent the spread of the disease. The resistance of regional governments to sharing of information could leave a country susceptible to measures introduced by the WHO, particularly since the WHO now has authority to conduct surveillance and to utilize information gathered from nongovernmental sources through the Global Public Health Intelligence Network [13,14].Federalism and the New International Health RegulationsThe issuance of travel advisories, as occurred during SARS, or of temporary recommendations to member nations not to accept travelers from an affected region, could have damaging effects on the economy of that region. The perception in Canada was that the SARS travel advisory may not have been warranted, and had a serious negative impact on the economy of Toronto [15,16]. In developing countries where tourism is essential to the national economy, such an advisory could be catastrophic. Federations could view the use of such measures by the WHO as unnecessarily punitive and an invasion of national sovereignty. Ultimately, this could lead to a lack of support for the WHO, the IHR and other global strategies for disease control [12].Federalism and International AgreementsThe United States, recognizing the challenges the IHR could pose for federations, had requested the insertion of a clause that would acknowledge the unique governance structures of federations. The decision not to include such a clause in the revised IHR prompted the United States to notify that they intend to submit a statement of reservation, specifically commenting that they will “implement the IHR in a manner consistent with (their) federal system of government” [17].Federalism and International AgreementsThe challenges posed by the IHR to federations are not unique, however, as federations are often confronted with difficulties in implementing international agreements. For example, the
GATT/WTO agreement included a federal clause which states that “[e]ach contracting party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure observance of the provisions of this Agreement by the regional and local governments and authorities within its territory”. However, there has been variability in the interpretation of this clause, with certain countries claiming that this requires the use of any constitutional power available to adhere to the agreement, and others arguing that this clause should not allow internal federal structures to be compromised [18,19]. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has generated similar challenges to implementation in federal states, and it is notable that two key federations, the US and Australia, have not ratified the treaty [20].
Federalism and International AgreementsThe problems federations have with compliance with international treaties can occur at several levels. First, as already mentioned, the necessary powers to ensure compliance with a treaty may not fall within the jurisdiction of the federal level of government. While in many federations, the federal power to sign treaties may permit them to override the jurisdiction of regional governments, this is not necessarily always the case. And in scenarios in which the federal government does have the necessary constitutional authority, they may choose not to exercise it because of political concerns about creating conflict with regional governments. Even in scenarios in which the federal government has the necessary legislative power and does choose to exercise it, regional governments may not be able to cope with the financial and/or practical burdens of compliance [21]. This latter issue, of unfunded mandates, is not unique to federal states and constitutes a challenge that all WHO member nations will need to address when determining how to implement the surveillance requirements of the new IHR.Guidance to FederationsIt is apparent that this “federalism dilemma” will need to be addressed, both by member nations and by the WHO, if the revised IHR are to be implemented successfully. It is primarily incumbent upon federations, as responsible members of the international community, to take every measure available to ensure that they can comply with the new IHR. These measures would include using what constitutional means may be available to centralize necessary public health powers concerning surveillance and outbreak response, making efforts to establish effective collaborative intergovernmental arrangements, and developing appropriate public health capacity at the local level. The intergovernmental acrimony to which federations are susceptible would clearly not be acceptable if, at a time of crisis, it produced a dysfunctional response that resulted in the international spread of disease.Guidance to FederationsThe WHO, in turn, must make efforts to assist federations in this regard. These efforts could include the provision of guidelines on strategies federal governments can use to address some of the challenges we have described. For example, the constitutions of some federations may have unexploited powers that federal governments could utilize to gain the necessary authority. Constitutions are often interpreted in a flexible manner by courts, in recognition of the realities of a changing world. The threat of pandemic infections could be taken strongly into consideration when courts are interpreting the use of federal powers. Of course, there are important limitations to this strategy, including the fact that any constitutional interpretation will need to strike a balance between new public health powers and respect for fundamental human rights and traditional allocations of government power, both of which may constrain the expansion of federal authority. Furthermore, heavy-handed, top-down approaches to managing disease outbreaks are not ideal, given the critical importance of local and regional public health activities. Ideally, responses would be a collaborative venture between orders of government.Guidance to FederationsTo facilitate such collaboration, federal governments could enter into agreements with regional governments to ensure cooperation on matters such as the timely and adequate transfer of data. The likelihood of adherence to such agreements would be greatly enhanced if conditional funding were provided by the federal government to assist in developing the necessary surveillance and response infrastructure at the local level. This option is particularly important to consider because adequate federal powers will have no effect in the absence of adequate surveillance infrastructure or public health capacity. Governance strategies must go hand in hand with effective surveillance and the development of necessary public health capacity [22].ConclusionGiven the importance of the IHR revision process, every effort should be made to ensure that member nations can comply with the new requirements. The size and power of several federations in the World Health Organization require that the particular nuances of their governance structure be acknowledged and respected. Failure to do so could threaten the long-term support of the IHR by key federations, such as the United States, India, and Russia, which would undermine their fundamental objective of protecting the global community. Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of federations to make the appropriate adjustments in their approach to public health governance so that they can effectively identify, respond to, and communicate information on disease outbreaks."
Promoter Variation in the DC-SIGN–Encoding Gene CD209 Is Associated with Tuberculosis,"One-third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB). This disease tops the World Health Organization list of deaths due to a single infectious agent, with the death toll between 2 and 3 million people per year [1]. A perplexing, and yet unsolved, feature of TB is that less than 10% of infected individuals develop the disease. Substantial epidemiological evidence supports that host-related factors, such as sex, age, HIV infection, malnutrition, and BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccination, influence the balance between the tubercle bacilli and host immune defences [2,3]. In addition, there is increasing evidence that host genetic factors determine differences in host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection and might contribute therefore to the pattern of clinical disease [4–7]. From a host perspective, the innate immunity system acts as the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens [8]. Initial recognition of pathogens by the innate immunity system is mediated by phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages, through germline-encoded receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors [9]. DCs bear a range of pattern recognition receptors, such as C-type lectins and Toll-like receptors, involved both in recognition of conserved products of microbial metabolism and in the induction of adaptive immunity [8,10–12]. In particular, C-type lectins detect pathogens by their characteristic carbohydrate structures and internalise them for further antigen processing and presentation [13]. We have recently shown that a prototypic C-type lectin, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin), is the major Mycobacterium tuberculosis receptor on human DCs [14]. DC-SIGN is specifically, though not exclusively, expressed on DCs and functions both as a cell adhesion and as a pathogen recognition receptor [15]. As an adhesion receptor, it plays an important role in many DC functions, such as DC-T cell interaction and DC migration [16,17]. Besides its cellular recognition role, DC-SIGN serves as pathogen uptake receptor and mediates interactions with a plethora of pathogens other than M. tuberculosis [18]. Indeed, it has been shown that DC-SIGN allows DCs to capture other bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and certain Klebsiella pneumonia strains, but also viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis-C, dengue, and SARS-coV, and parasites like Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni [19–27]. In addition, recent data suggest that DC-SIGN may mediate intracellular signalling events leading to cytokine secretion and, on this basis, it has been proposed that the lectin could be used by pathogens, including M. tuberculosis, as a part of an immune evasion strategy to their own advantage [28,29].IntroductionIn light of the ability of DC-SIGN to interact with M. tuberculosis and other pathogens, it is plausible that variation in its gene may influence the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases, including TB. We have therefore explored the relationship between CD209 polymorphisms and susceptibility to TB by determining CD209 sequence variation in a cohort of South African Coloured origin.Patients and Methods ::: MethodsThe study was conducted in a cohort of 711 individuals, including 351 TB patients and 360 healthy controls, living in the Cape Town area. Certain suburbs of metropolitan Cape Town have some of the highest reported incidence rates of TB in the world, despite extensive BCG vaccination. Indeed, our study population comes from two suburbs that have been extensively studied because of their uniform ethnicity (known as South African Coloured) and socio-economic status as well as high incidence of TB and low prevalence of HIV [30]. In addition, our study group represents a present-day homogenous population [31] that previously received genetic input from Khoisan, Malaysian, Bantu, and European descent populations [32]. Thus, it represents a community originating from populations with different susceptibilities to TB and offers a unique opportunity to dissect the contributing genetic variants and their probable geographic/ethnic origins. TB patients were bacteriologically-confirmed (smear-positive and/or culture-positive) to present pulmonary tuberculosis. Their mean age (± standard deviation) was 36.7 ± 10.9 y, and 51.8% were male. Controls were unrelated healthy individuals from the same community, with the same socio-economic status, access to health facilities, and chance of diagnosis, and with neither signs nor previous history of TB (mean age 34.6 ± 12.5 y, 22% male). The annual risk of infection in this suburb was estimated at 2.5% in 1987 and at 2.8%–3.5% in 1999, and it is therefore highly likely that, in such an environment, the vast majority of controls have been exposed to M. tuberculosis [33,34]. All subjects were HIV-negative and older than 18 y. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University (South Africa).Laboratory Procedures and Statistical Analysis ::: MethodsTo identify informative CD209 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to avoid ascertainment bias in the choice of markers to be tested, we first sequenced the whole CD209 genomic region (seven coding exons, flanking intronic regions, and 1,000 base pairs situated 5′ of the start codon) in 28 randomly chosen individuals (56 chromosomes). Using polymorphisms with a minimum allele frequency of 0.05, unphased genotypic data were converted into haplotypes using the accelerated EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm implemented in Haploview v3.1 [35]. To evaluate the accuracy of the EM algorithm, haplotype reconstruction was performed in parallel using the Bayesian statistical method [36] implemented in Phase v.2.1.1. Equivalent results were obtained using both methods, with all haplotypes presenting high levels of statistical support. In order to define a minimal number of SNPs explaining most haplotypic diversity, we used the BEST v1.0 software [37]. Eight haplotype-tagging SNPs were then selected to genotype the entire panel of 711 individuals. Further, potential population stratification between cases and controls was tested by genotyping 25 unlinked SNP markers in the entire study cohort. DNA samples were genotyped by either fluorescence polarization (VICTOR-2TM technology; PerkinElmer, Wellesley, California, United States) or TaqMan (ABI Prism-7000 Sequence Detection System; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) assays. Statistical testing for genotypic and haplotypic associations were performed using S
TATA 8.2 and Haploview v3.1, respectively. The haplotype frequencies were obtained by summing the fractional likelihood of each haplotype for each individual (i.e., if a particular individual has been determined to have a 40% likelihood of haplotype A and 60% likelihood of haplotype B, 0.4 and 0.6 would be added to the counts for A and B, respectively) [35].
Results and DiscussionTwo variants located in the CD209 promoter region (−871 A/G and −336 A/G) exhibited a frequency distribution significantly distorted between TB patients and controls, as indicated by a Chi-square test (Table 1). For the −871 variant, genotypes GG and GA were less frequently observed in cases (16.8%) compared to the control group (27.2%) (p = 8.2 × 10−4). For the −336 variant, genotypes GG and GA were more frequent in cases (70.6%) than in controls (61.9%) (p = 0.01). These observations suggest that the alleles −871A (odds ratio [OR]: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.29–2.66) and −336G (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.08–2.02) increase the risk of developing TB in our South African cohort. At the haplotype level (Table 2), a Chi-square test first revealed that the global distribution of haplotype frequencies was significantly different between cases and controls (p = 1.2 × 10−3). One haplotype (H3) turned out to be the main haplotype responsible for such a distorted frequency distribution (Table 2). This haplotype, which contains both −871G and −336A, was found to be strongly associated with the control group (p = 1.6 × 10−3; OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.22–2.38). The associations with this haplotype, and with −871, remained highly significant (p = 1.3 × 10−2 and 6.6 × 10−3 respectively), even after the conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.Results and DiscussionAlthough our cohort is considered a present-day homogeneous community that has received genetic contribution from different populations multiple generations ago [31,32], population stratification between cases and controls can be a confounding factor leading to a spurious positive association. Indeed, the use of admixed populations in association-mapping studies can be very useful to identify disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across parental populations. However, when the admixture event is too recent, allelic frequencies can differ coincidentally among cases and controls, reflecting a nonuniform genetic contribution from the parental populations to each subpopulation (i.e., cases and controls), rather than a genuine association between a given genetic variant and the phenotype under study. In this case, the study-cohort is said to present population stratification. To formally test and quantify the levels of background genetic differences [38], if any, between cases and controls, we genotyped the entire cohort for a panel of 25 independent SNPs markers which are (1) not in linkage disequilibrium with the candidate CD209 locus and with any other known gene, (2) randomly distributed along the genome, and (3) polymorphic among the major ethnic groups (Table 3). The mean χ2 statistic among the 25 SNPs for the comparison of allele frequencies between cases and controls, which represents the levels of stratification (μ) between the two groups [39], was 1.25 (p = 0.26), implying that the two groups were not significantly stratified. As an additional correction for stratification, we divided the χ2 values obtained for our candidate gene CD209 by the level of stratification detected (1.25) [39]. Even after such a conservative correction, the associations observed with −336 and −871 as well as with H3 remained significant (−336 p = 2.8 × 10−2; −871 p = 2.7 × 10−3; H3 p = 4.8 × 10−3). These observations support therefore the idea that the −871G and −336A variants are indeed genuinely associated with a protective role against TB.Results and DiscussionIn order to gain insights into the frequency distribution of these two SNPs, we genotyped them in 254 human chromosomes from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia as well as in eight chimpanzee chromosomes. We observed that the −871G and −336A forms, which we propose as offering protection against TB, corresponded to the derived allele in humans; we also observed that these forms are present at higher frequencies in Eurasians as compared to Africans (Table 4). Indeed, the −871G is absent in African populations whereas it reaches high frequencies (20%–40%) in European and Asian populations. Given the absence of the haplotypic combination of −871G and −336A among sub-Saharan Africans, its presence among South African Coloureds suggests that it was introduced through the historically well-known admixture with Europeans and Asians [31]. This observation highlights the power of using admixed populations to better understand historical issues associated with the geographic/ethnic origin of disease-affecting alleles, provided that their prevalence varies in the ancestors of the admixed population (i.e., different frequency of H3 in Africans versus non-Africans; Table 4).Results and DiscussionIn the context of TB, it has been suggested that present-day susceptibility to TB is determined by previous history of exposure [40]. There is fairly convincing evidence that TB has been endemic in Europe for several hundred years, whereas in Africa it has probably been rare before contact was initiated with Europeans [41–43]. It is expected therefore that M. tuberculosis has exerted stronger selective pressures on European than African populations [42]. Our results lend support to this hypothesis and suggest that the protective alleles −871G and −336A increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of genetic adaptation to a longer period of TB exposure. The potential impact of tuberculosis on the frequency of resistant alleles in European populations has been recently addressed using epidemiological data and statistical modeling [44]. The authors have sought to evaluate the expected changes in resistant allele frequencies, during the 300-y period corresponding to the peak epidemics of TB in Europe. They concluded that if a given resistant allele was at a low frequency in the beginning of an epidemic, selection by M. tuberculosis alone would increase the frequency of this allele, but not enough to bring it to epidemiologically significant levels. In this context, since DC-SIGN is known to interact with a vast range of pathogens, it is indeed likely that the increased frequencies observed today for both −871G and −336A in non-African populations (specially for −871G which is absent in sub-Saharan Africans) may have been driven, not only by the selective pressures imposed by M. tuberculosis, but also by other infectious agents. Indeed, two independent studies have recently reported a genetic association between the −336A variant and protection against parenteral HIV infection [45] and severity of dengue pathogenesis [46]. Although HIV infection, for example, is too recent to have left any signature of selection on CD209, these observations emphasize the possible action of other pathogens in shaping the patterns of variability of this gene.Results and DiscussionFrom a functional point of view, the −336A allele has been shown to affect an Sp1-like binding site and to modulate transcriptional activity in vitro by increasing the levels of expression [46]. In the context of TB, increased DC-SIGN expression levels by DCs may result in better capture and processing of mycobacterial antigens, leading to a stronger and wider T-cell response. In addition, we have recently shown that DC-SIGN expression is markedly induced in alveolar macrophages in active TB patients and that M. tuberculosis is preferentially phagocytosed by DC-SIGN–expressing macrophages in these individuals [47]. Thus, the higher prevalence observed among healthy individuals of the −336A variant, which is associated with increased DC-SIGN expression, may underlie an increased efficiency of host phagocytes, such as DCs and macrophages, to control the infection. In addition to the −336A variant, our genetic data showed a strong association of the −871G allele with healthy controls, suggesting also a functional consequence of this variant that, either alone or in combination with −336A, remains to be defined.Results and DiscussionIn conclusion, the significant association found for the CD209 promoter variants together with their phylogenetic status and frequency distribution strongly suggests that the −871G and −336A alleles may reduce the risk of developing TB. More generally, our results, together with those reporting association of CD209 promoter variants with both HIV susceptibility and dengue pathogenesis [45,46] suggest that variation in this lectin may be of crucial importance in the outcome of a number of infections due to DC-SIGN–interacting pathogens. Detailed in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the functional consequences of CD209 variants on the quality of the host immune response against pathogens, including M. tuberculosis, are now required to eventually develop knowledge-based and effective pathway-targeted treatments."
Time Course and Cellular Localization of SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein and RNA in Lungs from Fatal Cases of SARS,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease that originated in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002, and subsequently spread to Hong Kong in February 2003 [1,2]. Facilitated by busy international traffic, it soon caused major disease outbreaks in multiple cities around the world over the following five months [3,4]. It had an alarming tendency to spread to health care workers, and unlike most respiratory viral infections, predominantly involved the lower respiratory tract. The disease was associated with an unusually high morbidity and mortality; 20%–30% of patients developed severe respiratory symptoms requiring intensive care support [2,3,5]. Worldwide, the average case mortality rate was 10.0%, but in Hong Kong and Toronto, the case mortality rate was 17.0%, with older patients and those with chronic illnesses having a worse outcome [1,2,5].IntroductionThe causative agent has now been determined to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that is genetically distinct from any previously identified coronavirus known to cause disease in animals or humans [1,6–8]. In a primate model system, experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV alone was sufficient to cause a disease complex similar to that observed in humans [9,10]. Genetically, the coronavirus species closest to SARS-CoV are those isolated from small animals traded for culinary purposes, such as the Himalayan palm civet and raccoon-dog, which show 99.8% sequence homology but differ by the insertion of a 29-nucleotide fragment [11]. It is postulated that both coronaviruses have probably arisen from a common natural reservoir, with facilitated interspecies transmission and possibly genetic alteration to SARS-CoV during the close handling and trading of the animals in the same environment.IntroductionThe pulmonary pathology observed in limited postmortem material has been reported together with the clinical symptomatology of SARS [2,8,12–15]. The detection of the coronavirus in relation to pulmonary changes is a critical factor in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. However, this has been hampered by the lack of readily available monoclonal anti-SARS antibodies, as well as the impracticability of extensive electron microscopic examination. Furthermore, although investigation of the time course of SARS-CoV infection with respect to the detection of SARS-CoV RNA has been done by PCR methods, there have been no systematic, large-scale investigations of the temporal or cellular detection of SARS-CoV in lung tissues. Additionally, the extent of organ distribution has not been examined in great detail. Indeed, a recent single-case publication on the immunohistochemical detection of SARS highlighted “…the need for more cases of SARS to be studied to determine the temporal relationship between the duration of illness and viral clearance in human lung tissue…” [15].IntroductionThis study therefore had three purposes. The first was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in lung autopsy specimens from patients who died at different time points of the disease. The second purpose was to determine the cellular distribution of SARS within the lung, and the third was to examine extrapulmonary tissues of patients who died of SARS to determine the extent of systemic distribution.Patient Profiles and Material ::: MethodsA total of 32 patients who died with SARS-CoV infection confirmed by PCR, serological, or viral culture tests were included in the study. The patients came from two geographical regions affected by SARS (Hong Kong [HK] and Toronto, Canada [TO]). For HK cases 1 and 10–13, whole lung specimens were perfused at autopsy with 4% neutral buffered formalin at 20–30 cm H2O pressure until the lungs were fully expanded, before immersion in formalin fixative. Multiple blocks were extensively sampled from all lobes of the lungs for HK cases 1, 6, 7, and 9–13; limited representative blocks were sampled from HK cases 2–5 and 8. For all Toronto cases, approximately half of each lung lobe was removed at autopsy, and a portion was snap-frozen for molecular studies. Multiple blocks of tissue were processed from each lobe for light microscopic examination. Stains for microorganisms and for collagen, and immunohistochemical stains for microorganisms, were performed as necessary. The clinical profiles were retrieved from the patients' records. HK case 1 was a patient who died in the quarantine period for SARS exposure during hospitalization for congestive heart failure. PCR of a throat swab was positive on the fifth day after symptom onset, and she developed fever and respiratory symptoms thereafter. HK case 13 was a patient who died unexpectedly during convalescence from SARS. All other patients died of SARS with progressive deterioration in lung function. All HK patients except cases 1 and 13 had received ventilatory support during life. The pulmonary histopathological features of six of the HK cases (2–6 and 8) have been previously reported [12]. In addition to the autopsy tissue from all HK cases, HK case 5 also had an open lung biopsy, which was also included in this study. Descriptions of the procurement and clinical courses of the TO cases have been described in previous reports [14,16].Development of a Monoclonal Antibody against SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein ::: MethodsBALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of heat-killed SARS-CoV HKU39849-infected FRhK4 cell lysate (107 TCID50/ml). Injections of similar doses were repeated biweekly for 2 mo. Four days after the last booster, 108 spleen cells from an immunized mouse were fused with 107 of NSI myeloma cells with polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 4,000; BDH, Poole, United Kingdom) as the fusing agent. Hybridomas were screened for production of antibodies against SARS-CoV HKU39849-infected cells and recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein by ELISA. Those that produced SARS-CoV nucleoprotein-specific antibodies were cloned twice by limiting dilution. Purified hybridomas were then injected intraperitoneally into mineral oil-primed mice for the production of ascitic fluid. Monoclonal antibodies (4D11 and 3E4) were purified from the ascitic fluid by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate and subcloned to ensure monoclonality.Development of Transfection Controls ::: MethodsThe open reading frames of spike (S), envelope (E), and N genes of SARS-CoV were cloned into the AgeI site of a protein expression vector, pcDNA3A [17]. To express the above viral proteins in eukaryotic cells, these protein expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells individually or in appropriate combinations. Briefly, 1 μg of each of the plasmids was transfected into 293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) as instructed by the manufacturer. At the indicated posttransfection time points, transfected cells were harvested and washed with PBS, then centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 10 min. Pelleted cells were fixed in PBS with 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde, and stored at 4 °C. SARS-CoV S and E gene-transfected cells were used as negative controls, and SARS-CoV N gene-transfected cells were used as positive controls for IHC to confirm the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV nucleoprotein.Immunohistochemistry ::: MethodsThe primary antibodies used included those against cytokeratin (1:50, clone AE1/AE3 [Dako, Glostrup, Denmark]), CD68 (1:50; clone KP1, Dako), EMA (clone E29, Dako), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1; clone 8G7G3/1, Zymed/Invitrogen), chromogranin (clone LK2H10 [Ventana, Tucson, Arizona, United States]), DC-SIGN (a gift from Professor J-L Virilizier, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France), LCA (clone T29/33, Dako), and SARS-CoV N (as described above) (1:400, clone 4D11). Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min and incubating with 1:200 4D11 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Secondary labeling was performed with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse (Dako #E-0354) at 1:100 for 30 min at room temperature and was followed by incubation with streptavidin-ABC complex (Dako #K-0377) at 1:100 for 30 min at room temperature and color development by the 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States; #SK-4200) at room temperature (15–30 min). For double labeling of lung tissue sections, the 4D11 antibody was labeled with FITC, and a TRITC anti-mouse secondary antibody was used. Sections were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with the non-SARS monoclonal overnight, then incubated with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. The FITC-conjugated 4D11 antibody was incubated at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by counterstaining of the nuclei with DAPI for 4 min and mounting with DAKO fluorescence mount (Dako #S-3023). Examination was performed with a Nikon Eclipse E-800 fluorescent microscope with a dual FITC/rhodamine filter.In Situ Hybridization ::: MethodsWe produced digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes specific for the N, E, and S genes of SARS-CoV, and these were pooled and hybridized with 30 μg/ml proteinase K-treated lung sections for 30 min at room temperature. The hybridization buffer (250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 125 μg/ml rat total RNA, 200 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.01% sodium pyrophosphate, 0.3 M sodium chloride, and 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) was mixed with the probes and hybridized overnight at 50°C. The hybridized probes were detected with mouse anti-digoxigenin at 1:100 in 10% normal rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature, then biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse (Dako, E-0354) at 1/100 for 30 min. at room temperature, followed by detection with AEC substrate kit (Vector, SK-4200) at room temperature (up to 30 min). Prior to the tests, the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV probes were verified semiquantitatively by hybridization to separate cell block preparations of a SARS-CoV infected FRHK4 cell line harvested at 8 and 24 h.RT-PCR ::: MethodsSARS-CoV RT-PCR was completed on fresh (HK cases 1 and 10–13), fixed (HK cases 2–9), and snap-frozen (all TO cases) lung tissues from all patients. For the HK cases, total RNA was extracted by standard methods and reverse transcribed to cDNA with reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed with initial denaturation at 94 °C for 8 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min using primers as previously described [1,5,12]. For the TO cases, RT-PCR was completed using RealArt HPA-Coronavirus LC-RT assay (Artus, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described [16,18].Lung Pathology ::: ResultsHK patient 1, who died 5 d after symptom onset during quarantine for SARS contact, showed moderate interstitial and alveolar edema with occasional epithelial desquamation and regeneration. A moderate number of macrophages with abundant foamy cytoplasm had accumulated in the alveolar spaces, but giant cells were not observed. In addition, features of aspiration pneumonia were present, involving small bronchi and adjacent parenchyma in all lobes of the lung. HK patients 2–12 showed established changes indicating diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at different phases of disease progression that affected the lungs to varying extents. Lung pathology of the TO cases has been described previously [14].Lung Pathology ::: ResultsAlthough most of the advanced histological changes revealing DAD can be attributed to ventilation, it should be pointed out that there were also changes of DAD present in five of the TO cases in which no intubation was carried out; thus, viral damage is therefore the most likely mechanism of these changes.SARS-CoV IHC, ISH, and RT-PCR Results ::: ResultsThe transfected cells showed strong cytoplasmic staining for transfectants containing the N gene with no staining on the M or S gene transfectants (Figure 1), confirming the specificity of the monoclonal antibody for the N protein. The control sections of FRhK4 cells showed cytoplasmic staining that was focal at 8 h and diffuse at 24 h.SARS-CoV IHC, ISH, and RT-PCR Results ::: ResultsFour cases showed positive staining for N protein by IHC (HK case 1 and TO cases 1, 4, and 5) (Figure 2). All four of these cases died within 14 d of symptom onset. No staining of the bronchial epithelium was present (Figure 2A), and there was only focal staining of the bronchiolar epithelium (Figure 2B), which showed no evidence of necrosis or regeneration. This observation was confirmed by electron microscopy with viral particles identified in ciliated cells. There was cytoplasmic staining of flattened type 1 pneumocytes as well as alveolar macrophages (Figure 2C and 2D). Adjacent hilar lymph nodes were available for examination in one case (HK case 1), and, of six nodes sampled from this patient, only one isolated mononuclear cell was noted that stained positive for N protein but was negative for the N gene by ISH. Although the staining of the pneumocytes was diffusely cytoplasmic, the staining of the alveolar macrophages was coarsely granular (Figure 2F). For all patients who died beyond 14 d after symptom onset, only scattered single positive cells were seen in lung sections (Figure 2G and 2H), and these were in flattened pneumocytes as well as in mononuclear cells. In one of the Toronto cases (TO case 1) a thrombus was identified (Figure 2E), and positive elongated cells as well as rounded mononuclear cells were identified in this thrombus. This thrombus was present in only one section, and further labeling to confirm the etiology of the infected cells could not be performed. None of the multinucleated epithelial cells seen in any of the patients were positive by ISH or IHC.SARS-CoV IHC, ISH, and RT-PCR Results ::: ResultsIn the four cases that stained positive for N protein by IHC, double labeling with the directly conjugated FITC SARS monoclonal antibody and antibodies for macrophages and epithelial cells showed that the infected cells were positive for EMA (anti-epithelial) and CD68 (anti-macrophage) (Figure 3A and 3B). The number of infected cells was greatest in TO case 1 and HK case 1, both of whom died 5 d after symptom onset. Of interest, TO case 1 showed positive staining of epithelial cells but no staining of macrophages (Figure 3C and 3D). Macrophages showed positive coarse granular staining in HK case 1 and TO cases 4 and 5, who died 11 and 14 d after symptom onset, respectively (Figure 3E). No staining was seen in chromogranin-positive or DC-SIGN-positive cells, and no colocalization with TTF1 (a marker for type 2 pneumocytes) was seen. No staining of lymphocytes was identified. TO case 5, who died on the day 14 after symptom onset, had only scattered single positive cells, and these were in flattened epithelial cells and mononuclear cells.SARS-CoV IHC, ISH, and RT-PCR Results ::: ResultsThe same four cases that showed positive staining for N protein by IHC (HK case 1 and TO cases 1, 4, and 5) were also positive by ISH for the pooled S, E, and N SARS-CoV genes. Multiple lung samples from HK case 1 showed strong cytoplasmic signals in alveolar cells, including desquamating pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Weak signals were detected in occasional macrophages scattered along the bronchial epithelium. No signals were detected in endothelial or stromal cells. In addition to the four cases that stained positive for SARS-CoV by IHN and ISH, a few SARS-CoV infected cells were also detected by ISH and IHC in an open lung biopsy taken 10 d after symptom onset from HK case 5; however, both ISH and IHC were negative on the autopsy lung sample taken from this patient after death (20 d after symptom onset).SARS-CoV IHC, ISH, and RT-PCR Results ::: ResultsResults of RT-PCR are listed in Table 1. Autopsy lung samples from all but three HK cases were positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. When IHC and ISH staining was compared with RT-PCR viral load and disease duration, positive cells by IHC and ISH were identified mainly in cases who had died less than 14 d from onset of illness and in whom lung tissues were associated with viral loads greater than 105 copies per gram of tissue. In two of the cases that were positive for IHC in the lung, other organs were examined for IHC. In HK case 1, when there was strong positive IHC and ISH staining of the lung identified, no IHC- or ISH-positive cells were identified in other organs examined (adrenal gland, kidney, spleen, liver, and heart). In TO case 4, which also showed positive lung staining, no other organs were positive by IHC or ISH (liver, spleen, and kidney). Examination of three other TO cases that stained negative in the lung also showed no positive extrapulmonary staining.DiscussionSARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and RNA were detected in lung autopsy samples from four of the seven patients who died within 2 wk after illness onset, all of whom had high (greater than 105 copies per gram) RT-PCR viral loads in the autopsy lung tissue. SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and RNA were also detected in an open lung biopsy from a patient on day 5 after symptom onset (before death), but not in the same patient's autopsy lung specimen collected on day 20 after symptom onset. Among those lung samples staining positive by ISH or IHC, the signals localized mainly to the alveolar epithelial cells, with lower intensity in alveolar macrophages, indicating that the former are the chief target cells of the virus. Only scattered positive cells were identified in the bronchiolar epithelium, and no significant staining of the bronchial epithelium was observed. No distinctive spread to regional lymph nodes was seen, and we were not able to determine colocalization with DC-SIGN–positive cells. Using an oligonucleotide probe with signal amplification, Nakajima et al. demonstrated SARS-CoV genomes in the alveolar epithelium and macrophages of a 46-year-old woman with SARS, but details of the clinical course of the disease were not stated [19]. The preferential localization of the virus to alveolar cell components relative to the bronchial epithelium seen at the time of death suggests that the alveolar environment might be more permissive to viral replication, and could also account for the high incidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. It should be noted, however, that there are no studies of SARS in humans in which bronchial or tracheal biopsy material from nonfatal cases has been examined. Therefore, whether there is SARS-CoV replication in these parts of the respiratory tract, as is the case in nonhuman primates [10], remains unanswered.DiscussionAmong the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after symptom onset, no ISH or IHC signals were detected in postmortem lung tissues, even in lesions that were morphologically earlier, such as alveolar edema and hyaline membrane or in lungs showing heterogeneous morphological progression, where relatively uninvolved areas were interspersed among more advanced lesions.DiscussionThese findings suggest that there is a decrease of SARS-CoV replication and, consequently, a decrease in intracellular viral copy numbers in lung tissue after the first two weeks of disease, with the terminal event not dependent on continued widespread viral replication. It has also been noted that viral loads detected by RT-PCR or viral culture from nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and stool samples start to decrease 10–15 d after symptom onset, correlating with the time taken for the development of specific anti-SARS antibodies, which starts approximately 10 d from disease onset [5,20].DiscussionThe identification of the cells infected by SARS-CoV in humans has yielded contradictory findings. To et al., using ISH combined with IHC, found dual labeling of only epithelial cells using AE1/AE3 and negative staining for macrophages (antibody CD68) [21]. In contrast, Chen and Hsiao, using ISH, demonstrated a positive signal in carbon-containing macrophages and also within vascular lumina [22]. A later report, also from Taiwan and using ISH, demonstrated positive signal in pneumocytes and not in macrophages, but it is not clear if the same patient material (from a 36-year-old woman) was used in these last two publications [23]. The discrepancies between these findings may be partially explained by three factors: the choice of probes, the age of the patient, and the disease progression. To et al. [21] used the membrane (M) gene, whilst Chow et al. [23] used a mixture of probes (N, M, and replicase [REP]) and found the greatest intensity with the N and M gene and minimal staining with the REP. Our findings support those of both To et al. and Chow et al., in that there was mainly epithelial staining but also definite macrophage (CD68) dual staining, suggesting that, although epithelial cells are the main target of SARS-CoV, the presence of viral RNA in macrophages represents either phagocytosis or low-level replication in these cells. None of these previous ISH-based studies have demonstrated ISH-positive lymphocytes, as reported by Gu et al. [24].DiscussionOur data also suggest that pneumocytes may be infected first, followed by macrophages; TO case 1, who died 5 d after symptom onset, had staining of pneumocytes but no other cells, whereas all other cases, who died five or more days after symptom onset had both pneumocyte and macrophage staining. It is possible that the material used for the To et al. study came from early cases. Shieh et al. describe finding type 2 pneumocytes positive for SARS-CoV in one patient [15]. However, in this study, staining appeared to be restricted to morphological type 1 pneumocytes, in keeping with the findings of Haagmans et al. [25]. However, Haagmans et al. were unable to demonstrate macrophage uptake of SARS-CoV [25]. We also found occasional bronchiolar epithelial cells that were positive for SARS-CoV by ISH, IHC, and electron microscopy, which has not been noted in other studies. To this extent, the immunohistochemical findings are similar to those seen with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, in which there is staining of bronchial epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and macrophages [26]. The age of the patient is also important, as SARS has been associated with greater mortality in the elderly than in the younger age group, and laboratory studies have shown that “aged” mice infected with SARS-CoV had more severe disease and greater cytokine production than younger mice [27]. Thus, differences in age may also be responsible for some of the differences noted between published results.DiscussionThe spectrum of pulmonary lesions in the cases described in this study is characteristic of the acute and resolving stages of acute lung injuries, including DAD due to intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary causes such as bacterial and viral infection, trauma, shock, etc. Unlike the findings of Gu et al., who demonstrated ISH-positive cells in giant cells [24], we repeatedly found no evidence of positive staining by ISH or IHC in the giant cells in our material. As giant cells were seen mainly in patients after 14 d of disease duration, whether they have the same mechanism of formation as seen in animal models needs further investigation. Interestingly, multinucleated epithelial cells have been noted in lung infections due to other viruses such as measles, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial viruses. In fact, none of the changes observed in the present cases is unique for SARS-CoV infection. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DAD and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis have been investigated in clinical and experimental models [28,29]. It has been shown that proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokine pathways are activated within the first 24–48 h following pulmonary insult [30,31]. High initial levels of these activities are associated with persistent pulmonary damage and increased risks of subsequent pulmonary fibrosis and poor outcome in DAD [32–34].DiscussionPrevious studies have published viral loads per gram of tissue using quantitative PCR. This quantitative PCR method has been shown to be of value in determining viral load of viruses in peripheral blood, such as Epstein-Barr virus; but unlike blood, lung tissue is not homogeneous and, in an assessment of viral copies per gram of tissue, whether the tissue sample contains bronchus, scar tissue, edema fluid, or exudates is crucial. In addition, blood in tissues may lead to false-positive PCR results due to viremia rather than viral replication in the tissue. In this study, persons with high SARS-CoV viral loads in their lung tissue had good correlation with the IHC and ISH results [18], but lower lung and organ tissue viral loads showed negative results. These lower viral loads may reflect a small amount of residual genome from a previous infection comparable to RSV infections reported in both stable as well as acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [35]. This is a possible explanation for the low level of RT-PCR positivity in the lung tissues and in other tissues in SARS patients in which we could not detect SARS-CoV by IHC or ISH. Furthermore, in the fatal cases of SARS most patients had seroconverted at the time of death (unpublished data). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level replication in these tissues that was not detectable by IHC and ISH, due to possible limitations of the sensitivity of these assays.DiscussionThis study has shown that alveolar epithelium and macrophages are the chief targets of SARS-CoV infection in the human lung, in agreement with the findings reported in a primate model of the disease [10]. The predominant infiltrating cell in the lungs were macrophages, and this agrees with finding of high levels of macrophage-trophic chemokines in vivo, and in response to SARS-CoV infection in vitro [36]. However, the relative contributions of direct viral damage versus immunopathology in the pathogenesis of SARS remains unclear. Detectable levels of intracellular viral RNA and proteins in lung tissue are present in only the earliest phase of the disease, and they disappear by 2 wk after the onset of symptoms. Although we found only four positive cases by ISH and IHC, and all these were in patients who died within the first 2-wk period, it is likely that many of the negative postmortem cases would have been positive had a lung biopsy been performed earlier. Lack of IHC and ISH staining of extrapulmonary tissues in fatal cases of early SARS suggest that viral involvement of major organs may not be as widespread as data based on RT-PCR results have previously suggested. Our findings have important implications on the clinical and therapeutic management of SARS should it return in the future, in that if antiviral therapy is to be instituted, there may be a broader window of opportunity for intervention with antiviral therapy than there is, for example, with influenza, in which treatment within 48 h is required for discernible clinical impact."
Gene-Specific Countermeasures against Ebola Virus Based on Antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers,"The development of effective countermeasures to the filoviruses Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) has been a long-sought and difficult endeavor, yielding little success [1,2]. Although the worst outbreaks have resulted in only several hundred deaths worldwide [3–6], the filoviruses are considered a significant global health threat, because as the reservoir remains unknown, the pathogen is extremely deadly and highly infectious by aerosol, and there is anecdotal evidence that the use of both MARV and EBOV were explored as potential biowarfare agents in the offensive program of the former Soviet Union [7–10]. The filoviruses are relatively simple viruses of 19-Kb genomes and consist of seven genes which encode nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein, four smaller viral proteins (VPs) (VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), all in a single strand of negative-sensed RNA [11].IntroductionThe development of an effective treatment for EBOV is hindered by lack of a clear understanding of filovirus pathogenesis, disparity between animal models, and both the difficulty and danger of working with EBOV under biosafety–level-4 conditions [1,2]. Although there has been significant progress toward vaccine development via demonstration of protection in nonhuman primates from EBOV illness and death [12,13], a vaccine will not fulfill all requirements for EBOV countermeasures. Administration of type I interferons, therapeutic vaccines, immune globulins, ribavirin, and other nucleoside analogues have been somewhat successful in rodent EBOV models, but all failed to benefit EBOV-infected nonhuman primates [1,14,15]. EBOV frequently causes severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, and administration of a recombinant clotting inhibitor was recently shown to protect 33% of rhesus monkeys [16]. It appears that host-directed consequence management of the disease alone may not be sufficient, and an additional well-orchestrated sequence-specific attack on viral replication may be more effective as a successful anti-filovirus treatment regimen.IntroductionThe ability of virus-specific antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit viral growth by interfering with translation of viral RNAs was first demonstrated in 1978 [17,18]. Since then, remarkable progress has been made by modifying oligonucleotides to increase their stability, affinity, and delivery into cells [19]. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are a subclass of antisense agents modified to include a phosphorodiamidate linkage and morpholine ring, and exhibit limited off-target effects, favorable base stacking, high duplex stability, high solubility, cell permeability, and no hybridization complexities [20,21]. Formation of a PMO:mRNA duplex can effectively block translation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication [22,23]. Antisense PMO are effective as antivirals against vesiviruses [24], flaviviruses [23,25], and the SARS coronavirus [26]. The successful inhibition of viral replication by PMOs in these reports was demonstrated in vitro, but has not yet been shown in an animal model.In Vitro Inhibition of EBOV Translation and Replication by Gene-Specific PMOs ::: ResultsWe hypothesized that PMO inhibition of viral mRNA translation would provide protection against EBOV infections. In order to test our hypothesis, PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of the mRNAs for EBOV VP35, VP24, and L (Figure 1A). These EBOV-specific PMOs demonstrated sequence-specific inhibition when compared with a PMO molecule with a MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences in a reporter-based in vitro translation assay (Figure 1B–1D). No inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 μM concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets (Figure 1B–1D). To determine whether the EBOV-specific PMOs could reduce viral propagation in vitro, VeroE6 cells were pretreated with the PMOs at a concentration of 20 μM and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Treatment with the EBOV VP24-, VP35-, or L-specific PMO was able to consistently reduce the viral titers in the EBOV-infected VeroE6 cells (Figure 1E). A combination of the three PMOs also reduced the viral titers in the VeroE6 cells, but did not show an enhanced effect as compared with treatment with any one of the PMOs (Figure 1E). In the same assay, the viral titers in the scrambled PMO-treated cells were nearly identical to those observed in untreated VeroE6 cells, and the PMOs did not cause obvious cytotoxicity at concentrations used in this assay (unpublished data).EBOV-Specific PMOs Protect Rodents against Lethal EBOV Infection ::: ResultsTo evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the EBOV-specific PMOs, we first determined the survival of mice treated with individual PMOs at 24 h and 4 h before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted EBOV. The three PMOs exhibited a wide range of efficacy against lethal EBOV infection. Both the VP24- and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection when the mice were pretreated twice with 500 μg doses (Figure 2A–2B, p < 0.001 for both VP24 and VP35 PMO treatment versus PBS treatment). In contrast, and despite its strong activity in the cell-free translation assay, the L-specific PMO conferred survival to ~30% of treated mice at the 500-μg dose (Figure 2C, p = 0.5 for both doses of the L PMO compared with PBS-treated mice). As expected, treatment of the mice with a Marburg-specific VP24, VP35, or L PMO did not provide protection against EBOV (Figure 2A–2C). Next, we investigated whether a combination of all these PMOs could further enhance efficacy. We found that when the VP24-, VP35-, and L-specific PMOs were administered together at 24 h and 4 h before lethal EBOV challenge, this resulted in robust protection at all the doses tested (Figure 2D, p = 0.00001, 0.001, and 0.0136, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-μg EBOV-specific PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). To investigate the usefulness of the PMO in a post-exposure regimen, mice were treated with a single dose of the three PMOs administered 24 h after EBOV infection (Figure 2E). The PMO-treated EBOV-infected mice were fully protected at the 500-μg doses, and at lower doses the post-challenge treatment provided enhanced protection (p = 0.00001, 0.0136, and 0.2105, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-μg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Mice receiving a single PMO treatment 4 h before infection showed similar protection (p = 0.00001, 0.237, and 1.0, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-μg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Here, a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and, at the highest concentration, the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. In this single-dose therapeutic regimen, the lower PMO dosages did not provide complete protection. It may be possible that repeated injections of lower concentrations of EBOV-specific PMOs could provide equivalent protection to fewer administrations of higher amounts. Importantly, multiple injections (n > 5) of nonspecific PMOs did not enhance survival of EBOV-infected rodents (unpublished data).EBOV-Specific PMOs Protect Rodents against Lethal EBOV Infection ::: ResultsExamination of tissues 3 d after infection showed that treatment of mice with the combination of EBOV-specific PMOs slowed viral spread compared to mice treated with the scrambled PMO. Infected cells were easily observed in the spleens of the mice treated with the scrambled PMO (Figure 3A), whereas few EBOV-infected cells could be found in the spleens of the anti-EBOV PMO-treated mice (Figure 3B). By 6 d after viral inoculation, EBOV infection was fulminant in the spleens of both EBOV and scrambled PMO-treated animals (unpublished data) and had spread to the livers of both mice treated with scrambled and combination PMOs (Figure 3C–3D). However, the extent of the infection was limited in the EBOV-specific combination PMO-treated mice, and, unlike the scrambled PMO-treated mice, EBOV antigen was not detectable within hepatocytes (Figure 3C–3D). Viral antigen was not observed in the kidney on day 3; however, on day 6, viral antigen was more readily observed in the kidneys of the scrambled PMO-treated compared with the combination PMO-treated mice (unpublished data). Further, the viral titers in the spleen, liver, and kidney of the PMO-treated, infected animals corroborated the observed pattern of antigen staining within the tissues (Figure 3E).EBOV-Specific PMOs Protect Rodents against Lethal EBOV Infection ::: ResultsTo determine whether mice treated with the PMOs generated immune responses to EBOV, they were tested for EBOV-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. 4 wk after infection, the mice demonstrated both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to multiple EBOV-specific peptides, including NP and VP35 sequences (Figure 4A, unpublished data). They also generated strong serum EBOV-specific antibody responses that were similar to the post-challenge antibody responses of mice protected by a therapeutic vaccine containing Ebola virus-like particles (Figure 4B) [15]. To find out if the generated immune responses were protective, PMO-treated mice were rechallenged with another dose of 1,000 pfu of EBOV 4 wk after surviving the initial challenge, and all the mice were completely protected from the second lethal EBOV infection (Figure 4C, p < 0.000001).EBOV-Specific PMOs Protect Rodents against Lethal EBOV Infection ::: ResultsTo verify the effectiveness of the PMO treatment in another EBOV animal model, we infected guinea pigs with EBOV and treated them with a single dose of the PMO combination either 24 h before or 24 h or 96 h after EBOV infection (Figure 5A). Survival was greatly increased in guinea pigs receiving the treatment 96 h after EBOV infection (p = 0.029, compared with untreated guinea pigs), in contrast to guinea pigs treated 24 h before or after infection (p = 0.5 and 0.227, respectively, compared with untreated guinea pigs). The mean viral titer for each group, measured on 7 dpi, closely mirrored the survival rates observed (Figure 5B). Results of a logistic regression indicated that reduction of the viral titer had a significant effect on the survival outcome of PMO-treated guinea pigs (p = 0.0292). With each log10 reduction in viral titer, there was a 56% decrease in the odds of surviving challenge (odds ratio = 0.434). It remains to be determined if administration of multiple or larger PMO doses might have increased the efficacy of the PMO treatments in the guinea pigs.PMO Pretreatment Protects Rhesus Monkeys ::: ResultsBased on the encouraging results both in vitro and in rodents, we designed a small proof-of-concept trial in nonhuman primates. Rhesus monkeys were treated with the VP35 PMO only (n = 4) or a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs (n = 4) from 2 d prior to EBOV infection through day 9 of the infection (Figure 6A). An initial study tested the efficacy of the VP35 PMO, the compound that exhibited the highest activity in mice. Unfortunately, all of the VP35 PMO-treated monkeys, as well as the untreated control monkey, died within the time-to-death expected for EBOV-infected rhesus macaques (days 7, 7, 8, 8, and 7, respectively). In contrast, treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy. Two PMO-treated monkeys survived the EBOV challenge with few clinical signs beyond mild depression from days 6–9 (Figure 6B). A third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9–14 (Figure 6C), but died of a severe bacterial infection, with no evidence of ongoing EBOV infection, on day 16 (Figure 6B, unpublished data). The fourth PMO-treated monkey succumbed to EBOV infection on day 10 (Figure 6B). Three naïve control monkeys used in this experiment received no treatment and succumbed to EBOV infection on days 7, 9, and 10. Since the VP35 PMO alone did not provide any protection to nonhuman primates, these data suggest that a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment and also suggests that protection in the combination PMO-treated monkeys is not due to nonspecific effects of PMO administration.PMO Pretreatment Protects Rhesus Monkeys ::: ResultsWe were able to identify only a few early clinical signs or laboratory values that correlated with survival. The laboratory tests that most closely predicted survival were viral titers, platelet counts, and liver-associated enzymes in the blood. The monkeys that did not survive infection had detectable virus by day 5, in stark contrast to the PMO-treated monkeys that survived, which had little to no detectable viremia on days 3–14 (Figure 6C). Both the PMO-treated and naïve monkeys exhibited thrombocytopenia, although the PMO-treated monkeys that survived did not have platelet counts much below 100,000 at any time (Figure 6D). Similarly, all the monkeys experienced increases in their liver-associated enzyme levels, including alkaline phosphatase. However, the levels in the surviving monkeys did not climb as high as those that succumbed to the infection and returned to normal levels within the month after the EBOV infection (Figure 6E, unpublished data).PMO Pretreatment Protects Rhesus Monkeys ::: ResultsNo correlation was found between survival and multiple other hematological values, body temperature, serum cytokines (measured by a Human 25-plex kit from Biosource, Camarillo, California, United States), or fibrin degradation products (unpublished data). Importantly, PMO administration did not induce early (0–2 dpi) detectable serum IFN, TNF, or other cytokines in the nonhuman primates (unpublished data), indicating that the protection was likely not due to nonspecific effects via induction of innate immunity. Since the surviving PMO-treated monkeys had low to undetectable viremias following infection, we assessed the immune responses of the surviving monkeys. By 28 d after EBOV challenge, the surviving rhesus monkeys had high levels of both anti-EBOV antibodies and T cell responses, similar to the PMO-protected mice (unpublished data).DiscussionEBOV infections represent a significant public health threat, with no reliable effective chemotherapeutics. Our current studies indicate the effectiveness of PMOs targeted to specific EBOV mRNAs against in vitro, rodent, and nonhuman primate EBOV infections. The data presented here are in line with our working hypothesis that a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance.DiscussionCell-free experiments demonstrated that the EBOV-specific PMOs were efficient at inhibiting EBOV mRNA translation and that MARV-specific PMOs had no effect on translation of corresponding EBOV genes. While the reporter-based in vitro assays appeared to be good indicators of sequence-specific activity of PMOs, it seems that in the case of EBOV, the in vitro translation assays were not fully predictive of the rodent efficacy data. Using VeroE6 cells we showed that EBOV replication was moderately suppressed in cells treated with EBOV-specific PMOs. However, no visible difference was observed when comparing the ability of a single PMO and the combination of three PMOs to reduce viral growth. The PMOs used in these studies were not conjugated with peptides that facilitate cellular uptake. We have observed lower cellular uptake of naked PMOs compared with peptide-conjugated PMOs by Vero E6 cells (unpublished data), and this may explain the moderate inhibition observed in the in vitro replication assay. Nonetheless, the data summarized in Figure 1 clearly indicate the feasibility of specific gene targeting by unconjugated PMO and the favorable antiviral activity of these compounds.DiscussionHere, we have presented data demonstrating a therapeutic intervention that interferes with viral replication. We hypothesize that the efficacy of this strategy relies on the ability of PMOs, by reducing viral replication, to create a window of opportunity for the immune system to clear the otherwise lethal infection. This approach does not result in sterile protection, as evidenced by the robust anti-EBOV immune responses in the surviving mice and nonhuman primates, and by the mild clinical signs (thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevations, depression, and lethargy) observed in the PMO-treated monkeys. It is likely that successful treatment of patients infected with EBOV will require a multifaceted approach consisting of an antiviral, and therapeutics for symptom and disease management [1,9].DiscussionPost-exposure treatment with PMOs was the most efficacious against EBOV in rodents, and, presumably, this is explained by the pharmacokinetic properties of PMO. Following parenteral injection, PMOs are cleared from the bloodstream within hours, but accumulate and remain within tissues such as spleen and liver for days (unpublished data). By administering PMO after challenge, it is likely that higher concentrations were available in the circulation and tissues during the peak of viral replication. Thus, the PMOs may have been able to reduce amplification of EBOV during this critical timeframe, allowing development of appropriate host immune responses to the otherwise lethal viral infection [27–29]. Since effective treatment seemed to require critical timing of PMO administration, and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to EBOV infection, we decided to both pretreat and administer daily doses of PMOs after viral challenge in the proof-of-concept nonhuman primate studies. While short-term stability in vivo is an unfavorable property for a potential therapeutic, it should be noted that for a deadly acute infection that has only a short period of treatment in the clinic, repeated administration of a life-saving drug is entirely feasible. Along these lines, future studies may show that the pharmacokinetics of PMO can be enhanced by other modifications or alternative routes of administration or regimen to improve efficacy.DiscussionIn order to corroborate the in vitro data and narrow down the number of antiviral lead candidates, the EBOV mouse model was an obvious choice for testing multiple candidate PMOs [30]. While the mouse model has several differences in pathogenesis compared with EBOV infection of nonhuman primates and humans [31–33], it is widely accepted as an appropriate model for rapid testing of potential antivirals before proceeding to NHP trials. While the differences in the pathology may severely hamper the predictive value of mouse studies using therapeutic strategies that rely on targeting mouse-specific virus–host interaction or the pathologic response by rodents, interventions that target viral replication can be evaluated with a high degree of confidence in this model. Antiviral efficacy in rodents may not always be predictive of efficacy in nonhuman primates, although an antiviral compound that is unsuccessful in rodents will most likely also fail in nonhuman primates, justifying initial screening in rodent models.DiscussionWe have initiated a drug-discovery strategy to identify “druggable,” efficacious anti-filovirus PMOs. This proof-of-principle study using PMOs demonstrates favorable anti-EBOV activity both in vitro and in vivo; thus, these molecules represent a pool of potential lead compounds for further evaluation and optimization. Future studies will focus on determining the most favorable PMO dose and regimen and also the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Additionally, antisense PMO designed to target other regions within the EBOV genome will be pursued. Genetically designed microbial therapeutics, such as antisense PMOs or other sequence-based approaches, allow quick hit-to-lead optimization and may accelerate time-to-drug development. Together, these strategies could result in a highly efficacious therapeutic treatment regimen for lethal viral infections. Nucleotide-based antivirals, such as PMOs, can be easily produced in large quantities, have already been tested in human clinical trials, and have appropriate safety profiles for use with humans [34]. The results presented here have far-reaching implications for the treatment of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses, and for diseases caused by many other acute viral diseases including SARS, influenza, and dengue, or other emerging pathogens.PMOs. ::: Materials and MethodsPMOs were designed with sequence homology near or overlapping the AUG translational start site of EBOV VP35 (5′-CCTGCCCTTTGTTCTAGTTG-3′), EBOV VP24 (5′-GCCATGGTTTTTTCTCAGG-3′), and EBOV L (5′-TGGGTATGTTGTGTAGCCAT-3′). Similarly, PMOs were designed with sequence homology near or overlapping the AUG start site of MARV VP35 (5′-GTCCCACATTGTGAAAATTAT-3′), MARV VP24 (5′-CGTTGATAATTCTGCCATG-3′), and MARV L (5′-GATATTGAGTTGGATGCTGCAT-3′). Either the MARV-specific PMOs or an unrelated, “scrambled” PMO (5′-AGTCTCGACTTGCTACCTCA-3′) were used as controls in these experiments. The PMOs were synthesized by AVI BioPharma, (Corvallis, Oregon, United States), as previously described [35].In vitro translation assay. ::: Materials and MethodsThe protein coding sequence for firefly luciferase, without the initiator-Met codon ATG, was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pCiNeo (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Subsequently, complementary oligonucleotides for EBOV VP35 (−98 to +39; bases 3020 to 3157), EBOV VP24 (−84 to +43; bases 10261 to 10390), EBOV L (−80 to +49; bases 11501 to 11632) were duplexed and subcloned into Nhe 1 and Sal 1 sites. The single AUG in each viral sequence leader is in frame with the coding sequence of luciferase. The plasmids were linearized with Not I, and in vitro transcribed RNA was produced using the T7 polymerase-based Megascript kit and protocol (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States). In vitro translations were carried out by programming reactions with transcribed RNA at a final concentration of 1 nM, as previously described [36]. The average light units produced by the set of reactions for each treatment were normalized to the mean of all water-only control reactions and expressed as relative light units as compared to the luciferase signal of control reactions.In vitro assessment of viral replication in the presence of PMOs. ::: Materials and MethodsVero E6 cells were grown to confluency in a 24-well plate. On day 0, the indicated PMOs were added in 100 μl of serum-free EMEM. After 2 h, 900 μl of EMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum was added for a final concentration of 20 μM of the VP24, VP35, L, or a combination of all three PMOs. On day 1, the medium was removed from the cells and one multiplicity of infection of EBOV-Zaire was added to each well in 100 μl of serum-free EMEM. After 1 h, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells washed twice with PBS. The PMOs were reintroduced for 2 hs in serum-free EMEM and then brought up to a total of 1 ml with EMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Supernatant was removed from the cells at 24, 48, or 72 hpi, and the viral titers were determined by standard plaque assay [37].Animals. ::: Materials and MethodsC57BL/6 mice, aged 8–10 wk, of both sexes, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center (Frederick, Maryland, United States). Mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided autoclaved water and chow ad libitum. Mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with ~1,000 pfu of mouse-adapted EBOV diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [30]. Unless otherwise noted, mice were treated 2× at 24 h and 4 h prior to EBOV challenge with 0.5 mg, 0.05, or 0.005 mg of each of the EBOV or MARV VP24, VP35, and L PMOs, a combination of PMOs, or an unrelated PMO. In one presented study, the PMOs (0.5, 0.05, or 0.005 mg) were administered in a single dose 4 h before or 24 h after challenge. Previously, we showed Ebola virus-like particles given 24 h before viral challenge protects mice from lethal EBOV infection. Therefore, for comparison of post-challenge immune responses, a group of mice was injected with virus-like particles 24 h before EBOV challenge [15]. C57BL/6 mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of mouse-adapted EBOV [30].Animals. ::: Materials and MethodsFemale Hartley guinea pigs, 400–500 g in weight, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts, United States) and quarantined at the US Army Research Institute for Infectious Diseases for at least 72 h before manipulations. To determine efficacy of the PMOs in guinea pigs, the animals were treated intraperitoneally with a single 10-mg dose of each of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs 24 h before or 24 h or 96 h after subcutaneous challenge with 1,000 pfu of guinea-pig adapted EBOV [38]. On day 7, the guinea pigs were bled from the retro-orbital sinus and the plasma samples were assessed for viral titers by plaque assay [37].Animals. ::: Materials and MethodsFemale rhesus macaques of 3–4 kg in weight were challenged with ~1,000 pfu of EBOV-Zaire (1995 strain) [14] by intramuscular injection following PMO treatment. The monkeys were treated from days −2 through day 9 via a combination of parenteral routes (for treatment schedule, see Figure 6). The dose of the VP24 PMO was 12.5–25 mg at each injection, and the dose of the VP35 and L PMOs ranged from 12.5–100 mg per injection. All the monkeys in this study were found to be STLV-1, SIV-, and Herpes B-negative in testing prior to initiation of the study. Monkeys 1496 and 1510 both presented with redness in and bleeding from their vaginal area on days 3–5 post infection. The estrus status of the other monkeys in this study was unknown, although they did not present with vaginal bleeding throughout the 35 d that they were monitored during this study.Animals. ::: Materials and MethodsThe number of animals in each group was determined with the help of a statistician in order to use the least number of animals possible yet still to have the statistical power necessary to allow meaningful interpretation of the data produced. All EBOV-infected animals were handled under maximum containment in a biosafety–level-4 laboratory at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. Research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adhered to principles stated in the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996). The facility where this research was conducted is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.Hematologic and pathologic sampling. ::: Materials and MethodsBlood samples were obtained under anesthesia by cardiac puncture for mice and from the femoral vein of monkeys. Viremia was assayed by traditional plaque assay [37]. Hematological, cytokine, and D dimer levels, as well as liver-associated enzymes, were measured as previously described [16]. On day 3 and day 6 after EBOV infection, gross necropsies were performed on three mice from each group pretreated with either the combination of PMOs or the “scrambled” PMO. The tissues were collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin and held in the biosafety–level-4 laboratory for a minimum of 30 d. The tissues were then decontaminated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histology. The sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine light microscopy or exposed to EBOV-specific antisera to identify viral antigen within the tissue samples.Immune responses following EBOV infection. ::: Materials and MethodsBlood was collected from the surviving mice or monkeys, respectively, 28 d after EBOV challenge. Levels of EBOV-specific antibodies were determined from serum or plasma samples, as previously described [39]. Antibody titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving a net optical density value ≥0.2. Epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of surviving mice were determined as previously described [40]. Briefly, EBOV-specific responses were analyzed by culturing splenocytes with 1–5 μg overlapping 15-residue peptides representing the GP or VP40 of EBOV (Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia) or 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1.25 μg/ml ionomycin in complete RPMI containing 10 μg/ml brefeldin A. After 5 h of culture, the cells were stained with anti-CD44, -CD8, or -CD4 (Pharmingen, San Diego, California, United States) in brefeldin A. After the cell surface staining, the cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, and stained with anti-IFN-γ PE (Pharmingen).Statistical analysis. ::: Materials and MethodsTo compare the survival rates in the rodent experiments, we used a Fisher exact test with stepdown bootstrap adjustment. In the guinea pig experiments, the viral titers were analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett's test, and the effect of viral titers on survival were analyzed by logistic regression. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant."
TaqMan probe array for quantitative detection of DNA targets,"Microarry-based analyses have been well established and are currently used in a wide range of biological assays (1–5). Extrapolation of their use for infectious diagnostics and detection of biodefense related agents provides an attractive alternative to conventional analytical approaches. Hence the critical need for advanced diagnostic systems in microbiology is to detect rapidly genetic information within the known and unanticipated pathogenic microrganisms associated with the human health (i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi). With the parallelism offered by DNA microarray technology we are able to pursue and develop an approach to large-scale analyses of such abundance of genetic information in these organisms. The main technical challenge in this field arises from the difficulty in labeling sufficient copies of pathogenic biomarkers. However, when integrated in one portable diagnostic device label-free detection has great potential for addressing this neckbottle and speeds up practical application of microarray technology.INTRODUCTIONReal-time PCR technologies as label-free methods have been used widely for gene expression, allelic discrimination and pathogen detection in solution (6–10). Their principle is fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where fluorescence is detected as a result of a change in physical distance between a reporter fluorophore and a quencher molecule. Molecular beacons firstly introduced by Tyagi and Kramer (9) and TaqMan probes originated from 5′ nuclease cleavage activity (11) and subsequently refined by Lee et al. (12) are the two main probe types in the real-time PCR systems for detecting the accumulation of specific PCR product and discriminating alleles. Their application is usually limited detecting only a few DNA targets, although several efforts have been made to improve the throughput performance of TaqMan probes in a single tube. For example, Lee et al. (13) have used some TaqMan probes labeled with different fluorophores to detect simultaneously seven various DNA targets. Tong et al. (14) have also described a combinatorial design of distinct fluorescence emission signatures for higher throughput assays. Also, several groups have immobilized molecular beacons on a solid surface to construct a molecular beacon array to resolve the target DNA sequences spatially (15–18). These pioneering works provide a new opportunity in quantitative, label-free and high-throughout detection of nucleic acid analysis. However, a high fluorescent background because of incomplete quenching of the molecular beacons and the interfacial effect induced by the electrostatic properties at the solid–liquid interface, greatly decreases the signal-to-background ratio. Previously, our research group had fabricated molecular beacon arrays on an agarose film to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms of unlabeled PCR products. Because of a solution-like hybridization environment and high binding capacity provided by the agarose film, an improved signal-to-background ratio for single nucleotide mismatch were observed (19). But this approach is not suitable for real-time monitoring of the PCR and hybridization process since the agarose film is not capable of withstanding high temperature during PCR. Therefore, we need more robust microarray technology to resolve this problem.INTRODUCTIONHere, we introduce a more robust microarray set-up using TaqMan probes for high-throughput quantification of nucleic acids. The conventional TaqMan probe is a double-labeled fluorogenic probe consisting of an oligonucleotide with a reporter fluorescent dye attached to the 5′ end and a quencher dye attached to the 3′ end (8). Owing to these chemical properties such probes can not be directly used in the immobilizaton on a glass slide because the reporter dyes of these probes are cleaved and released into the solution during the PCR. In this paper, we report firstly a set of innovative amino-modified TaqMan probes immobilized on a glass slide to form a regular array pattern for quantitative nucleic acid detection. The structure of this unique TaqMan probe consists of an amino group at the 3′ end for immobilization, poly(T)20 as a linker arm, 6-FAM-labeled phosphoramidite at the middle as the reporter dye and a dabcyl group at 5′ end as the quencher. In contrast with conventional TaqMan probe where the fluorophore is located at 5′ end of the probe, our 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probe is designed to have a quencher located at the 5′ end of the probe so that the quencher can be cleaved and the fluorescent signal on the array can be restored during the PCR. These features ensure that the TaqMan probes can be used to quantify nucleic acid targets on a solid–liquid surface. We used this approach to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time nucleic acid analysis in parallelism directly from genomic DNA, e.g. from a mip gene of Legionella pneumophila (DNA1), from a hexon gene of human adenovirus (DNA2), from a rfbE gene of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (DNA3), as negative control one from a non-related human ESR1 gene (DNA4), and lastly from a specific nucleic acid fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (DNA5). We also investigated the specificity, sensitivity and cleavage dynamics of TaqMan probes immobilized on a glutaraldehyde-modified glass slide. Like the cleavage in solution, we find the cleavage of the quencher dye occurs on the array and causes an increase in reporter fluorescence intensity because the reporter is no longer quenched. TaqMan probe arrays have a great potential to provide a fresh and attractive scheme that has the ability to high-throughput, real-time quantitative detection of the unlabeled DNA targets.Amino-TaqMan probes ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS3′-Amino-modified TaqMan probes and other oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized and purified with double reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography by the Department of chemistry, University of Florida. Fmoc (fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) protected 3′-amino-modifier C7 CPG (Glen Research: 20-2957) was used as the solid support for synthesis. The probes were synthesized with UltraMild CE phosphoramidites [Pac-dA-CE (10-1601), Ac-dC-CE (10-1015), iPr-Pac-dG-CE (10-1621) and dT-CE (10-1030)]. 5′-Amino-modifier C6 (10-1906) was introduced at 5′ end for Dabcyl-NHS ester coupling. Finally the Fmoc amino protection was removed with 20% poperidine/DMF and the TaqMan probes were cleaved from the CPG with 50 mM K2CO3 in anhydrous MeOH. These TaqMan probes are specially designed for prefect complement with the corresponding specific nucleic acid fragment of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, E.coli O157:H7, a human adenovirus, L.pneumophila and a human ESR1 gene. Their genomic DNAs were extracted from the reference strains of five different microorganisms by a commercial Kit (Qiagen, Inc.).Data acquisition ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe fluorescence images were collected with the standard FITC filter by laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP) employing a 488 nm Ar ion laser. A low-powerful objective lens (10×) was used in all the experiments. The system control program is Leica TCS NT software version 1.6.587. The laser moves from point to point to produce the scanned images at medium speed and in unidirectional scan mode. The slide is imaged with a zoom factor of 1 and the image size of the scanning field area is 1 mm × 1 mm. Adjust the gain and offset of PMT1 until the image is bright enough and shows a good contrast. All relevant parameters of the Leica TCS system were not adjusted again in all the scanning process. Images were analyzed by ImageJ version 1.3 (NIH) ().Manufacture of TaqMan probe arrays ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe amino-silane derived glass slides (DAKO, Catalog no. S3003) were cleaned with deionized distilled water and incubated in 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH = 7.4) for 2 h. Then the slides were thoroughly washed twice with methanol, acetone and deionized distilled water, and dried. Spotting solutions were obtained by dissolving TaqMan probes in sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 9.0) at the concentration of 10 µM. Pin-based spotting robot PixSys5500 (Cartesian Tech. Inc.) with SMP3 pin was used to perform TaqMan probe array spotting. About 500 pl spotting solution was spotted on the glutaraldehyde derived glass slide with 120 µm diameter and 200 µm spacer. After spotting, glutaraldehyde derived glass slides were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and at 37°C for 2 h. Next, the slides were soaked twice in 0.1% SDS for 2 min at room temperature with vigorous agitation and then transferred the slides into a sodium borohydride solution (Dissolve 1.5 g NaBH4 in 450 ml PBS, and then add 133 ml 100% ethanol) for 5 min at room temperature to reduce free aldehydes. Finally, the slides were washed thoroughly in 0.1% Tween, rinsed in distilled water and dried by a flow of nitrogen gas. The TaqMan probe array can be used for immediately 5′ nuclease PCR assays on a solid surface or stored at 4°C for future use.TaqMan assay in solution ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSThe PCRs were performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, which is an optimized real-time PCR buffer supplied by Applied Biosystems for TaqMan reactions, 200 nM of each primer for different fragments, 200 nM amino-modified TaqMan probes and 10 ng different genomic DNAs in a PCR tube. The amplification condition consists of an initial 2 min at 50°C for optimizing the UNG enzyme, and 10 min denaturation at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s of denaturing at 95°C, 30 s of annealing at 52°C, and 60 s of extension at 65°C. The instrument is the Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research Ltd, Australia).Real-time amplification on TaqMan probe array ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAs for the heterogeneous 5′ nuclease PCR assay, glass slides on which 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes were covalently bonded, were subjected to a 1 h blocking step using 5× SSC buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, washed in 5× SSC buffer and finally washed in water. DNA amplification was initiated on the glass slides with the same PCR mixture as above except without the amino-modified TaqMan probes in a chamber sealed by Gene-frame (Catalog no. AB-0576). The microscope glass slides were put into the 16 × 16 twin tower block thermocycler (PTC 225; MJ Research). Thermocycling was carried out as follows: an initial 2 min at 50°C for optimal UNG enzyme, and 10 min denaturation at 95°C and various cycle numbers from 20 to 38 cycles (95°C for 30 s, 52°C for 45 s and 65°C for 2 min).Single mismatch nucleotide detection on TaqMan probe array ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSIn order to investigate the capability of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TaqMan probe array, a 193 base oligomer of the hexon gene fragment (with an A/G wild type/mutation type mismatch at position 37) was designed to be complementary to the 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probe TM2 and this was obtained via gene synthesis method (20) service provided by Shanghai Sangon Co., China and verified by sequencing. During the amplification 1 ng DNA targets of the wild-type hexon gene fragment and the synthesized oligomer with the PCR mixture descried above were respectively injected to the chamber sealed by Gene-frame at each annealing temperature (at 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58°C, respectively), the instrument, reaction condition and the acquisition of fluorescence images are identical to those described above.Design of TaqMan probes ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe conventional TaqMan probe is a double-labeled fluorogenic probe consisting of an oligonucleotide with a reporter fluorescent dye attached to the 5′ end and a quencher dye attached to the 3′ end (8). When the reporter dye is excited by irradiation, its fluorescent emission will be quenched through the process of fluorescence energy transfer. During the annealing/extension step of PCR amplification, the probe will be recognized by DNA polymerase so that the cleavage will occur between the reporter and the quencher dyes by 5′–3′ nuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase. Then the reporter dye is no longer quenched and the increase in reporter fluorescence intensity will be observed. In this process, a surface immobilized TaqMan probes was designed and synthesized with an amino group at the 3′ end, fluorescein-dT at the middle as the reporter dye and Dybcyl at the 5′ end as a quencher. A CPG with Fmoc protected amino group and UltraMild CE phosphoramidites were used for synthesis. The Fmoc group is quite stable and base liable. After detritylation in 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA)/dichloromethane (DCM), the monomethoxytritylamino (MMT) was removed from 5′ end amino group, which was then used to couple with Dabcyl-NHS ester on the CPG while the 3′ end amino group was still protected by Fmoc. After removal of Fmoc amino protection and cleavage, the probes were released from the CPG and 3′ end amino group was used for immobilization. The 20 base T was used as a linker to minimize the space hindrance for enzyme cleavage. When the 5′–3′ nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleave the 5′ dabcyl molecule into solutions during PCR on slides, the FAM reporter dye at 3′ end is still bound to the solid surface by covalent bond. Then the fluorescence increment of the FAM dye on the specific array can be directly acquired by a scanner. Dabcyl is non-fluorescent and can quench FAM dye well. Furthermore, dabcyl is compatible with the amino group and economical in the probes synthetic process. In addition, a 20 base thymine spacer is used to minimize destabilization caused by 3′ end immobilization.Design of TaqMan probes ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOwing to the synthesis of the 3′-amino-modified TaqMan probes with three different chemical modifications on an oligo probe is relative complex and not popular in commercial synthesis, we designed 10 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes and obtained five good probes. The 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes and the corresponding primer pairs are summarized in Table 1. We used the laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP) to acquire the experiment data and to produce the scanned images at stable speed. Under the certain objective (10×) and eye lens (10×), the image size of the scanning field area is 1 mm × 1 mm. The area of the probe array of 3 × 5 almost covers the size of the scanning field area. Of course, we can assemble a series of different frames of the collected images together if you want to expand the scanning area for immobilizing more probes. The physical distance between the reporter and quencher are extremely important in the design of this type of fluorogenic probe. According to the previous studies, the melting temperature (Tm) value and the distance of the two dyes of the conventional TaqMan probe, and amplion length are all critical factors in a successful real-time PCR. For example, a conventional probe system will provide an appropriate ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the reporter dye over the quencher dye, typically both in solution at 60–67°C of Tm and 75–150 bp of amplion length (8,21). If too large physical distance between the two dyes in solution will directly result in low quench efficiency. We choose 20–24 bases between the two dyes in all the amino-modified TaqMan probes (TM1–TM5) and their amplion sizes are no more than 250 bp. Increasing the length of amplicons may result in a longer annealing/polymerization step or a higher Mg2+ concentration, which decreases the specificity of the PCR. It might also make the system less efficient and inflexible.TaqMan probes array ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe scheme of TaqMan probe arrays before and after cleavage is illustrated in Figure 1. The 3′ end amino-modified TaqMan probes TM1 and TM2 immobilized on the glass slide maintain a close physical proximity between the reporter and the quencher (Figure 1a) and emit little fluorescence. When PCR mixtures including a template DNA1 are added, DNA1 and its complementary probe TM1 form a rigid probe–target duplex (Figure 1b). Then Taq DNA polymerase will recognize this hybrid and cleave the quencher of TM1 because of its inherent 5′ nuclease activity. The quencher of TM1 is released into solution and the reporter dye at 3′ end is still bound on surface so that the fluorescence of TM1 is restored, while TM2 is still quenched (Figure 1c). Then reporter fluorescence increments from different sites on surface can be directly acquired by a fluorescence confocal microscope. These fluorescence signals are spatially resolved to determine the DNA target's quantity (Figure 1d).Amino-modified TaqMan assay in solution ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInitially, we examined the quantitative performance of the 3′ end amino-modified TaqMan probes during real-time PCR system in solution. To further evaluate the sensitivity of these probes, we cloned a 191 bp fragment of the hexon gene of human adenovirus and prepared serial dilutions ranging from 1.2 × 107 to 1.2 × 101 copies of the target. The consecutive real-time PCR provide well-shaped curves of the increase in fluorescence intensity of the amino-modified TaqMan probe for the specific hexon gene over this broad dynamic detection range (Figure 2). From left to right, the curves denoted the 1.2 × 107, 1.2 × 106, 1.2 × 105, 1.2 × 104, 1.2 × 103, 1.2 × 102 and 1.2 × 101 copies, respectively. The fluorescence signal increase above the instrument threshold during PCR for the specific fragment occurred at distinct cycles. High fluorescence intensities and well-shaped standard curves with relatively identical distances for the serial dilutions led to clear and interpretable results (shown in Figure 2 inset). The results suggest that 5′ end of the dabcyl quencher and 3′ end of the FAM reporter in our amino-modified TaqMan probes can be used in quantitative analysis of nucleic acid targets in solutions.Specificity of TaqMan probes array ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFigure 3 shows the specificity of detecting unlabeled nucleic acid targets by a 5′ nuclease PCR assay using the amino-modified TaqMan probe glass array. The PCR mixtures contain 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, different concentrations of each primer, a final 1 ng concentration of different genomic DNA templates, a no DNA template control, and DNA1, DNA12, DNA123 and DNA1235, respectively. Then the PCR mixtures were injected to a chamber sealed by the gene-frame on the five different slides, respectively, and amplified in the 16 × 16 twin tower block thermocycler (PTC 225; MJ Research). After the reaction, the slides were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20 (2 × 5 min), once in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20 and rinsed in distilled water. The fluorescence images were collected by a confocal fluorescence microscope (Materials and Methods). We then found that the fluorescence intensities of various amino-modified TaqMan probes are different and that the fluorescence intensity increments of the different DNA template are clearly located at corresponding sites. The results indicate the high specificity of the 5′ nuclease PCR using the amnio-modified TaqMan probes arrayed on surface and demonstrate how our TaqMan probe arrays can successfully detect the presence of specific gene fragments.Fluorescence changes in real-time PCR ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe also investigated the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the amino-modified TaqMan probe arrays. A mixture of PCR described in Materials and Methods containing 1 ng DNA2 template was injected into a chamber sealed by the gene-frame and amplified. The reaction condition is also same as described above except that the PCR cycle numbers are different. To evaluate the dynamic changes of fluorescence intensities, we acquired serial fluorescence images at various cycle numbers i.e. 1, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35 and 38 (shown in Figure 4A). The scatter diagram in Figure 4B plots the fluorescence signal data versus PCR cycle number. This result with a slightly diminished signal-background-ratio is similar to that reported above in solutions. There are two possible interpretation of the signal-background-ratio reduction for the immobilized TaqMan probe arrays. First, the interfacial effect makes their inherent structure different from that in the solution. This structure change influences negatively on quenching efficiency and increases their fluorescence backgrounds on solid–liquid surfaces. Second, the steric effects caused by high immobilization densities decrease the rate of the duplex formation of the immobilized probe and DNA target, which might also decrease the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, the Tm value of the amino-modified TaqMan probe should be set about 10°C higher than that of the primer. This ensure that each TaqMan probe is coupled with a DNA target via base pairing before the forward and inverse primers are attached, and that the free 5′ end of the immobilized TaqMan probe is accessible for nuclease activity by DNA polymerase. This also ensures that the large amount of the probes participates in the cleavage process and it is easier to get the high signal-background-ratio.Sensitivity of TaqMan probe array ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn order to investigate the sensitivity of an immobilized 3′ end amino-modified TaqMan probe array, the same PCR mixture containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and different copies of the hexon gene (prepared as described above) in a PCR tube was used. After the amplification, each image of different concentration DNA targets was collected. In these images, the TaqMan probes were spotted on the slides in triplet format. From top to bottom, the probes are TM5, TM4, TM3, TM1 and TM2, respectively. Figure 5 showed the fluorescence intensity changes of the amino-modified TaqMan probe (TM2) on the surface with a broad range of 1.2 × 107 to 1.2 × 101 target DNA copies of the hexon gene. The results indicate that the amino-modified TaqMan probe array has good sensitivity.Single nucleotide mismatches detection of TaqMan probe array ::: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFinally, we also evaluated the ability of detecting a single nucleotide mismatch in DNA targets on a TaqMan probe array. The two different DNA targets, the 193 base synthesized oligomer (with an A/G wild type/mutation type mismatch at position 37) and the wild type of the hexon gene fragment, were applied to the amplification on a TaqMan probe array. During the amplification corresponding images at different annealing temperatures were collected at 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58°C, respectively, and these are shown in Figure 6. The fluorescence signals of the two targets on the TaqMan probe array are obviously different. Hence, the results clearly discriminate between a perfectly matched target and single nucleotide mismatched target.CONCLUSIONSIn this paper, we have designed a set of amino-modified dual-labeled fluorescence probes with pretty high quenching efficiency and high specificity for TaqMan assays on glass slides. We have also immobilized successfully 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes to aldhyde-modified glass slides for quantitative PCRs in real-time by the poly(T)20 linker molecule and 3′-amino group. The poly(T)20 linker molecule is chemically robust easily enabling a decrease both in the steric effect and also in the surface effect. The thermal stability and the retention of 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes bound to the functionalized glass surface are very suitable for the PCR thermocycling reaction using the covalent bond linkage. Finally, a TaqMan probe array on an aldhyde derived glass slide was fabricated and we investigated its specificity, its sensitivity and the dynamics change of fluorescence intensity at various PCR cycle numbers.CONCLUSIONSThis study presents a first experimental demonstration of direct real-time quantitative nucleic acid analysis from genomic DNA by 5′ nuclease cleavage assays on a surface array format. In all previous studies of real-time PCR in solution, freely-diffusing TaqMan probes were used, which have limited parallel analysis capability. Our results indicate that TaqMan probe arrays have potentially a great advantage in real-time quantification of multiple unlabeled nucleic acid targets, which promises a great opportunity for clinical applications such as gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. In the future, advances in chemistry for instance in reporter and quencher dyes technology resulting in greater quench efficiency will even further improved the performance of our TaqMan probe arrays."
Lung Infection—A Public Health Priority,"The Disproportionate Burden on the Poor ::: The Global Burden of Lung InfectionsLung infections are especially common and severe among the poor. When the relative burden of disease in communities is assessed by normalizing DALYs to population size, lung infections caused the loss of 2,983 DALYs/100,000 population in the poorest regions compared to 137 DALYs/100,000 population in the wealthiest. Thus, poverty is associated with a more than 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.The Disproportionate Burden on the Poor ::: The Global Burden of Lung InfectionsAccording to WHO, 2.6 billion people live in “Low Income” countries, with Gross National Income (GNI) per capita ≤US$765, and 2.2 billion people live in “Lower Middle Income” countries, with GNI per capita of US$766–US$3,035. This single incremental improvement in income is associated with a dramatic difference in the relative burden of disease caused by lung infections. Lung infections caused the loss of 535 DALYs per 100,000 population in the “Lower Middle Income” population in 2002. Comparing this figure to the relevant figures listed above, it may be surmised that the vast majority (86%) of the difference due to income occurs between the lowest income group and the next-to-lowest income group. Thus, the poor are especially likely to suffer from lung infections, and relatively modest income improvements may substantially lessen their burden of lung infection. As with many infectious diseases [5], fighting poverty and improving health care for the impoverished will greatly decrease the global burden of lung infections.Lung Infections Threaten All Economic GroupsAmong those who live in wealthy societies, infectious diseases cause less of a burden than do chronic diseases such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases. However, even among advantaged populations, lung infections are remarkably prominent. In the wealthiest as well as the poorest regions of the world, lung infections cause a greater burden than any other infectious disease (Figure 2). Thus, while climbing the socioeconomic ladder associates with a lesser burden, lung infections threaten across the economic spectra.Lung Infections Threaten All Economic GroupsFor those in wealthier populations, little further advancement is evident against lung infections. Focusing exclusively on the highest income populations (“Established Market Economies” or “High Income” groups in the WHO Burden of Disease Study), a comparison of the relative DALY losses due to lung infection shows little change from 1990 to 2002 (151 and 137 DALYs lost/100,000 population, respectively), whereas there have been dramatic improvements in the burdens due to other diseases within these wealthy communities. For example, among the wealthiest populations, HIV in 2002 caused less than half the disease it did in 1990 (from 159 to 72 DALYs lost/100,000 population). There are no DALY statistics available prior to 1990, but other indicators such as the US mortality rate due to pneumonia and influenza suggest that, for wealthy countries, there has been little or no progress against lung infections since the first half of the last century [6].Lung Infections Threaten All Economic GroupsFor several reasons, lung infections in wealthy countries seem poised to become even more of a concern in the near future. First, in these populations, advancing age makes lung infections increasingly more prevalent and life-threatening [7]. Therefore, demographic shifts resulting in an expanding elderly community within wealthy countries [8] suggest that more and more people are likely to suffer severely from lung infections. Second, novel respiratory infections emerge frequently, some of which can be highly virulent. Recent examples include SARS [9] and avian influenza [10]. If and when these new infections emerge, globalization increases the likelihood that such respiratory infections will become rapidly widespread [11]. Third, microbes that cause lung infections are increasingly resistant to previously effective antibiotics. While effective medical and public health practice will hopefully prevent the arrival of a “post-antibiotic” era [12], the continuously diminishing number of drugs effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other common agents of community and hospital-acquired pneumonias raise concern.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsAll diseases included in Figures 1 and 2, and many not listed, are critical targets of research and health care. All require more funding and more effort than they now receive. However, if some diseases (such as lung infections) are less widely recognized as critical threats to our health, then resources and efforts will be allocated suboptimally, resulting in poorly tailored responses to public health needs.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsDetermining whether funds are contributing to research against a given disease is horribly inexact. Furthermore, the conceptual advances with most promise against a particular disease may more likely result from basic research than from disease-focused research. However, substantial resources are allocated to understanding and fighting particular diseases, and biomedical progress against those diseases is influenced by these targeted efforts. While the greatest burdens of disease and the greatest threats to the public health might be presumed to receive the greatest shares of research funding, they do not.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spent approximately US$28 billion on health-related research in 2004 [13], of which US$287 million was allocated to lung infections. This is substantive and laudable, but it must be considered in perspective. It pales in comparison with the US$1.63 billion spent on biodefense. More NIH money is spent on smallpox research (US$324 million) alone than on lung infection research. While it is essential to be proactive in recognizing, preventing, and preparing for looming or emerging threats to public health, it may be questioned whether funding for speculated risks should so overwhelm funding for diseases already causing such tremendous burdens.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsLung infection research is also poorly funded when compared with other currently significant public health concerns. For example, US$2.85 billion were spent on HIV/ AIDS research, which is substantively improving prospects against this very important disease. It is remarkable, though, that lung infections cause a comparable or greater disease burden (Figures 1 and 2), yet they receive only one-tenth of HIV/AIDS research funding. In a similar vein, the NIH allocated comparable resources to lung infections as to sexually transmitted diseases (US$237 million), even though in wealthy countries such as the US lung infections cause seven times more disease than do sexually transmitted diseases (Figure 2), with even larger differentials in poorer countries. These figures from the NIH are but a few examples demonstrating that lung infections are relatively under-represented.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsReacting to the pandemic threat of the recently emerging avian influenza virus (H5N1), the president of the US recently requested a lump sum totaling US$7.1 billion [14]. The majority of requested funds in the president's plan, more than US$5.3 billion, would be slated for the manufacture, purchase, and stockpile of vaccines and antivirals targeting influenza. An additional US$0.8 billion would be allocated for research on new vaccines and antivirals against influenza, US$0.6 billion for influenza preparedness planning, and US$0.3 billion to help countries detect and contain influenza outbreaks. It is this author's opinion that the immediate need for such immense resources results from the potential of a severe influenza pandemic combined with many years of inadequate attention to lung infections. As of the time of writing this essay, the US Congress has yet to approve funding, and it remains unclear how much will be approved and how it will be deployed if approved, but a discrete set of funds may soon become available for fighting influenza specifically.Efforts and Resources Marshalled against Lung InfectionsIt is more difficult to assess resources distributed by private organizations, but it is again evident that lung infections are underemphasized. U.S. News and World Report identifies 20 charities as the largest to deal specifically with diseases and disease-related research [15]. Of these 20 leading charities, nine focus on cancer, two on organs (heart or kidney), two on classes of disease (mental illness or birth defects), and the rest on six specific diseases (muscular dystrophy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer disease, and arthritis). Perhaps the most prominent philanthropy focused specifically on infectious disease is The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria [16]. This fund reports that it has attracted commitments of US$4.7 billion from national governments, private companies, and other contributors for fighting these three specific diseases. Such philanthropies perform wonderful services in improving health. Lung infections would similarly benefit from such a major philanthropic focus.Infectious Disease through the Prism of MicrobiologyWhy does the consistent burden of lung infections receive so little attention? It may result in part from our tendency to view infectious diseases from a microbiology perspective. Microbes can reasonably be portrayed and perceived as enemies to be attacked and defeated. Smallpox eradication is a powerful illustration of the potential of such an approach. Because AIDS is caused by HIV, malaria by Plasmodia, tuberculosis by Mycobacteria, and so on, defeating HIV and Plasmodia and Mycobacteria are widely recognized as valid goals in virtually any informed community.Infectious Disease through the Prism of MicrobiologyWhile the idea of fighting against a specific microbe is attractive, and such an “us-against-them” mentality is effective at mobilizing commitments, a microbe-specific focus is appropriate for some infectious diseases more than others. Lung infections do not result from one or a few extremely virulent microbes especially adapted to living in our lungs. Rather, a tremendous variety of microbes causes lung infections, and a strategy focused on the microbes is destined to be a game of catch-up. The physiology of breathing requires our lungs to be enormously exposed to microbes, both from the external environment (the air) and from a microbe-rich part of our own anatomy (our upper airways). It is inevitable that microbes land in our lungs. In part for these reasons, respiratory infections are common, and new respiratory pathogens are likely to emerge frequently. Eliminating microbes in the lungs requires inflammatory responses that by their very nature compromise ventilation and blood-gas exchange. Thus, eliminating infection threatens physiology, and in part for this reason respiratory infections are often severe.Infectious Disease through the Prism of MicrobiologyTools are available for targeting some microbes causing lung infections (e.g., vaccines and antibiotics). Further research into reactive strategies directed specifically against individual microbes will likely improve our abilities to prevent or cure select lung infections. Few and marginally effective tools are available for targeting exposures or host responses to lung infection (e.g., ultraviolet germicidal irradiation or corticosteroids, respectively). Forward-thinking strategies might be directed at determinants of respiratory tract exposure, innate immune defenses against microbes in the lungs, and inflammatory injury resulting from lung infection. Advances in these areas will provide opportunities both to combat ongoing public health crises and to limit the potential threat from emerging pathogens.ConclusionLike the proverbial elephant in the room, lung infections are a persistent problem not receiving the attention required. This may result in part from the nature of a disease lacking a single clear etiologic agent identified as a microbiological enemy. Whatever the reasons, it means that an important cause of human suffering is relatively underserved. Because the burden of disease is so substantial, greater efforts designed to elucidate the biology of lung infections, to generate novel therapeutic or prophylactic strategies, and to better deliver interventions to needy populations have the potential for tremendous public health impact."
Relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of COPD,"Respiratory viruses play an important role in exacerbations of COPD and this has been increasingly recognised since the application of molecular detection methods [1,2]. The most prevalent viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction so far were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza 3. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus first isolated from a dutch child with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)[3]. World wide distribution is probable since it has been isolated in North America[4], Brasil[5], Japan[6], Australia[7] and the United Kingdom[8] from children with LRTI in the winter/spring seasons. Recent publications show a detection rate of 3.9 to 7% in children hospitalized for LRTI [9-12]. When outpatients are investigated for the presence of hMPV the detection rates are higher ranging from 6.2[13] to 12%[14].BackgroundHMPV has been recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae like RSV and it is not only associated with bronchiolitis in most cases, but also with pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma[14,15], diseases which share some features with COPD. Up to date reports about hMPV in adults are scarce. In a general Canadian population 14.8% of patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections were hMPV positive. Thirty-three percent of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized and the hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients below 5 years and those over 50 years of age[16]. In another prospective cohort of adults, hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses but also in 4.1% of asymptomatic subjects. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly[17]. HMPV infection can be severe since the virus was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia[18]. The role of hMPV in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) has been studied recently in outpatients and only low frequencies have been observed[17,19]. Up to now the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized with AE-COPD is unknown. Our aim was therefore to investigate the frequency of detection of hMPV in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to compare these results to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without COPD.Subjects ::: Subjects, material and methodsThree different groups were studied. The first group consisted of hospitalized patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD), the second group were subjects with stable COPD and the third group was composed of smokers without COPD. The groups were defined as previously published[20]. Briefly AE-COPD patients suffered from COPD as defined by GOLD[21]. Acute exacerbation was characterized by worsening in dyspnea, cough, and expectoration. A routine posterior-anterior chest radiograph was evaluated on admission by expert radiologists to exclude other other reasons for increased symptoms as pneumonia, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma or congestive heart failure.Stable COPD patients did not have an exacerbation within the last 30 days prior to hospital admission and had no changes in therapy within the last 14 days (including inhaled and oral medication) and had been admitted for other medical reasons into departments of internal medicine other than pulmonary care. COPD subjects were recruited in a 2:1 ratio each month in order to prevent seasonal selection bias. Smokers have been smoking more than 10 pack-years, could have chronic symptoms like cough and phlegm but did not report dyspnea and did not have bronchial obstruction (FEV1/FVC>70%, FEV1>80% predicted). None of the smokers had a history of COPD or asthma, nor was using systemic or topic pulmonary medication. The smokers were recruited either from our smoking cessation initiative or by newspaper advertisement.Subjects ::: Subjects, material and methodsThe study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ruhr-University of Bochum, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects before inclusion in the study.Diagnostic methods ::: Subjects, material and methodsClinical evaluation, spirometric tests, nasal lavage, induced sputum, specimen processing and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction were carried out as described by Rohde et al[2]. Elution volume was 100 μl. cDNA was generated with random-hexamer primers as previously published[2].Detection of hMPV by real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR ::: Subjects, material and methodsA hMPV-specific real-time RT-PCR designed and evaluated by Maertzdorf et al was used[22]. Primers and probe are localized within the nucleoprotein gene (NL-N) and the presence of a degenerate base within the probe allows detection of all four genetic lineages of hMPV.Detection of hMPV by real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR ::: Subjects, material and methodsThe assays were performed using the TaqMan® PCR Core Kit. The final volume was 25 μl containing 500 nM of the forward primer (NL-N-forward (5'-CATATAAGCATGCTATATTAAAAGAGTCTC-3')), 250 nM of the reverse primer (NL-N-reverse (5'-CCTATTTCTGCAGCATATTTGTAATCAG-3')) and 500 nM of the probe (NL-N-probe (5'-FAM-TGYAATGATGAGGGTGTCACTGCGGTTG-TAMRA-3', in which Y is either a C or a T residue). Nuclease-free water was used as negative control and a plasmid containing the N gene of hMPV (kindly provided by James Simon, VIRONOVATIVE, EUR Holding, Erasmus University Rotterdam) was used as a positive control in all PCR runs. Cycling parameters were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Amplification and detection of RNA from virus isolates or clinical specimens were performed using the GeneAmp® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The real-time PCR product was cloned with the QIAGEN® PCR cloning kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and this standard plasmid DNA was used for absolute quantification of hMPV viral load. Calculations were performed as previously described for absolute quantification of RSV viral load[23].Statistical analysis ::: Subjects, material and methodsThe primary objective of this study was to compare the frequency of hMPV detection in respiratory specimens between COPD patients with or without an acute exacerbation and smokers without COPD.Statistical analysis ::: Subjects, material and methodsContinuous data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were of non-parametrical distribution and results were expressed as median and range. Differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test. To further analyse significant differences between two individual groups a pair wise comparison by two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. All significance levels were set to 5%. Data were analysed and processed using SPSS Version 12.0 on a Windows XP operating system.Clinical symptoms ::: ResultsA total of 229 subjects were investigated between October 1999 and June 2004: 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. The clinical characteristics and lung function measurements are summarized in table 1. FEV1, FEV1 in % of predicted value and FEV1/FVC were normal in smokers, significantly decreased in stable COPD patients (all) and further significantly decreased in AE-COPD patients (all p < 0.05 compared to stable COPD and all p < 0.001 compared to smokers).Prevalence of hMPV ::: ResultsHMPV could be detected in three subjects. All these subjects were AE-COPD patients. The prevalence of hMPV in AE-COPD patients was 2.3%. The virus was simultaneously detected in nasal lavage and induced sputum in one patient only. The viral load was about 100 times higher in nasal lavage than in induced sputum in this patient. Overall the viral load in nasal lavage was about 3.5 times higher compared to induced sputum (for details see table 2). The hMPV positive patients did not differ significantly from other AE-COPD patients when clinical parameters and lung function were analysed. hMPV was detected in the winter season only.DiscussionThe main finding of this controlled study investigating the incidence of hMPV in subjects with COPD and smokers without COPD is that this recently discovered respiratory virus was detectable only during exacerbation of COPD. The frequency of detection was very low but in positive cases the viral load was considerable. There was no detection in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD.DiscussionOur findings are in agreement with other studies in adults. Recently Vicente et al[19] reported about the incidence of hMPV in 89 COPD patients. Five patients (5.5%) were hMPV positive. Two of these patients had to be transferred to hospital. Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2]. There is another prospective cohort study of adults in which hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities[17]. Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data[24]. A further recent study found hMPV in two out of 111 adult patients (1.8%) who presented to the emergency department for AE-COPD during 2 winter/spring seasons in Quebec, Canada, also in support of our findings[25]. In a US American study investigating clinical samples collected between 1991 and 1995, hMPV could not be detected at all in 196 patients indicating important geographical and seasonal differences in hMPV prevalence[26]. Taken together the results presented here are in keeping with other studies in adults and add important information on the prevalence of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD.DiscussionTo our knowledge this is the first study analysing the viral load of hMPV in COPD patients. We found a mean of 6.5 × 105 viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 105 viral copies/ml in induced sputum. These values indicate that hMPV may have been the infectious agent triggering exacerbation in these patients. Viral load cut-off values for infectivity in COPD exacerbations have not been studied in detail yet and need further investigation. However, viral loads between 1120 copies/ml in Cytomegalovirus infection in lung-transplant patients[27] and 5.8log10 copies/ml in SARS[28] have been considered to indicate infectious disease. Moreover hMPV was only found in acute exacerbation and not in stable disease or in smokers without COPD supporting a triggering role in AE-COPD.DiscussionHMPV infection can be severe since it was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia[18]. Our hMPV positive patients did not differ in their clinical characteristics or lung function from the other AE-COPD patients which does not indicate a more severe course of AE-COPD in these patients.ConclusionTaken together this is the first controlled study on the relevance of hMPV in hospitalized AE-COPD. HMPV was detected in a very low frequency but with noticeable viral load in AE-COPD patients. Given that asymptomatic carriage of hMPV is very unlikely it should be considered as another possible trigger of AE-COPD. Since every AE-COPD has considerable impact on the course of the disease and regional outbreaks of hMPV are possible it should be included into future diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.List of abbreviationsAE-COPD = Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseList of abbreviationsFEV1 = Forced Expiratory Volume in one secondList of abbreviationsFVC = Functional Vital CapacityList of abbreviationsGOLD = Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung DiseaseList of abbreviationsLRTI = Lower Respiratory Tract InfectionList of abbreviationshMPV = human MetapneumovirusList of abbreviationsNL-N = Nucleoprotein gene of hMPVList of abbreviationsRSV = Respiratory Syncytial VirusList of abbreviationsRT-PCR = Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain ReactionList of abbreviationsRNA = Ribonucleic AcidCompeting interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsGR contributed to the conception and design of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.

Seasonality of Respiratory Viral Infections: Will COVID-19 Follow Suit?,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus (CoV) to emerge in the twenty-first century (1). The earliest cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the epicenter of the outbreak (1). Since then, the virus has been rapidly spreading across the globe (2).IntroductionCoVs are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that commonly infect birds and mammals, causing a wide range of pathological conditions (3). These viruses undergo frequent mutations and recombinations, yielding new variants that can cross the species barrier (3). Since 1960, seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been identified to cause infections among humans (4). Human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 are common in the human population and are responsible for about 15–30% of the annual respiratory tract infections (5). They are commonly associated with mild and self-limiting symptoms. Still, severe illnesses, accompanied by lower respiratory tract infection, might also occur, especially in elderly, neonates, and patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors (5).IntroductionIn the current millennium, three highly pathogenic CoVs, SARS-CoV-1 (6), the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (7), and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (1), have crossed the species barrier and resulted in human infections. SARS-CoV-1 was first detected in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 and then rapidly spread to Hong Kong and 29 other countries, resulting in more than 8000 confirmed cases, including 774 deaths (6, 8). By July 2003, the virus died out throughout the world. MERS-CoV was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with the camels being the source for human infections (9). The virus caused a total of 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 866 associated deaths as of the end of January 2020 (7). The majority of cases were detected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), in addition to one major outbreak in South Korea (10).IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus that is associated with severe pneumonia cases (11). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease) as Public Health Emergency of International Concern after it affected 7,818 people with 170 deaths in 19 countries, including China (12). Since late February, the number of reported COVID-19 cases along with the number of affected countries had sharply increased within a short period, which led the WHO to declare the global COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (13). Since then, the number of globally confirmed COVID-19 cases has been increasing exponentially, resulting in nearly more than 21 million confirmed cases and 761,000 fatalities as of August 16, 2020 (14).IntroductionDifferent approaches and interventions have been adopted to contain and control the disease spread including travel restrictions (global), partial or complete lockdowns (e.g., China and Singapore) (15, 16) and/or massive testing and isolation of confirmed cases and their contacts (South Korea) (17). The reluctance and delayed implementation of multilayered public health measures in some countries (e.g., Italy, Iran, the UK, Brazil, and the US) resulted in dire outcomes. Despite all the efforts and measures to contain the virus, it is still spreading globally, traversing all climate and environmental settings (2).IntroductionNearly every acute viral disease has a particular seasonal window of occurrence, which differs according to the geographic location and environmental conditions (18). The incidence of respiratory viral infections is highly affected by seasonal changes, especially in temperate climates (19). Extensive research has been done to better understand the seasonality of respiratory viruses. Yet, our knowledge about this phenomenon remains limited. Here we attempt to address the possible impact of weather on SARS-CoV-2 spread, taking into consideration the current knowledge regarding its stability and transmission patterns, and the behavior of other respiratory viruses.Seasonality of Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory VirusesMost viral respiratory infections tend to follow seasonal patterns with high incidence during winter in temperate regions and during the rainy season in tropical regions (20). Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have a single annual seasonal peak during winter in the Northern and Southern temperate regions (21). These viruses peak from December to March in the Northern hemisphere, and between June and August in the Southern hemisphere (21). Parainfluenza viruses have a seasonal peak from April to June in the Northern temperate sites and during September in the Southern temperate areas (21). In most of the tropical regions, these viruses occur year-round with increased incidence in rainy seasons (21, 22). Rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, two non-enveloped respiratory viruses, are known to circulate throughout the year in all climatic regions with occasional peaks in autumn and winter for rhinoviruses and in winter and early spring for adenoviruses (23, 24).Seasonality of Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory VirusesEpidemiologic studies of common cold HCoVs suggest that they exhibit a seasonal pattern. In a temperate climate, HCoV infections are primarily detected in winter and spring, with low-level circulation throughout the year (3). The early known types, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, predominantly circulate during the winter season in temperate climate countries (25, 26). An eight-year study of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E among young adults in the US reported an equal number of infections with these two types during the winter (December through February) and spring season (March through May) (27). In Belgium, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were only detected in winter and early spring (28). Several other studies from the United States, Belgium, France, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Italy, and Germany consistently reported winter circulation of the other two HCoVs: NL63 and HKU1 (28–36).Seasonality of Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory VirusesOn the other hand, tropical/subtropical regions display year-round circulation of HCoVs but with increased activity during certain months. A study conducted in China during 2008–2009 reported that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 infections, in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections, showed increased activity during summer, fall, and winter (37). In another 7-year epidemiologic study between 2009 and 2016 in China, HCoVs circulated year-round but with the highest incidence during the spring and autumn (38). A study by Chiu et al., in Hong Kong, showed that HCoV-NL63 infections were notable during the spring and summer months of 2002, whereas HCoV-OC43 infections mainly occurred during the fall and winter of 2001 (39). Additionally, a study from Thailand confirmed the previous findings and reported the peak of HCoV-OC43 activity in winter, whereas HCoV-NL63 frequently occurred in autumn (40). In Australia, HCoV-NL63 peaks in mid-winter but was also detected between late-autumn and early-spring (41). Studies from some African countries (South Africa and Ghana) also reported a year-round circulation of HCoVs (42, 43).Seasonality of Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory VirusesDespite its rapid spread to about 30 countries, the SARS-CoV-1 was quickly contained. Thus, it was not possible to assess its seasonality. In the case of MERS-CoV, seven years have passed since its emergence and is still causing intermittent and sporadic infections without obvious seasonality (10). In fact, MERS-CoV has demonstrated low ability to transmit between humans, and most of the outbreaks have occurred mainly in healthcare settings. In camels, the virus seems to peak between late-winter and early-summer (44). This coincides with a spike in zoonotic transmission between April and July (45). A 5-year epidemiologic study, conducted between 2012 and 2017, demonstrated that MERS-CoV has the highest global seasonal occurrence during June with some observed seasonal variations (46). A case-cross-over analysis of the associations between primary human MERS cases and weather conditions found that the primary MERS infections are more likely to occur in cold and dry conditions (47).Seasonality of Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory VirusesIn summary, most respiratory viruses follow a seasonal pattern. However, some factors might increase the incidence of these infections, even in seasons with low circulation. For instance, an increased incidence of respiratory infections occurs among pilgrims during the Hajj Season (48). The mass crowding in a limited space, in addition to the close contact between pilgrims, increases the risk of viral importation and transmission, particularly the respiratory ones (49) Rhinovirus, influenza virus, and the common cold HCoVs (mainly HCoV-229E) are usually the most commonly detected viruses during the Hajj (48).Effect of Meteorological Factors on the Stability and Transmission of Respiratory Viruses ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesA study by Price et al. demonstrated that unlike the non-enveloped viruses that circulate throughout the year, enveloped viruses, including influenza and RSV, tend to be more seasonal, with a clear preference for colder temperatures (20). Harper et al. found that the optimal airborne influenza survival is at low temperatures and the survival decreases as the temperature increases (52). Low temperatures seem to enhance the lipid ordering of the viral envelope and improve influenza virus stability (53). This enhances the virus's ability to stay protected outside the body for a longer period of time (54). Further, a systematic review examined the factors that affect influenza survival on different metrics revealed that longer virus survival is favored at lower temperatures (55).Effect of Meteorological Factors on the Stability and Transmission of Respiratory Viruses ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesBesides their effect on stability, low temperature and relative humidity are also shown to enhance aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses (52). It was proposed that influenza virus transmission occurs mostly by aerosols in temperate regions and by contact in tropical sites (56). Using the guinea pig model, Lowen et al. showed that influenza virus aerosol transmission is suppressed by high humidity and warm temperature, but enhanced under cold and dry conditions (57). Low relative humidity induces evaporation of water from the exhaled bio-aerosols, leading to the formation of droplet nuclei (1–5 μm in size) (58). The extent of infectious viral particles survival in dried aerosols is not known; however, it is speculated that these nuclei can stay suspended in the air for prolonged periods (58). The opposite happens at high relative humidity, whereby the respiratory droplets increase in size by taking on water from the surrounding and quickly settle out of the air, thus, decrease aerosol transmission of the virus (58).Effect of Meteorological Factors on the Stability and Transmission of Respiratory Viruses ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesOn the other hand, the transmission of influenza viruses by contact was shown to be efficient even at high humidity (54). High humidity enhances the indirect virus transmission by increasing the virus particle's stability, inside droplets, on surfaces (54). A study by Yang et al. showed that humidity promotes the survival of influenza A virus by controlling the extent of evaporation in these virus-containing droplets, which affect the solute concentrations and thus, viral stability (59). This partially explains the year-round occurrence of viral respiratory infections in tropical regions, particularly during rainy seasons when humidity is high.Effect of Meteorological Factors on the Stability and Transmission of Respiratory Viruses ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesIn addition, it is well-known that solar UV radiation (UV) of all wavelengths effectively inactivate RNA and DNA viruses to varying extents (60, 61). Three types of UV radiations, UVA, UVB, and UVC, exist in nature, with UVC, having the shortest wavelength range, being the most effective against viruses (62). However, only UVA and UVB radiations are found at the ground-level sunlight, and these are known to have lower efficiency against viruses (60). The low incidence of respiratory infections during summer in temperate regions can also be attributed to the solar inactivation of viruses on the outdoor surfaces contaminated with respiratory secretions, thus decreasing the possibility of fomite transmission.Effect of Meteorological Factors on Host's Susceptibility to Infection ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesMeteorological or environmental conditions were also shown to have a direct effect on the host's susceptibility to infections (63). The role of cold weather in weakening the immune response is controversial (63, 64). However, many studies indicated that cold and dry environments have an immunosuppressive effect on the host, and thereby increase the risk of acquiring infections (65–67). Increased exposure to cold air was shown to induce a temperature-related reduction in lung function in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (68). Seasonal changes in temperature were also shown to affect the local immune response in the nose (66). It was shown that the antiviral defense response against rhinovirus infection in cultured mouse airway cells is reduced at low temperature (69). The cooling of the nasal airway by the inhaled cold air induces a decrease in the temperature of the respiratory epithelium, and compromise both the mucociliary clearance (MCC) in the nose and the local immune response in the upper airway (66).Effect of Meteorological Factors on Host's Susceptibility to Infection ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesThe nasal respiratory epithelium is made up of ciliated cells covered with an airway surface layer comprised of a mucus layer that catches inhaled particles and low viscosity pericilliary layer that moisturizes the surfaces and enable ciliary beating (70). MCC is a key mechanism required for getting rid of particles, including infectious agents, stuck on the surface of the respiratory epithelium (70). Production of thin mucosal layer and beating of cilia at a specific frequency are considered key factors for efficient MCC (66). MCC was shown to be affected by temperature and relative humidity. A recent study demonstrated that MCC and epithelial cellular repair in influenza virus-infected cells is reduced at a low relative humidity (67). Using a climate chamber for cell culture, a study showed that a temperature of 25°C and RH of 40% induced more production of mucin compared to 37°C and 80% RH (71). In addition, it was shown that tracheal and nasal mucociliary beat frequency decreases as the temperature falls below 20°C and totally ceases at 5°C (72). These studies indicate that low temperature and low humidity in the nasal airway compromise the MCC by increasing mucin secretion and reducing mucociliary beat frequency (67, 71, 73). Moreover, a study done on guinea pigs revealed that breathing dry air can disrupt cilia, damage epithelial cells, and induce local inflammation of the trachea (74). More importantly, the phagocytic activity of macrophages, a key non-specific immune response mechanism against viruses, was found to be reduced both in vivo and in vitro at low temperatures (75).Effect of Meteorological Factors on Host's Susceptibility to Infection ::: Drivers of Seasonality of Respiratory VirusesIt has also been postulated that shortened exposure to sunlight during the winter affects vitamin D levels, a key modulator for both innate and adaptive immune responses, which increases the susceptibility to respiratory infections during winter (76, 77). A systematic review assessing the relation between vitamin D and respiratory tract infections found that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of respiratory tract infections (78). The high incidence of influenza was also correlated with the seasonal decrease in vitamin D levels (79). A recent observational study of 212 patients from three South Asian hospitals, found a positive association between vitamin D levels and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients (80).Modes of SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionThe respiratory transmission mode of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. However, the virus is assumed to have a transmission pattern similar to that of the influenza virus (81). These modes include transmission through direct or indirect contact with infected individuals. Transmission of the virus can occur via fomites or direct contact with an infected person or through respiratory droplets released during sneezing, coughing, or talking (82). Studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 can stay viable on surfaces for hours or even days especially in healthcare facilities where the concentration of the virus released by the patients is relatively high (82–84). The survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on relative humidity and temperature and on the nature of the contaminated surfaces (85, 86).Modes of SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionAlthough airborne virus transmission has not yet been confirmed in humans, studies suggest that the occurrence of aerosol transmission cannot be excluded, especially in closed venues (82, 87). Airborne transmission occurs when the aerosols (droplet nuclei <5 μm) containing infectious viral particles spread in air over a long distance and remain suspended for a long time (82). These aerosols are produced from evaporation of large respiratory droplets or released from the infected individuals by coughing, sneezing, talking, or exhaling. The aerosols can be breathed by individuals and cause infection if enough infectious dose of the virus is present or upon extended exposure (82). A study by Van Dormalan et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 virus particles remained infectious for 3 h in experimentally generated virus-containing aerosols that mimic the human-generated ones (83). Several studies reported detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air samples collected from different areas inside the hospitals such as patients' toilet areas, medical staff areas, and public areas prone to crowding (83, 88, 89). Recently, it was shown that infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in air samples collected 2–4.8 m away from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, supporting the possibility of airborne transmission at least in confined environments (90).Modes of SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionThe possibility of transmission via the fecal-oral or fecal-respiratory route has been also considered for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were also found in urine and feces of infected patients (91–95). However, no evidence on virus transmission through feces or urine exists (91–95). Some studies also reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA but not infectious virus in blood samples of COVID-19 patients and breast milk of infected mothers (91, 96, 97). The absence of viable virus in blood and breast milk excludes the possibility of virus transmission through these routes (91, 96, 97).Modes of SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionControlling the transmission of respiratory viruses is very challenging on its own, but is even more complicated in the case of SARS-CoV-2 due to the well-demonstrated role of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers (98–101). A meta-analysis of nine studies from six countries (including 21,035 close contacts of 843 COVID-19 cases) estimated the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers at 15% (95% CI 12–18%). The transmission rates ranged from 0 to 2.2% for aymptomatic cases compared to 0.8–15.4% among symptomatic ones (102). Lau et al. estimated the presymptomatic transmission proportion to be 44% (95% CI, 30–57%) with infectiousness peaking between 2 days before and 1 day after symptoms onset (103). While a study carried out in Singapore found that around 6.4 % of the secondary infections are caused by the pre-symptomatic patients (104).Role of Meteorological Factors During SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionThe seasonal differences between the Southern and Northern hemispheres might have played a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Early in the pandemic, Northern hemisphere countries with cold climates appeared to be the most vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission, while tropical regions and those in the Southern hemisphere seemed to be the least affected. Initial studies suggested a potential role for meterological factors in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Sajadi et al. found more virus spread in areas with an average temperature of 5–11°C and absolute humidity of 4–7 g/m3, suggesting a potentially seasonal behavior (105). Another study found that around 90% of the cases were reported in countries with temperatures maxima below 17°C and absolute humidity of 3–9 g/m3. The study suggested that the summer season might reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in those countries as the temperatures rise (106). Another study concluded that SARS-CoV-2 transmits more easily in countries with relatively cool conditions and that transmission is reduced in sites with high temperatures and high relative humidity (107). Chen et al. reported that the optimal temperature for virus spread was found to be at 8°C and humidity between 60 and 90%. The authors suggested that the weather plays a key role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 around the world (108).Role of Meteorological Factors During SARS-CoV-2 TransmissionThe association between the daily incidence of COVID-19 cases and climatic conditions in mainland China was examined between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Using modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, Shi et al. found that COVID-19 transmission rate decreased at higher temperatures (109). However, another study conducted during the same period in China concluded that the increase in humidity and temperature alone would not reduce the virus spread if the public health interventions have not been strictly implemented (110). Similarly, a prospective cohort study done on 144 different areas other than China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy, found that it is the strict interventions that are strongly associated with the decrease in virus transmission but not latitude and temperature (111). Nonetheless, the early lockdowns in some countries and variable public interventions taken by various countries hindered the ability of scientists to study the association between climate and virus transmission. The aforementioned studies are also being challenged by the fact that many countries in the Northern hemisphere are witnessing a second wave of COVID-19 despite entering the summer season.Conclusion: Will COVID-19 Become Seasonal?The basic reproduction number (R0) is the number of secondary cases resulting from a primary case in a susceptible population and is an important indicator to predict the spread of a virus. For a virus to follow a seasonal pattern, and thus wane in summer, its effective R0 should drop below 1 (112). For SARS-CoV, the R0 is estimated between 2 and 3 (112) and in some estimates as high as 5.7 (113). As discussed above, several factors in the summer might reduce the effective R0 of respiratory viruses including the effect of warm tempertures and humidity on the stability of the virus and susceptibility of the host as well as behavior of the population such as indoor crowding. For seasonal influenza virus, its R0 is estimated to be 1.27 (114). Therefore, these aforementioned factors could easily drop the effective R0 to below 1 in summer halting the virus spread and resulting in the observed seasonal pattern of flu. The warm temperatures and humidity of the summer might impact the host immune response and thus its susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 similar to its effect on influenza (66). However, other factors including: (1) a much higher R0, (2) higher stability of SARS-CoV-2 (it can survive for up to 72 h on hard surfaces at temperatures between 21 and 23°C and in relative humidity of 40%) (83), and (3) a largely immunologically naïve population against SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza make it unlikely for the R0 to drop in summer enough to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, without public health interventions, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread in summer as witnessed in many countries around the world. Nonetheless, as the population herd immunity is attained through natural infections and/or vaccinations then the effective R0 is expected to drop substantially making the virus more prone to seasonal fluctuations.Author ContributionsHZ conceived the review idea and supervised the writing.

 SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan,"Historically, Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) have been more severely affected by influenza pandemics than any other part of the world. As an extreme example, during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Western Samoa (now Samoa) experienced the loss of 19-22% of its population [1]. On the other hand, also during the 1918 pandemic, four Pacific island nations were able to delay or prevent introduction of the influenza virus through strict application of maritime quarantine. Eventually, all experienced infection after the quarantine was lifted, but delay in introduction seems to have helped reduce the impact [1]. One area, the remote Lau and Yasawa islands of Fiji, is the only known Pacific area that appears to have avoided the 1918 pandemic altogether [2]. By 2009, all PICTs except for Tokelau and Pitcairn Islands could be reached by commercial air line, making timely quarantine unrealistic for most.BackgroundOn 25 April 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergence of novel H1N1 influenza in Mexico a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [3]. In response, PICTs that were not already conducting surveillance were requested to initiate influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance in their main health facilities.BackgroundIn the Pacific, the 22 PICTs, consisting of American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), New Zealand, Palau, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis & Futuna are supported by WHO Division of Pacific Technical Support (WHO DPS) based in Suva, Fiji. For the purposes of this analysis, New Zealand is not included amongst the PICTs. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is included in this report. Thus this paper is based on data received from 23 PICTs.BackgroundThe objectives of this study were to describe the epidemiology, characteristics (including a summary of fatal cases), and control measures against the H1N1 pandemic in the Pacific, until the declaration of the end of the pandemic on August 10th, 2010.MethodsDuring the beginning of the pandemic in May 2009, the WHO DPS requested PICTs to initiate influenza-like-illness (ILI) surveillance (if not already in place) and report cases of ILI and cases of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1. ILI was defined as a case-patient with fever (measured or reported) with cough and/or sore throat. Most PICTs conducted ILI surveillance in one or two locations, usually their main health centre(s).MethodsWhen cases of ILI were identified, WHO DPS and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) requested PICTs to collect two nasopharyngeal samples per patient. Samples were referred to reference laboratories on viral transport media with dry ice or in ethanol, depending on the duration of transport. The majority of PICTs in the South Pacific sent samples to the WHO Collaborating Centre in Melbourne, with the exception of Cook Islands and Samoa, which sent specimens to New Zealand. Countries in the North Pacific referred specimens to Hawaii. Testing was no longer recommended once cases of pH1N1 were confirmed within a country unless PCR was available in-country, as is the case in French Polynesia, Fiji, Guam, and New Caledonia.MethodsWHO Headquarters requested that all Member States report deaths related to laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 using a standardised case summary form; in the Pacific, these were collated by the WHO DPS.MethodsData were gathered through weekly email reports from the PICTs. Where data were not provided or additional information was needed, email or telephone follow-up was conducted. A weekly summary report was disseminated by WHO through PacNet, the email mailing list and communication tool of the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network, to which health officials from all PICTs subscribe.MethodsCase counts of ILI and confirmed pH1N1 were tabulated and analysed in Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redding, Washington, USA). Maps displaying the number of pandemic influenza H1N1 confirmed cases reported to WHO by PICTs were also created every week by SPC using a prototype Population Geographic Information System called PopGIS [4].MethodsControl measures employed by PICTs were determined through reports from PICTs to WHO DPS and SPC.Epidemiology of ILI and confirmed pH1N1 in PICTs ::: ResultsHawaii and New Zealand were the first jurisdictions in the Pacific region to detect pH1N1 cases in late April, 2009. The PICTs started detecting ILI cases in May, with cases first being reported in French Polynesia and Palau in May, followed by the rest of the PICTs and finally Tuvalu in August. Sixteen PICTs reported a total of 16,784 cases of ILI, with a peak occurring in August 2009 [Figure 1]. CNMI, PNG, Samoa and Tuvalu did not report ILI data to WHO DPS in 2009.Epidemiology of ILI and confirmed pH1N1 in PICTs ::: ResultsConfirmed cases of pH1N1 followed the same pattern and were firstly reported from French Polynesia in June, following the arrival of a tourist from Boston, USA, with the last new detection occurring in August in Tuvalu [Figure 2]. Nineteen PICTs reported 1,972 confirmed cases with a peak in week 3 in August 2009. Four PICTs accounted for 64% (n=1,262) of these confirmed cases: New Caledonia (n=501), Guam (n=341), Fiji (n=235), and French Polynesia (n=185). These were the only PICTs that had laboratory capacity to confirm pH1N1 in-country using PCR; other PICTS had to ship their samples for confirmation to an overseas laboratory. Maps displaying the number of pandemic influenza H1N1 confirmed cases reported to WHO by PICTs were also created every week using PopGIS.Absence of confirmed pH1N1 in three PICTs ::: ResultsNo confirmed pH1N1 cases were identified in Niue, Pitcairn and Tokelau [Figure 3].Absence of confirmed pH1N1 in three PICTs ::: ResultsNiue, a small single-island country with a population of approximately 1,500, can be reached by a weekly flight from Auckland, New Zealand, or by cargo ship, which sails once every 3–4 weeks. The Niue health authorities instituted health screening at the airport and seaport beginning in early May, and coordinated with authorities in New Zealand to screen passengers bound for Niue in Auckland; this resulted in denial of travel for at least 2 symptomatic individuals. A peak of influenza-like-illness occurred in July (61 reported cases). Five nasopharyngeal swabs were sent to New Zealand for influenza testing; all were negative [5]. However, all of these samples were collected late in the outbreak, after fever had subsided in most patients (personal communication, Mr Manila Nosa, Niue health department).Absence of confirmed pH1N1 in three PICTs ::: ResultsPitcairn Islands, a British overseas territory with a population of approximately 50, is accessible only by ship from Mangareva, Gambier Islands, French Polynesia, which, in turn, is accessed by a flight from the French Polynesian capital of Papeete [6]. In addition, the main island is a popular stop for cruise ships. Throughout the pandemic, the medical doctor on Pitcairn did not report cases of influenza-like illness among islanders.Absence of confirmed pH1N1 in three PICTs ::: ResultsTokelau, a country consisting of 3 atolls with a total population of approximately 1,200 persons, can only be reached by ship, which makes the voyage every 2 weeks from Apia, Samoa; it takes 2 to 4 days to reach each of the atolls. Starting in May 2009, the Tokelau government required that persons planning to travel to one of the atolls wait a minimum of 7 days in Apia before boarding. Persons with ILI symptoms were not allowed to embark. Passengers on the boat were monitored for signs of influenza. Upon disembarkation, passengers were placed in isolation, either on an uninhabited islet, which had been prepared to cater for them, or in dedicated isolation buildings. After another 7 days without symptoms, these persons were finally allowed to join the rest of the population on the atoll. Nine ILI cases were reported; one in June and 8 in August; 5 nasopharyngeal swab samples from these persons were negative for influenza in a reference lab. When the pH1N1 vaccine became available in 2010, Tokelau, with assistance from New Zealand, vaccinated the entire population aged 2 and older [7].Deaths ::: ResultsSeven PICTs reported 21 deaths in confirmed case-patients of pH1N1, all of them in 2009 [Table 1]. Three countries completed WHO case summary forms; the remaining case data were elicited by email or telephone.Deaths ::: ResultsSixty-two per cent (n=13) of reported deaths were among females. Ages ranged from 6 weeks to 73 years, with a median age of 27 years.Deaths ::: ResultsAmong the fatal cases, cough was the most commonly reported symptom (n=18, 86%). Other symptoms reported were fever (n=17, 81%), shortness of breath (n=12, 57%), muscle pain (n=4, 19%), headache (n=4, 19%), vomiting (n=4, 19%), runny nose (n=2, 10%), diarrhoea (n=1), sneezing (n=1) and sore throat (n=1).Deaths ::: ResultsFatal case-patients had an onset of illness from 1 July 2009 to 14 September 2009. Duration of illness prior to death ranged from 1 day to 27 days, with a median of 11 days. Sixty-two per cent (n=13) of case-patients were hospitalised prior to death.Deaths ::: ResultsCause of death was reported for 17 (81%) case-patients. Case-patients died of either acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=7, 33%) or multi-organ failure (n=6, 29%), or a combination of both (n=4, 19%) [Table 2].Deaths ::: ResultsInformation about pre-existing conditions was available for 20 case-patients. Four (19%) case-patients had no reported pre-existing conditions or risk factors for severe disease. Pre-existing conditions reported were: morbid obesity/obesity (n=5, 24%), lung disease (n=4, 19%), heart disease (n=3, 14%), pregnancy (n=3, 14%), diabetes (n=1), immunodeficiency (n=1), cerebral palsy (n=1), prematurity in an infant (n=1) and genetic disorder (mitochondrial disease) (n=1). Three case-patients were reported to have more than one pre-existing condition/risk factor.Deaths ::: ResultsAntiviral therapy (oseltamivir) was prescribed for 10 case-patients (48%) (data available for all case-patients). Antibiotics were prescribed for 10 (48%) case-patients (data not known for 9 case-patients). Four case-patients received both antiviral and antibiotic therapy.Control methods ::: ResultsMost PICTs activated their pandemic plans at the start of the pandemic. All PICTs communicated public health messages to their public through a variety of media. These included advice to seek healthcare when ill, especially if one had risk factors; to avoid close contact with symptomatic persons; to stay away from work or school when ill; and to observe good hand- and cough/sneeze hygiene. All PICTs had access to antiviral drugs (oseltamivir), though these were mostly used for treatment rather than prevention. To the best of our knowledge, no PICTs instituted internal controls on movement to limit community spread. In most PICTs (as in many other countries around the world), until cases of pH1N1 were confirmed from within their jurisdictions, authorities placed great emphasis on instituting arrival health screening of airline passengers.Control methods ::: ResultsMany PICTs had pre-positioned personal protective equipment, antiviral medications, laboratory equipment and other supplies necessary to control the spread of infection. During the pandemic, WHO received vaccine donations sufficient to immunize 10% of the population of 95 selected countries worldwide. In the Pacific, this included 12 countries (Fiji, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu); there was, however, substantial delay in the receipt of vaccine in several of these jurisdictions and most received vaccine in early 2010. Some PICTs, notably those affiliated with large metropolitan governments, i.e. Cook Islands, Tokelau, Niue, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia, received vaccine late 2009. Situation updates and control advice were provided by regional partners such as WHO, SPC, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).DiscussionPandemic influenza spread rapidly throughout the Pacific despite enormous distances and relative isolation. PICTs that first identified pH1N1 were those that receive many tourists, either by cruise ship or plane, from countries where pandemic influenza had already been circulating. Only three jurisdictions did not report confirmed cases. Of these, Niue experienced an outbreak of influenza-like illness during high pandemic influenza activity in the region, so it is not possible to exclude the possibility that pH1N1 infection was present, despite several negative swab samples. Pitcairn’s tiny population of approximately 50 may have experienced a small number of influenza-like-illness cases, which went undetected, or perhaps their extreme isolation prevented introduction of the virus. Tokelau thus may have been the only country in the world that was able to keep the pandemic out, through strict maritime quarantine. To verify these findings, serosurveys could be considered.DiscussionAuthorities in several PICTs placed great emphasis on instituting arrival health screening of airline passengers; in many cases, this came at significant expense and at the sacrifice of routine public health services because healthcare workers were diverted from their regular duties to staff airport arrival areas. Most of these screening efforts involved measurement of temperature, either with infrared detection devices or with plain thermometers. While it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions, it is likely that this approach was ineffective in substantially delaying arrival of influenza in any PICT, due to the low sensitivity of the temperature screening method [8]; the fact that many passengers would have taken paracetamol or other NSAIDs to reduce a fever; and the possibility of arrival of infected passengers still in the incubation period. WHO and other agencies therefore advised focusing instead on community-level surveillance and control measures [9].DiscussionMost PICTs were well-prepared for the arrival of the pandemic, as there had been a strong emphasis prior to the pandemic on pre-pandemic planning and capacity-building by WHO, USCDC, and SPC, the latter through the “Pacific Regional Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Project” (PRIPPP) funded by Australia and New Zealand. One challenge faced by PICTs during the pH1N1 pandemic was the difficulty in applying advice aimed at the global level to the unique local circumstances found in the Pacific. Notably, several PICT authorities experienced frustration at being advised that countries should not institute border closure, while at the same time being cognizant of the history of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the Pacific and the very real possibility of excluding infection by instituting strict border controls. All PICTs had pandemic preparedness plans in place, though, as in other countries, challenges were encountered when trying to apply these plans, developed for worst-case-scenarios along the lines of a pandemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza, to a pandemic with a much milder profile. For instance, several PICTs had plans that called for automatic closure of borders upon the declaration of Pandemic Phase 6. A few PICTs closed their air- and seaports to travelers for up to two weeks but found it impossible to sustain this measure for the long term. A major lesson learned, therefore, was the need to make future pandemic (or emerging disease) plans flexible enough to accommodate varying degrees of severity.DiscussionFour PICTs reported 63% of all cases of pH1N1. Each of these PICTs had laboratories able to confirm pH1N1, which likely resulted in a greater proportion of ILI cases being confirmed. Further, laboratory capacity in these PICTs resulted in their cases being reported closer to the true onset date of the case and so it appears that the pandemic arrived earlier in these countries than in countries that relied on overseas laboratories to confirm the diagnosis. Once pH1N1 was identified in a PICT, confirmatory testing in overseas laboratories was no longer considered a priority for those PICTs without laboratories, thus underestimating the number of confirmed cases in these countries.DiscussionThe 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic had a relatively low impact in the Pacific, as compared with previous pandemics such as 1918 [1]. Nevertheless, the Pacific experienced significant morbidity and mortality, consis-tent with the experiences of other indigenous and low-resource settings throughout the world [10-12]. The highest mortality rate was in the Cook Islands with 9.1 deaths reported per 100,000 inhabitants. The mortality rates in the PICTs were ten-fold higher than most other countries reported during the same period [13]. The reasons for this are probably multifactorial, including: indigenous people and Pacific islanders have higher rates of pre-existing conditions, such as heart and lung disease, diabetes and obesity when compared with non-indigenous populations; there are relatively large numbers of children and pregnant women; access to health care and diagnostic services is often limited or delayed; and, larger family size and social networks, crowding, and poverty may increase the risk of infection. Our data also show that, during this pandemic, 19% of people who died did not have a pre-existing condition, a younger population was severely affected, and pregnant women were at risk for severe disease. These findings are consistent with other published reports [14-16]. Unfortunately, because most PICTs collected demographics and risk factor data only on fatal cases of pH1N1, it was not possible to perform statistical analysis to determine which, if any, of these risk factors were significantly associated with a fatal outcome.DiscussionThe computed case fatality rate (CFR) (1%), amongst laboratory-confirmed cases in the Pacific, appears high compared with published rates from other regions. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution. More severe cases of influenza are more likely to be tested and diagnosed with H1N1, which will over-estimate the CFR. Additionally, the majority of cases of influenza are not laboratory-confirmed due to limited laboratory capacity in PICTs, and limited influenza surveillance and detection of clinical case-patients in some places. Therefore, it is likely that the true number of case-patients of pandemic influenza H1N1 is far greater than diagnosed. It is also likely that not all deaths due to pandemic influenza H1N1 were recognised and reported. The mortality data have several limitations. Data collection was not standardised, as only three countries completed WHO case summary forms. The remaining case data were elicited by email or telephone and as a result data are incomplete for many case-patients. Pre-existing conditions are not well defined, so it is possible that different definitions are used within PICTs, e.g. heart disease may or may not include primary hypertension, and obesity may be defined as a body mass index greater than 30, 35 or even 40. Interpretation of the importance of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease and obesity is therefore not possible. Onset dates were estimated by reporting parties where information was not available. Finally, these data relate to a small number of cases.DiscussionSyndromic surveillance of influenza-like-illness showed a peak in cases in August and was a good predictor for subsequent laboratory confirmation of pH1N1. As with confirmed cases, the data on ILI should be interpreted with caution as ILI surveillance varied in extent between different PICTs and varied in intensity with the evolution of the pandemic. Further, the method of case ascertainment varied considerably amongst jurisdictions (for example, whether fever had to be documented or could merely be subjective), making it difficult to compare jurisdictions.ConclusionsFor the first time, regional ILI surveillance was conducted in the Pacific. This allowed PICTs and regional public health organizations to monitor the spread and severity of the pandemic in real-time. Establishing routine syndromic surveillance in PICTs is ongoing but appears to be an acceptable and useful tool for outbreak detection in these jurisdictions [17,18].ConclusionsFuture regional outbreak responses will likely benefit from the experiences and lessons learned during this influenza pandemic.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsJLK provided overall guidance to surveillance system design and data collection, analyzed data and contributed to the text of the manuscript.

Unfortunate Outcomes in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Superimposed on Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a worldwide pandemic that continues to overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. The virus can manifest in a wide range of presentations, from asymptomatic infections to severe acute respiratory syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Like in other respiratory virus infections, bacterial superinfections and coinfections have been reported in COVID-19 as well. Streptococcus pneumonia is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Identifying bacterial superinfections and coinfection in patients with COVID-19 infection can be difficult due to overlapping presentations, which in turn affect the management of these patients. We present a case of a patient who presented with fever and respiratory symptoms and was found to have pneumococcal pneumonia as well as COVID-19 infection.Case presentationAn 88-year-old male patient with a past medical history of dementia, coronary artery disease, repaired abdominal aortic aneurysm, dyslipidemia, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis presented with cough and shortness of breath of unclear duration. He was found on admission to be febrile, hypoxic, with oxygen saturation in the low 80s on room air, hypotensive, with sinus tachycardia. Initial chest X-ray showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates as seen in Figure 1. A repeat chest X-ray two days later showed more infiltrates on the left lower lobe as seen in Figure 2. A CT chest angiogram showed significant left lower lobe infiltrate as seen in Figure 3.Case presentationLabs were remarkable for marked leukocytosis (50 K/UL; normal range: 4.8-10.8 K/UL). The patient was then admitted to the ICU. He tested positive for pneumococcal antigen and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The patient was found to be clinically improving on broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy. He was downgraded to the medical floors on oral antibiotics and nasal cannula 2 LPM saturating 95%. Two days later, the patient started desaturating again and spiking fevers of 100.5 °F. He was then started on remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia based on the data available at that time. The patient drastically deteriorated and was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Unfortunately, he went into cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia, and a code blue was called. Advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) was performed; however, we were unable to achieve the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).DiscussionThe SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, started as a cluster in China and has turned into a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 patients usually present with fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath. However, asymptomatic infections have been described as well, though their frequency is still unknown. On the other hand, symptomatic infections can range from mild with minimal or no pneumonia to severe, characterized by 50% lung involvement on imaging, to even critical disease with multiorgan involvement [1].DiscussionBacterial infections have been well described in the context of viral respiratory infections, including influenza, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The bacterial infection is divided into coinfections that occurs in the initial phase of a viral infection or secondary bacterial infection during the recovery phase [2]. Secondary bacterial infections have been reported as a common complication with COVID-19 infection. In a meta-analysis by Langford et al., bacterial coinfection was reported in 3.5% of patients and secondary infection in 14.3% of patients with COVID-19 [3]. Secondary bacterial infections are also common in mechanically ventilated patients and usually present as similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia.DiscussionDiagnosing secondary bacterial infections and coinfections can be challenging. In patients with concomitant viral infections, specifically in COVID-19 patients, deterioration of the respiratory status of the patient can be a sign of the progression of the COVID-19 or secondary bacterial infection. Additional findings that increase the likelihood of bacterial infection and indicate empiric antibiotic therapy prior to getting culture results include new leukocytosis, particularly neutrophilic leukocytosis, new fever, and worsening respiratory failure [4].DiscussionStreptococcus pneumonia has traditionally been the most common cause of CAP. However, the frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia has been decreasing as a result of the use of pneumococcal vaccines and herd immunity [5]. Risk factors for pneumococcal pneumonia include cigarette smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and viral infections. CAP is usually diagnosed based on patient history and X-ray findings. It is usually treated empirically. However, isolation of the causative agent can help direct antibiotic therapy. Streptococcus pneumonia can be identified in sputum or blood culture; detection of pneumococcal antigen in the urine is more sensitive. Procalcitonin has not been found to be helpful in pneumococcal pneumonia [6]. Chest X-ray typically shows lobar infiltrate, which is different from the typical COVID-19 findings of bilateral, peripheral, and lower-zone-predominant air-space disease.DiscussionTreatment of pneumococcal pneumonia is by antibiotics. An early diagnosis of coinfection is required. Future studies on concomitant bacterial infection in COVID-19 are needed, especially focusing on the temporal relationship of bacterial infection relative to the patient presented as well as accurate diagnosis. Our patient likely had coinfection of pneumococcal pneumonia along with early COVID-19 infection. Although he was treated for pneumococcal pneumonia, his COVID-19 progressed, leading to respiratory failure and death.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 200,000 deaths in the United States. Understanding whether a patient is infected solely by the virus or if there is a superimposed bacterial infection as well is crucial to the management of these patients. This study discussed the case of an unfortunate patient who was treated appropriately for pneumococcal pneumonia and COVID-19; however, his respiratory status deteriorated during the hospital course. We urge our fellow researchers to conduct prospective cohort studies with regard to the optimal treatment of concomitant novel coronavirus and superimposed bacterial infection."
Surgical mask use by healthcare personnel to prevent COVID‐19 spread in a long‐term care facility,"Long‐term care facilities are frequently recognized as high‐risk settings for severe outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak. Most residents are elderly or have baseline diseases, and it is difficult for some cognitively impaired residents to comply with physical distancing. Furthermore, frequent close contact occurs between residents and healthcare personnel (HCP).The universal use of a surgical mask has been a widely adopted practice for infection prevention during epidemics of respiratory viruses in Asian countries, including Japan.Surgical masks have also been recommended for use in Europe and the United States during the COVID‐19 outbreak because of its possible effect in preventing transmission to asymptomatic or from presymptomatic persons. However, it remains unclear whether mask use among HCP could prevent transmission to residents in long‐term care facilities. Here, we report a COVID outbreak in such a facility in Japan, where all HCP were required to wear a surgical mask, including a nurse who identified as the index patient.Description of the COVID‐19 outbreak and its control at the long‐term care facility ::: METHODSThe long‐term care facility is situated in Tsukuba, Japan. Nurses and caregivers routinely checked vital signs and physical condition of the residents twice daily. Both noncontact (temporal) and contact thermometers were used, which were disinfected after every application. Additionally, hand hygiene and the wearing of masks and cloth aprons were routinely practiced by all HCP before the COVID‐19 outbreak. Disposable gloves were worn as needed. The facility had restricted visitors from November 1, 2019, in response to an influenza epidemic; however, a few visitors were allowed to meet with a resident in a private meeting room. Following the COVID‐19 outbreak, the facility completely banned visitation and mandated the wearing of surgical masks for both HCP and residents on February 24, 2020.Index patient and COVID‐19 surveillance ::: METHOD SA nurse at the care facility complained of fever and upper respiratory symptoms after a night shift on March 26. Subsequently, all daytime rehabilitation services were restricted and communal activities were canceled. The index case was identified by surveyors associated with the local healthcare center. As the index case was confirmed to be COVID‐19 positive by RT‐PCR testing, the local health center and an affiliate hospital immediately initiated case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of persons with suspected COVID‐19, and on‐site enhancement of infection prevention and control measures on March 29. Further, all HCP entering the rooms of symptomatic residents were required to wear eye protection, a gown, gloves, and an N95 mask. The index case was immediately admitted to an infectious disease‐designated hospital despite mild symptoms.Index patient and COVID‐19 surveillance. METHODS COVID‐19 surveillance among all residents and HCP by RT‐PCR testing was initiated on March 30. All symptomatic patients and HCP in close contact with the index case were tested first because of the limited availability of RT‐PCR tests. While these tests were completed by April 1, testing of the remaining asymptomatic residents was completed by April 2 and that of the remaining HCP was completed by April 6. RESULTS The index case was a nurse. She had visited Tokyo that was considered as a major outbreak area in Japan before her symptoms occurred. She wore a standard surgical mask and using standard precautions and checked vital signs and provided care for residents during the night shift on March 26, 2020. After finishing her shift, the nurse developed a fever and upper respiratory symptoms and discontinued work. The nurse was diagnosed with COVID‐19 on March 29, following which extensive screening using RT‐PCR tests and contact tracing was performed, and the facility was isolated. All HCP were not considered as being in “close contact” with the index case because they used surgical masks and adhered to standard precautions.RESULTSThere were a total of 17 confirmed cases of COVID‐19:14/93 (15.1%) residents, 3/69 (4.3%) HCP, and 0/22 (0.0%) visitors. The clinical characteristics of residents are presented in Table 1. All residents in the facility had do not attempt resuscitation status regardless of COVID‐19 infection. All patients with COVID‐19 were isolated from the facility to nearby hospitals. As of June 24, no further cases of infection were reported, and among the infected residents, 4/14 (28.6%) had died due to COVID‐19, 9/14 (64.3%) returned to the facility, and 1/14 (7.1%) remain hospitalized. Among them, two residents had died after RT‐PCR was negative. All HCP with COVID‐19 infection have returned to work. Among those residents without confirmed COVID‐19 infection, 3/79 (3.8%) died from unrelated causes during the observation period.DISCUSSIONThe index case was a nurse who routinely used a surgical mask, and the secondary spread ratio from the index case to facility residents was determined to be approximately 15%. This ratio is comparable to that reported by other studies that have investigated the effects of surgical mask utilization in healthcare workers, families,and animals.A meta‐analysis to investigate the effects of face masks showed similar results to our study.Although mask use by all HCP as source control is considered to prevent transmission from a mildly symptomatic HCP (not considered as being in “close contact”),The wearing of a surgical mask by HCP might have had limited effects in preventing COVID‐19 transmission at the long‐term care facility in our study.DISCUSSIONThere are some study limitations. First, it was unclear if the index case and HCP appropriately used a surgical mask. Second, residents probably did not adhere to infection control measures, such as wearing a mask, because of dementia. Third, other infection control measures such as hand hygiene and social distancing might have had greater protective effects even though they were less modifiable in a long‐term care facility.CONCLUSIONSMask utilization by HCP was not much effective in preventing COVID‐19 transmission, even when interaction was not considered as being in close contact.CONFLICT OF INTERESTSThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSTA, YT, AK, and HI conceived and designed the study.

Zero COVID‐19 infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients: Findings from population‐based inflammatory bowel disease registries in Hong Kong and Taiwan,"The novel coronavirus infection (COVID‐19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV)‐2 virus have affected more than 8 million people worldwide. Elderly subjects and those with chronic underlying conditions have more severe disease and higher mortality with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.Patients with immune‐mediated diseases are at increased risk of viral infections. Through April 30, 877 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID‐19 were included in the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE)‐IBD worldwide registry (https://covidibd.org/) based on voluntary physician reporting. Self‐reported registries may be associated with under‐reporting, and in North America and Europe, individuals with suspected COVID‐19 symptoms are advised to self‐isolate without testing. In the early phase of outbreak, single‐center studies in Wuhan and Northern Italy have reported that none of their IBD patients had COVID‐19 infection.A multicenter study in Spain reported that 40 IBD patients were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, but none required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. Hong Kong and Taiwan were amongst the first two regions in the world to be affected by COVID‐19 since the initial outbreak in Wuhan. Three months into the pandemic, we utilized population‐based registries in Hong Kong and Taiwan to determine the risk of COVID‐19 infection amongst IBD patients.MethodsIn Hong Kong, patients with IBD were identified from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), an electronic health‐care database covering patient's demographics, diagnoses, procedures, drug prescription, laboratory results, and mortality from all public hospitals and clinics under the management of Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. Hospital Authority is the sole public health‐care provider in Hong Kong, serving 7.5 million population. We further confirmed findings from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System with information from the Nixon‐TAM Hong Kong IBD registry, a territory‐wide registry developed in 2013, covering >95% of IBD patients in Hong Kong. In Taiwan, National Health Insurance (NHI) provided by Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan, is a compulsory program with coverage of 99.7% of 2.3 billion population in Taiwan, and data were updated until 2015. From 2000 to 2015, there were 3806 IBD registered as catastrophic illness. Since there is a 3‐year gap for NHI data availability, lack of disease phenotype and severity recording, Taiwan Society of IBD set up a web‐based registration, which included one retrospective registration since 2015 and prospective registration since 2017. So far, registered cases covered >80% of those registered in NHI database. The diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was confirmed by positive RT‐PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs.ResultsA total of 2954 (59.7% male, mean age: 53.36 ± 16.12 years, 62.3% ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 2,554 (63.1% male, mean age: 44.95 ± 16.34 years, 65.9% UC) IBD patients were identified in Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that 65.3%, 39.1%, 4.3%, and 12.8% IBD patients in Hong Kong and 75.8%, 51.4%, 26.1%, and 52.3% in Taiwan were on treatment with 5‐aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and biologics, respectively. (Table 1). As of April 15, 2020, 75 210 and 60 956 COVID‐19 tests were performed, and 1017 and 429 subjects, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. None of these subjects had IBD. In Hong Kong, 40 IBD patients were tested for COVID‐19 due to suspected symptoms, contact with suspected cases and travel history, and none were detected positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. Twenty‐eight (70%) were symptomatic, and one had a travel history to mainland China. Thirty (75%) were on 5‐aminosalicylates acid, 15 (37.5%) on immunosuppressants (14 thiopurine and 1 tacrolimus), 11 (27.5%) on corticosteroids, and 7 (17.5%) on biologics (3 infliximab, 1 adalimumab, 2 vedolizumab, and 1 ustekinumab). One IBD patient on ustekinumab in Taiwan was a close contact with confirmed COVID‐19 case and tested negative for COVID‐19.DiscussionThree months into the first cases of laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 in Hong Kong and Taiwan in January 21 and 22, respectively, we reported zero‐infection rate with COVID‐19 amongst IBD patients. Hong Kong and Taiwan have one of the lowest numbers of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected people, and mortality rates (0.39% Hong Kong; 1.40% Taiwan) remain extremely low. These two regions have effectively reduced COVID‐19 transmission, measured by the average number of people each infected individual infects, through swift surveillance, active contact tracing, quarantine for returning residents, and social distancing including universal face masks and school closures. Transmissibility of COVID‐19 (Rt) remained at approximately 1 in Hong Kong. So far, there is no evidence that IBD patients are at increased risk of COVID‐19 unless they also have other comorbidities including increased age, cardiovascular diseases, or diabetes mellitus. Data from SECURE‐IBD Registry showed an overall 4% mortality rate amongst IBD patients with COVID‐19. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, patients with stable IBD are recommended to continue their treatment, which is consistent with recommendations from the International Organization of IBD. Up to 6% adult and 22% pediatric IBD patients who delayed immunosuppressants or biologic treatment had experienced disease flare. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID‐19 outcomes, and it has been suggested that anti‐TNF could potentially be protective against COVID‐19 although further data are required. The pro‐inflammatory cytokine, TNF‐α, was found to be increased in various pulmonary inflammatory conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Data from the SECURE‐IBD registry showed that corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio 6.9; 95% confidence interval 2.3–20.5), but not anti‐TNF (adjusted odds ratio 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.4–2.2), were associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID‐19 infection.Corticosteroids have been consistently shown to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 in both IBD and rheumatology patients. There was a high rate of steroids usage in the Taiwan cohort (55.6% for the retrospective cohort and 26.1% in the prospective cohort); it is thus recommended that physicians should wean off steroids in a timely manner and avoid unnecessary use of steroids unless there are no other alternatives.DiscussionTo our knowledge, these are the first and only population‐based cohorts to report COVID‐19 incidence in IBD. Besides, both Hong Kong and Taiwan governments recommend COVID‐19 testing in symptomatic subjects and those returning from overseas or had close contacts with confirmed COVID‐19 cases. Our rates are applicable to the symptomatic population. Currently, only 1% and 0.3% of population in Hong Kong and Taiwan had received COVID‐19 testing, so asymptomatic cases might be missed, but we believe these numbers are small. To detect the true prevalence of COVID‐19 amongst IBD and/or the general population, Hong Kong is currently offering serology test for viral antibody as a pilot trial and such data will allow us to identify the “silent” positive subjects.DiscussionNonetheless, both regions need to be prepared for the second wave of the COVID‐19 outbreak. In fact, there has been resurge of COVID‐19 cases in certain parts of Asia, like Beijing and Seoul since early June 2020. Continuation of mask policy and maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene should still be enforced. Ensuring adequate supply of surgical masks and personal protective equipment is essential in order to prepare for the possible second wave of COVID‐19. Effective contact tracing strategy should be implemented once there is a sign of resurgence of COVID‐19.DiscussionIn conclusion, our population‐based data revealed that there were no IBD patients who developed COVID‐19 infection during the study period. We should continue to stay alert and be prepared for the possible second wave of COVID‐19 infection.

"Cancer care disruption and reorganisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: A patient, carer and healthcare worker perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically and precipitously altered the cancer care landscape. Disruptions have been seen across all facets of cancer care, from delaying diagnoses and treatment to halting clinical trials, and diminishing access to psychosocial support [1–6]. The resilience of healthcare systems to withstand significant operational pressures whilst maintaining high quality cancer care continues to be tested.IntroductionAustralia’s pandemic response has largely been effective by international comparisons [7]. With a population of around 25 million, Australia has experienced lower infection and death rates than many comparable countries, with 28,978 confirmed cases and 909 deaths as of March 1st, 2021 [8]. While the Australian health system has not been adversely affected to the same extent as many other countries in Europe and North America, the pandemic necessitated extensive preparations and widespread changes to routine healthcare.IntroductionPeople with cancer may have increased vulnerability to COVID-19 due to their need for regular access to–oftentimes intensive and immune-suppressing–treatment and care [9]. In response, cancer treatments were modified according to rapidly published guidelines, and hospital visitation restrictions were applied [1, 3, 5, 10]. Although cancer-related services were classified as vital and remained available (albeit with modifications), utilisation declined [11, 12], with cancer screening programs temporarily paused by Australian health authorities (e.g., BreastScreen) or experiencing disruption (e.g., National Cervical Screening Program) [1]. The potential effects of reduced access to and under-utilisation of cancer-related health services are substantial. Prolonged delays in diagnoses and treatment can lead to a more advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis, poorer health outcomes, and subsequent downstream health system effects (such as greater costs to health systems and surges in diagnostic and treatment demand) [13, 14].IntroductionThe pandemic and associated public health measures have also had profound impacts on the lives of people diagnosed with cancer and their support networks [6]. People with cancer and their families already experience great uncertainty about their future, which may be further exacerbated by concerns about contracting the virus, disruptions to their care, and the effects of social isolation [6]. While the long-term effects of pandemic response measures and subsequent care disruptions on the prognosis of people with cancer is not yet known, the psychosocial impact on patients, families, and carers is increasingly evident [2, 15].IntroductionFurther, through a confluence of factors including physical distancing measures, patients’ reluctance to visit healthcare centres, and efforts to reduce demand on acute care service, new models of healthcare delivery in the form of telehealth and video consults have emerged [5, 12]. Healthcare providers have been encouraged to offer virtual care throughout the pandemic, with the Australian Government introducing a series of new Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers–a list of Government subsidised services–for telehealth consults throughout 2020 [11]. Whilst telehealth had previously been adopted in some settings, including rural and remote communities [16] and specialist care [17], COVID-19 prompted a rapid scale-up (of predominantly telephone-based telehealth) in less established settings, including general practice, allied health and hospital outpatient clinics [11]. Such rapid acceleration of this digital transition is unprecedented, with limited time for preparations or extensive piloting with healthcare professionals, patients and their carers.IntroductionThe aims of this study are to describe the ways in which cancer care in Australia has been disrupted and reorganised during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to understand the impact this has had from the perspectives of both people affected by cancer and healthcare workers.Participants and design ::: MethodsTwo concurrent cross-sectional surveys were conducted online to assess the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care delivery in Australia with: a) people affected by cancer, including cancer patients, cancer survivors, carers, family members or friends and b) healthcare workers. People affected by cancer were eligible to participate if they resided in Australia, were aged 18 or above, and had a current or previous diagnosis of cancer, or were a caregiver, family member or friend of someone diagnosed with cancer. Respondents were asked tailored survey questions depending on their relationship with the person affected by cancer (e.g., caregiving frequency, attendance at appointments). Healthcare workers were eligible to participate if they were employed or involved in the delivery of cancer services in Australia.Participants and design ::: MethodsThe surveys were advertised on the Cancer Council NSW and Cancer Council Australia websites and were promoted via social media (Facebook and Twitter). Invitations were also distributed through existing cancer community and healthcare professional networks across Australia (e.g., Cancer Voices and Clinical Oncology Society of Australia). All survey responses were collected between 22 June and 30 September 2020. During this time, Australia was under nation-wide COVID-19 restrictions and both international and inter-state travel bans were in place. The study period also corresponded with the COVID-19 cluster which emerged in Melbourne, Victoria in late June 2020, resulting in more than 110 days of lockdown restrictions. Under these restrictions, Melbournians and other Victorian residents were ordered to stay at home unless they needed to leave for medical reasons, essential shopping, essential work, or outdoor exercise (within geographical limits). Upon closure of the survey on 30 September 2020, Australia had recorded 27,000 COVID-19 infections and 886 deaths [18].Participants and design ::: MethodsEthical approval was granted for this research by Cancer Council NSW’s Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) (Ref: #322). For both the surveys, participants were directed to an online version of the Participant Information Statement and specifically asked for their consent before beginning the survey.Measures ::: MethodsDemographic data and other descriptive information were collected for all participants. For those affected by cancer, data were collected on year of diagnosis, cancer stage, cancer type and current treatment. For healthcare workers, data were collected on the type of profession, length in role, primary work setting, and whether their role involved direct clinical interactions with patients.Measures ::: MethodsBoth surveys comprised of sections regarding changes to cancer care delivery and experiences of telehealth. The measures used in the surveys were based on available pre-existing evidence around the impact of COVID-19, adapted versions of relevant validated tools, and stakeholder (i.e., clinician, consumer) consultation. For the measures used in the survey for those affected by cancer, questions were informed by an in-depth qualitative analysis of a National Cancer Information and Support Line and Online Cancer Community Forum in Australia (https://www.cancer.org.au/online-resources/cancer-council-online-community) [19]. Additionally, some measures regarding cancer care quality and telehealth described in this paper were adapted from The Cancer Care Coordination Questionnaire for Patients [20] and The Telehealth Satisfaction Scale [21]. The healthcare worker survey included a specific section focused on cancer care delivery and reorganisation which is the focus of this analysis. The development of measures in this section of the survey were informed by emerging evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19, the literature on previous crisis events (e.g., the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic), and healthcare performance. Four key categories focussed on exploring quality of care [22], organisational support [e.g., 23], resources [24], time and priorities [25], in consideration of the crisis. In both surveys, our definition of telehealth included both telephone and online consults.Measures ::: MethodsThe study surveys were tested by our consumer representative and by reviewers experienced in cancer care to assure quality while piloting was not done due to the time critical nature of the survey. Data quality was checked at regular intervals post survey release.Data analysis ::: MethodsDemographic data and quantitative survey responses were examined using frequency and percentages for categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Qualitative survey responses were imported into NVivo 12 Plus software (QSR International Pty Ltd 2018) to separately undergo an inductive thematic qualitative content analysis. Using this approach, a preliminary review of the content was performed by GT to develop the initial coding structure which was then shared with the research team (RE, JM and NT) for secondary review and comment. This informed the refinement of the coding framework which was then applied to the complete dataset. Similar codes were grouped together into higher order categories and subthemes, identified by salience and frequency [26]. In the results, alignments between quantitative survey findings and the emergent themes from the qualitative analysis were identified and reported.Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsDuring the pandemic, a range of disruptions to routine cancer care services were reported by both those affected by cancer and healthcare workers. Overall, 42% of cancer patients and survivors reported experiencing some level of disruption to their cancer care or treatment. Of this cohort, 44% (n = 118) were receiving active treatment (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or surgery). 49% of carers suggested there had been care disruptions for the person whom they cared for. More specifically, almost a third of cancer patients and survivors (28%) indicated that their medical appointments had needed to be rescheduled, 10% reported that their cancer treatment had been postponed, 7% reported elective surgeries had been delayed, and 12% suggested their planned cancer screening tests had been rescheduled (Fig 1).Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsCancer patients and survivors described feelings of stress and anxiety associated with these rapidly unfolding changes, and highlighted communication issues with their healthcare provider in some instances:Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsAlthough reported cancellations were relatively low (suggested by 10% of respondents overall), there were still instances where appointments, surgeries, clinical trials and hospital support groups or programs had been cancelled due to the reorganisation of cancer care in response to the pandemic.Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsPatients and carers also articulated frustrations about the perceived prioritisation of COVID-19 over their cancer-related symptoms and reported that this caused distress. Some patients also described their hesitancy to attend future appointments at healthcare centres due to their fears of potential COVID-19 exposure.Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsDisruptions to cancer services were also reported by healthcare workers, with 43% agreeing that there had been atypical delays in delivering cancer care, and half (50%) agreeing that patient access to research and clinical trials had been reduced since the onset of the pandemic. In associated comments, they provided details about delays to essential cancer diagnostic procedures and treatments:Experiences of cancer service and care disruptions ::: ResultsFurther, consistent with the hesitancy reported by some cancer patients and survivors in attending healthcare centres, 45% of healthcare workers agreed that the number of consultations cancelled by patients had increased from prior to the pandemic. They expressed concern about the potential long-term impacts of reduced appointment attendance and delays to treatment and diagnostics on long-term cancer prognosis:Perceived quality of clinical care during the pandemic ::: ResultsDespite the disruptions observed across cancer services during the study period, 61% of cancer patients, survivors and carers agreed that they felt fully informed about changes to cancer treatment plans. Further, the majority reported that they did not encounter difficulties obtaining appointments with their regular healthcare provider, nor experience longer wait times for appointments (Fig 2). This sentiment was also echoed in some of the comments they provided in the survey:Perceived quality of clinical care during the pandemic ::: ResultsHowever, whilst the majority responded positively, there were also some concerns flagged by patients and carers about care quality. In some instances, they described a lack of information provided by the health system about service disruptions, particularly in the earlier weeks of the pandemic. Further, some explained how their cancer treatment plans had essentially “disappeared” and that they were experiencing challenges in accessing usual care.Perceived quality of clinical care during the pandemic ::: ResultsFor healthcare workers, similar ambiguities to patients and carers were identified in their perceptions of care quality during COVID-19. As demonstrated in Fig 3, 72% reported being happy with the quality of care they had been able to provide to cancer patients during this crisis, however, almost a third (31%) suggested that changes to cancer diagnostic procedures and/or pathways had made them suboptimal. Healthcare workers highlighted the additional challenges of maintaining quality of care and meeting patients’ needs during the pandemic, with 73% agreeing that the complexity of care had increased and 85% agreeing (50% strongly agreeing) that COVID-19 had increased pressure on their patients’ mental health and wellbeing.Experiences of telehealth during the pandemic ::: ResultsPrior to the pandemic, only 17% of cancer patients, survivors and carers reported that they had used telehealth services for their cancer care, compared to nearly three quarters (73%) after the onset of COVID-19.Experiences of telehealth during the pandemic ::: ResultsCancer patients and survivors indicated that most of these telehealth consults during the pandemic had been with their GP (65%) or a specialist consultant (64%) (e.g., medical oncologist). A smaller proportion had received psychological support or had an appointment with an allied health professional over telehealth. For healthcare workers, 60% reported that more than half of their regular appointments had been moved to telehealth consultations since the onset of the pandemic, with the majority (68%) agreeing they had received adequate support to adopt these alternative modes of service delivery.Experiences of telehealth during the pandemic ::: ResultsOverall, general patient satisfaction with telehealth consults for their cancer care was high, with 80% rating the accessibility and convenience of the appointment and quality of care they received as either ‘good’ or ‘excellent’. Respect of privacy and the process of logging/dialling into the appointment were also highly rated. However, when asked about the psychological and emotional support they had received over telehealth, 18% reported their experience had been ‘poor’ or ‘fair’ (Fig 4).Experiences of telehealth during the pandemic ::: ResultsThe main perceived benefits of telehealth for cancer patients and survivors included the reduced exposure risk to COVID-19, reduced costs of attending treatment (i.e., travel, parking, childcare) and more timely access to services. In contrast, the most frequently cited difficulties were concerns about whether telehealth would deliver the same quality of care as a physical examination, with 18% of respondents suggesting this was of concern for them. Cancer patients, survivors and carers described a lack of personalised care (e.g., reduced rapport and interpersonal connection) and difficulties interpreting information they had been provided through online or telephone consults. They also highlighted how telehealth was not always optimal for certain types of appointments, particularly when physical examinations were required, or psychological support was being delivered. When cancer patients and survivors were asked about their likelihood of using telehealth services in future, more than half (55%) indicated that they would use this again, however, 1 in 5 (20%) answered that they were unlikely to.Experiences of telehealth during the pandemic ::: ResultsHealthcare workers also articulated benefits of telehealth such as decreased wait times, streamlined processes and increased privacy. However, they too raised concerns about the appropriateness of telehealth consultations where physical assessments were required, or interpersonal connection was important for the delivery of optimal care. Healthcare workers also described the challenges they had experienced with making accurate diagnoses over telehealth and highlighted how non-verbal communication and body language cues that may signify psychological distress were easier to miss. The positive and negative perceptions of both healthcare workers and patients or carers in relation to telehealth are shown in Table 2.Impacts of the pandemic on the supporting role of carers and family members in cancer care ::: ResultsOver three quarters (79%) of healthcare workers reported that involving carers in consults had become more challenging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. They explained how the restrictions on hospital visitation had been difficult to communicate to patients and their families, and that the reduction in essential support was likely having a negative impact on their mental health and wellbeing.Impacts of the pandemic on the supporting role of carers and family members in cancer care ::: ResultsPatients and their carers similarly described the challenges they faced attending in-person consults together as a result of restricted hospital visitation and social distancing measures. Further, almost half (48%) of carers reported that they had been unable to attend telehealth consults with the person diagnosed by cancer. They described how not being able to attend appointments–whether in-person or via telehealth–had placed an additional burden on them to provide the same levels of practical and emotional support as before the pandemic. Some carers suggested that they were no longer able to listen to and clarify important information for their loved ones, nor understand how they were best able to provide support during intensive treatments. Patients also highlighted the lonely experience of attending appointments with a reduced social support network. They felt overwhelmed attending cancer treatments alone, and described challenges with digesting and interpreting health information from clinicians without this additional support.Limitations ::: DiscussionWe acknowledge that our study has limitations. Our sample of participants recruited using national websites, existing cancer community networks and social media channels may have resulted in a convenience sample that was not representative of the wider population of those affected by cancer. We also acknowledge that certain demographic groups were overrepresented in our sample (e.g., NSW respondents, women, and people with early stage and localized cancers, and in recovery and remission). Additionally, given that only a small proportion of respondents affected by cancer were from Victoria (<10%), the state most affected by COVID-19 restrictions during the study period, our findings may underrepresent the true impacts of the pandemic on cancer care nationally.Limitations ::: DiscussionOur study found reports of notable disruptions to cancer care, yet we could not determine the clinical appropriateness of such changes, nor the extent to which these reports corroborate objectively measured service disruption, or whether these were likely to affect morbidity and mortality. Despite these limitations, we believe that this research provides a timely and valuable contribution to the emerging evidence of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care, with a unique approach of exploring the experiences and perceptions of both the care recipients and care providers concurrently. The relevant timing of our two surveys and the large sample size of people affected by cancer also increases the relevance and applicability of our study. As the pandemic evolves over time, further research is required to understand the changing experiences of people affected by cancer and healthcare workers in response to the pandemic-related policy and practice changes and as COVID-19 vaccine uptake increases.ConclusionThe exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic have altered cancer care. Although Australia has been largely successful in curbing the spread of the virus to date, the pandemic has exacerbated what is already an immensely stressful and uncertain time for people affected by cancer. The long-term effects remain to be seen [6]. The reorganisation of cancer care and the adoption of telehealth has been essential, and the value of these adaptations for the pandemic response, preparedness, and beyond, is clear. However, our findings highlight the need for efforts to better integrate psychosocial support and the important role of carers into evolving pandemic response measures to guide health systems towards an equitable and person-centred digital future. Although the COVID-19 response is ongoing and contexts are constantly evolving, how we respond is ultimately dependent on how well we efficiently translate lessons learned into effective policy and practice."
Cannabis Use among Patients with Alopecia Areata: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune condition of hair loss that significantly impacts patients' quality of life.[12] At present, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for AA and patients often report dissatisfaction with current medical treatments.[3] AA has been associated with significant psychosocial burden and patients often seek alternative treatment methods such as mental health services and support groups.[34]INTRODUCTIONCannabis has been proposed as an alternative treatment to manage both emotional and physical symptoms in various conditions.[56] Cannabis use is becoming increasingly popular with the expansion of legalization, making it more accessible for use by the general population.[7] While cannabis has shown potential among other dermatological conditions,[5] no literature has described cannabis use among patients with AA. This study aims to characterize cannabis use among patients with AA through a web-based survey.Cannabis use among patients with alopecia areata ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSCannabis use was defined as use of any of the following: (1) Smoking marijuana or cannabidiol (CBD) (2) ingesting marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or CBD (3) inhaling vaporized liquid THC, hash oil, or CBD, and (4) CBD lotions and creams.[8] The definition of “current” cannabis use was adapted from the CDC, defined as use within the last 30 days.[9] Participants with a history of use but no use within the last 30 days were categorized as “former” cannabis users.Impact of cannabis on symptoms ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSWe assessed the impact of cannabis use on various physical and psychosocial domains associated with AA, based off the AA Symptom Impact Scale, a validated questionnaire that evaluates AA symptom severity.[10] The study collected demographic data and clinical characteristics of AA [Supplement 1].Statistical analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSContinuous variables were summarized using averages. Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages, and Chi-square tests were used to test their associations. All analyses were performed with JASP version 0.14.1 (JASP, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). and P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.Cannabis use among patients with alopecia areata ::: RESULTS65.9% (n = 689) of participants reported ever using cannabis. Among these patients, 51.8% (n = 357) were current users. Most current cannabis users used daily/almost daily (n = 170, 47.6%) [Table 2]. 40.3% (n = 144) of patients reported that they had started using cannabis after their diagnosis of AA [Table 2].Cannabis use among patients with alopecia areata ::: RESULTSThe most common reasons for cannabis use among current users was for AA-related symptoms (n = 199, 55.7%) or for recreation (n = 197, 55.2%) [Table 2]. Only 5.6% (n = 11) of patients using cannabis for AA-related symptoms reported being encouraged to try cannabis by a healthcare professional, and of these, only one received a prescription for medical cannabis [Supplement 3]. The most common reason for stopping cannabis use was “other,” such as pregnancy or medical contraindications [Supplement 4].Impact of cannabis use on symptoms related to alopecia areata ::: RESULTSCannabis was most frequently perceived to improve symptoms of stress (n = 261, 73.1%) and anxiety/sadness/depression (n = 234, 65.6%). Most participants indicated that cannabis had no impact on hair loss (n = 287, 80.4%) or discomfort of the skin (n = 135, 37.8%). Symptoms of loss of interest in hobbies and social and sexual relationships were also generally not impacted by cannabis use [Figure 1 and Supplement 5].Limitations ::: DISCUSSIONThis study has several limitations. This study was administered during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate symptoms such as feelings of isolation and anxiety. Our survey was distributed using large, overlapping listservs, and therefore we were unable to determine an exact response rate. Patients in the NAAF database may not be representative of all patients with AA.Financial support and sponsorship.Conflicts of interest"
A case of trigeminal neuralgia developing after a COVID-19 vaccination,"COVID-19 is a viral disease, causing serious morbidity and mortality. To prevent the disease, a variety of vaccines have developed and been administered to people all over the world. Though they have a high level of efficacy and safety across all populations, many different side effects have been shown (Polack et al. 2020; Jackson et al. 2020). Previously, neurological involvements have been reported after vaccinations (Fenichel 1982). In COVID-19 vaccinations, although neurological complications including bell’s palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and multiple sclerosis have been observed, the incidence is not well known (Wan et al. 2021; Havla et al. 2021; Khayat-Khoei et al. 2021). Herein, we report a patient with trigeminal neuritis following the vaccination, incidentally treated with steroid.Case reportA 45-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with 3 days of facial and jaw pain, and fatigue. Sometimes, it was accompanied by a toothache. Three days ago, she received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and the complaints developed following the vaccination. She was in good general condition and fully cooperative. In the medical history, the patient had no chronic diseases and did not experience any serious side effects after childhood vaccinations. Additionally, other physical examinations were normal and the laboratory values were unremarkable. The features of the pain were unilateral, acute onset, and severe. It was of short duration and localized to the right of the face. Initially, they were attributed to the general side effects of the vaccination; a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was administered. On the treatment, she continued to experience attacks of pain and noticed it was triggering with brushing her teeth and putting on makeup. Also, she felt the pain in the lower part of her face and stated that it arose from a focus. At the end of a month, she still had attacks of pain which significantly reduced the quality of life of the patient. In addition, the patient refused to receive the second shot because of the ongoing complaints. Due to the findings including typical features and localization of the pain and triggering by some actions, the case was considered as trigeminal neuralgia (TN 2021). Pregabalin was administered to control the pain. However, despite 4 weeks of the treatment, the pain persisted, and her attacks continued. Concurrently, the patient was consulted for toothache. Though the dental X-ray was normal, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (daily 2 × 1 g) was given. Following the use of the first dose antibiotic, angioedema developed, and her general condition worsened. In the emergency room, 80 mg Methylprednisolon intravenously was administered. Later, the patient was discharged to home with a 7-day tapering course of steroids. With this treatment, all complaints including facial, and jaw and tooth pain were recovered. The patient has been doing well and has no recurrence on regular follow-ups for 6 months.DiscussionTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare disease which affects women more than men. The incidence is estimated to be 4 to 13 cases per 1,000,000 and gradually increases with age. Its pain typically involves the lower face and jaw. Generally, it is limited to one side of the face and can be triggered by a routine action such as brushing your teeth, eating, or the wind (www. uptodate.com). It is characterized by clinically intense, sharp, and superficial pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS) The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition 2018). Although the clinical presentation of TN can differ among patients, its diagnosis is mainly based on description of the facial pain. Also, TN may sometimes be confused with dental causes of pain requiring dental examination (www. uptodate.com). In this case, she has typical clinical manifestations of TN and incidentally treated with glucocorticosteroid.DiscussionIn the literature, Narasimhalu et al. reported the first case of TN with cervical radiculitis following COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNtech) (Narasimhalu et al. 2021). The patient presented with swelling and pain over the left face and neck and MRI of trigeminal nerve revealed an abnormal asymmetric thickening. In this report, initially pregabalin was administered but the pain persisted. Finally, she was treated with a tapering course of oral prednisolone. Considering the clinical features and treatment strategy, the reported case is similar to our patient who is the second one in the literature. In addition, Molina-Gil et al. reported a case of COVID-19 infection presenting with TN (Molina‐Gil et al. 2021).DiscussionAfter COVID-19 vaccinations, though neurological involvements are described, the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated and has been attributed to molecular mimicry and immune-mediated inflammatory response (Doser et al. 2002)(Narasimhalu et al. 2021). While the former often requires at least 10–14 days to develop, the latter needs less time to develop than it. In our case, we think immune-mediated inflammation is a more likely mechanism due to the fairly rapid onset of the symptoms and the response to corticosteroids.DiscussionIn conclusion, neurological complications including TN can be observed in a COVID-19 vaccination. Its pain may fail to respond to traditional treatments and recur. In such cases, corticosteroids should be considered as a choice of therapy. Therefore, we suggest that the efficacy of administration of steroids in this situation should be explored."
SARS Antibody Test for Serosurveillance,"Synthetic Peptide ELISA ::: Materials and MethodsWe developed an ELISA for SARS that has synthetic peptide antigens as the solid-phase immunosorbent. Over 200 overlapping peptides, deduced from the Tor2 SARS-CoV genomic sequence (19), were synthesized as candidate antigens from the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Candidate immunodominant S, M, and N peptides were selected and refined on the basis of serologic reactivities to a panel of serum samples from 13 patients clinically diagnosed with SARS at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei and the Xiaotangshan SARS Emergency Hospital in Beijing (20). Epitope mapping by serologic validation has been described for the development of peptide-based ELISA tests for HIV, hepatitis C virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (21–23). For the peptide-based SARS ELISA, wells of microtiter plates were coated with 2 µg/mL of a mixture of the S, M, and N protein–derived peptides, and serologic reactivities were determined by a standard ELISA procedure as previously described (23), except that the detector was horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-human IgG, and the chromaphore was 3,3´,5,5´-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). In brief, serum samples, including two normal human samples provided as nonreactive controls, were diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline with carrier proteins and preservative. The diluted serum samples were reacted to the peptide-coated microtiter wells for l h at 37°C. Plates were washed 6 times, reacted to the antibody conjugate, again washed 6 times, and reacted to TMB; reactivity was then determined by A450. Assay results were obtained within 3 h. Results were scored on the basis of the signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio, and cutoff absorbance was determined from the mean of the two controls plus 6 standard deviations (SD) from the distribution of normal human samples (Figure 1).Serum Panels ::: Materials and MethodsSeroconversion panels were collected as serial serum samples from SARS patients at National Taiwan University Hospital in the course of treatment. These panels tested positive for seroconversion by IFA (24) and are used here to evaluate analytical sensitivity.Serum Panels ::: Materials and MethodsA panel of 69 serum samples from convalescent SARS patients were provided by the Center for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan, to evaluate diagnostic sensitivity. These serum specimens were confirmed for SARS-CoV infection clinically by the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria (1) and serologically by whole virus–based ELISA and IFA; some specimens were also confirmed by RT-PCR (24). Samples were drawn with appropriate timing for serologic reactivity (7–25 weeks after onset of symptoms). A panel of 1,390 plasma samples collected from random blood donors in Florida before 2001 was obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston, TX) for specificity evaluation.Serum Panels ::: Materials and MethodsAdditional specificity studies were conducted with serum that had serologic reactivities for bloodborne pathogens (HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis C virus, HTLV 1/II, and syphilis) obtained by United Biomedical Inc. before 2000 from various U.S. sources, an interference panel supplied by Boston Biomedica Inc. (Boston, MA) of serum samples with interference substances commonly found in processed clinical samples (EDTA, acid citrate dextrose, and citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine), and serum supplied by National Taiwan University Hospital from patients associated with typical and atypical respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV (influenza, rubella, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Serum samples were collected from healthy healthcare workers after interviews to confirm lack of signs and symptoms of SARS including fever, respiratory symptoms, and diarrhea.Sensitivity ::: ResultsThe peptide-based ELISA was evaluated for sensitivity to seroconversion on eight seroconversion panels obtained from National Taiwan University Hospital (Figure 2, Table 1). In patient 1, seroconversion was detected by day 11 with an A450 of 1.638. Absorbance remained at >2 at day 97. In patient 2, from whom blood was drawn on days 0, 6, 16, 27, and 116 (no samples were collected from day 6 to day 16), seroconversion was apparent on day 16 after the onset of fever. On day 116, the A450 remained >3. In five of the other six seroconversion panels, from acute to convalescent phases, seropositivity was observed by days 8 to 12, and by day 16 in patient 6, from whom serum had not been collected from days 6 to 16 (Figure 2). The peptide-based ELISA showed an analytical sensitivity to earliest time of detection by week 2 and for duration of detection beyond day 100. The seroreactivities of patients 3 to 8 were also evaluated by a standard IFA method (24) for comparison. Seroconversion was detected in all six patients by the IFA method within 2 days of the peptide ELISA (data not shown).Sensitivity ::: ResultsThe diagnostic sensitivity of the peptide ELISA was 100% on a panel of 69 convalescent-phase serum samples from SARS patients provided as a reference panel by the Center for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan. These sera, confirmed for SARS by diagnostic and serologic criteria, displayed a mean S/C ratio of 8.08 (Figure 1).Specificity ::: ResultsThe specificity of the peptide-based SARS ELISA was tested on plasma obtained before 2001 from 1,390 random Florida blood donors (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX). These normal plasma samples with a presumed zero seroprevalence rate gave a mean A450 of 0.074 ± 0.0342 (SD). Subsequently, the cutoff value for the peptide-based assay was set as the mean A450 for duplicate nonreactive controls plus 0.279 (based on 6 SDs from the mean for these 1,390 normal plasma samples). The distribution of the S/C ratio for the blood bank samples is plotted in Figure 1 with the mean S/C ratio of 0.28. None showed positive reactivity, for a specificity on the normal samples of 100% (Table 2).Specificity ::: ResultsThe peptide ELISA was further evaluated for specificity with a pre-2000 collection of serum samples from patients with seropositivities for bloodborne pathogens such as HIV-1, HIV 2, hepatitis C virus, HTLV 1/II, and syphilis (various U.S. sources), and with normal serum samples spiked with interference substances heparin, EDTA, ACD, and CPDA-1 (Boston Biomedica). The 52 samples with seroreactivities for the pathogens all tested negative by the peptide-based SARS ELISA, as did the 41-sera interference panel (Table 2).Specificity ::: ResultsThe peptide ELISA was evaluated for specificity on serum samples drawn from patients associated with typical and atypical respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV (National Taiwan University Hospital). These included samples from 1) 10 patients naturally infected with influenza (two sequential bleeds per influenza patient), 2) 10 patients with rubella, 3) 8 patients with cytomegalovirus infection, 4) 9 patients with Epstein-Barr virus, 5) 5 patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterial agent for atypical pneumonia, and 6) pre- and postvaccine blood samples from 16 patients given influenza vaccine. All samples were tested in duplicate. The site-specific antigens of the peptide SARS-CoV ELISA were free of cross-reactivities to the other respiratory pathogens (Table 2).Serologic Survey of Healthcare Workers ::: ResultsA prospective study was performed to determine asymptomatic infection among primary healthcare workers in hospitals that treated SARS patients. We collected serum samples from 623 healthcare workers without symptoms, not all of whom were in direct contact with SARS patients, who agreed to be tested for antibody to SARS-CoV at Ho Ping, Yang Ming, En Chu Kong, and Hsin Tai Hospitals, approximately 4 weeks after the outbreaks were recognized. Ho Ping and Yang Ming Hospitals had admitted SARS patients before the recognition of SARS and before healthcare workers had implemented control measures. Subsequently, these facilities experienced transmission to healthcare workers. The En Chu Kong and Hsin Tai facilities admitted patients once control measures had been implemented. Neither of these hospitals recorded transmission of SARS to healthcare workers.Serologic Survey of Healthcare Workers ::: ResultsELISA detected three cases out of 383 samples from Ho Ping and one case in 50 blood samples from nursing aides at Yang Ming. These four positive samples, indicative of asymptomatic infection, were confirmed for seropositivity by IFA. None of the 190 serum samples from the two hospitals without nosocomial infection displayed seroconversion.DiscussionA convenient ELISA to detect IgG to SARS-CoV, based on site-specific synthetic antigens taken from the S, M, and N proteins of the virus, has high specificity. No cross-reactivity was detected in samples associated with common non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens. In addition, the lack of detectable reactivities among the 1,390 U.S. blood donors supports a specificity for the assay to distinguish SARS-CoV infection from infection by other human coronaviruses. The presence of anti-coronavirus antibodies among a U.S. population of this size is strongly anticipated because an incidence as high as 8% for OC43 and 229E respiratory infections has been observed, even among healthy young adults (25).DiscussionThe new peptide-based ELISA is equivalent in sensitivity to other immunoassays for SARS and can be detected after day 100. The synthetic antigens provide the advantages of high standardization, freedom from biohazard, and ease of scale-up production. Moreover, testing by the ELISA format can be readily automated for large-scale screening. The highly specific peptide-based SARS antibody test is a convenient means to carry out widespread retrospective surveillance, such as that now being proposed for China to trace hotspots of persons carrying antibodies to SARS-CoV and to track the origins of the disease (26).DiscussionA preliminary survey with the peptide ELISA detected asymptomatic clusters of seroconversion among exposed healthcare workers in two Taiwan hospitals that also had nosocomial disease. In contrast, no seroconversion was found among the exposed healthcare workers from two hospitals that had no apparent disease transmission to healthcare workers. The finding of asymptomatic seropositive persons indicates that the test will be useful in larger retrospective surveillance studies, which are needed to fully define the epidemiology and spectrum of disease."
Influences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Intuitive Exercise and Physical Activity among College Students,"After reviewing the extant literature about its negative impacts on mental and physical behaviors, it was predicted that the pandemic would negatively impact physical activity behaviors among college students. For the relationships between intuitive exercise and attitudes and behaviors during the pandemic, it was hypothesized that higher intuitive exercise scores were associated with greater agreement with exercising more, greater agreement that one’s relationship with exercise was more positive, and less agreement that one had gained weight during the pandemic (Figure 1).2.1. Sample Size Calculation ::: 2. Materials and MethodsTo determine the sample size necessary to reach adequate statistical power (0.80), an a priori power analysis for a paired sample t-test was conducted using G*Power [27]. Results of this analysis revealed that a sample size of 199 participants was sufficient to detect small effects (d = 0.20). Power was also considered for conducting structural equation models. Although there is disagreement amongst scholars, between 100 and 200 participants seems to be the absolute minimum for conducting such analyses [28,29,30,31,32,33].2.2. Participants ::: 2. Materials and MethodsA total of 216 eligible participants at a mid-sized university in the Southeastern region of the United States during the Fall 2020–Spring 2021 academic school year completed an online survey and were therefore enrolled in the study. One hundred and eighty-seven identified as female (87%), 27 identified as male (13%), and two classified their gender as other (0.93%). Age ranged from 18–73 (M = 21.10 years, SD = 4.92 years). A total of 40 first-year students (19%), 45 second-year students (21%), 58 third-year students (27%), 61 fourth-year students (28%), and 12 (6%) graduate students participated in the study.2.3.1. Intuitive Exercise Scale (IEXS) ::: 2.3. Assessments ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe IEXS, a 14-item instrument [23] designed to measure an individual’s relationship with exercise, was used. Characteristics such as enjoyment and diverse movement, mindfulness, and attention to one’s bodily cues were assessed (Appendix A). Participants ranked on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) their perceptions of personal exercise behaviors prior to (“pre”) and during (“during”) the pandemic for items such as “I stop exercising when I am fatigued” and “I use exercise to help soothe my negative emotions”. Scores were calculated using the pre-established scoring guide to create a total score (αpre = 0.59, αduring = 0.63) as well as scores for the subscales: Emotional Exercise, Body Trust, Exercise Rigidity, and Mindful Exercise. Emotional Exercise measures the use of physical activity to control negative emotions (αpre = 0.90, αduring = 0.92). Body Trust (confidence) measures personal reliance on physiological cues for factors such as type, intensity, and frequency of exercise (αpre = 0.84, αduring = 0.88). Exercise Rigidity assesses the variety of exercises in which an individual engages (αpre = 0.89, αduring = 0.92). Mindful Exercise measures recognition of bodily cues to stop exercising (αpre = 0.77, αduring = 0.89). After following scoring guidelines and reverse scoring requirements, higher total subscale scores indicated higher levels of intuitive exercise, which were considered positive in terms of health practices.2.3.2. Open-Ended Questions ::: 2.3. Assessments ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe authors asked additional but open-ended questions concerning attitudes and behaviors towards exercise over the pandemic: “Think back to your behaviors BEFORE the Pandemic. What types of physical activity did you engage in?” “Think back to your behaviors BEFORE the Pandemic. How many days per week did you exercise?” “How have your EXERCISE patterns changed during the pandemic?” and “Anything else you wish to add regarding your food and exercise attitudes and behaviors during the pandemic?” The purpose of these questions was to allow participants to reflect and elaborate on their time spent during quarantine and determine whether and how their health behaviors had changed. A thematic analysis, a form of qualitative/descriptive analysis, was conducted to identify patterns and themes from responses to open-ended questions which allowed participants to provide more in-depth insight into their thoughts and feelings around physical activity [34]. Further, this descriptive analysis was used in exploring explanations for the survey findings [35].2.3.3. Exercise Attitudes and Behaviors during COVID-19 ::: 2.3. Assessments ::: 2. Materials and MethodsParticipants also responded to statements created by the authors to assess exercise-related attitudes and behaviors DURING the pandemic, such as “I believe my relationship with exercise is MORE positive during the pandemic”, “I exercise MORE during the pandemic”, and “I have gained weight since the pandemic”, Participants responded to these statements using a 5-point Likert type scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree). Each statement was analyzed individually. Responses were reverse coded such that higher scores indicated greater agreement with each statement.2.4. Procedure ::: 2. Materials and MethodsOnce Institutional Review Board approval was granted for human subjects’ research to take place, electronic recruitment was conducted using gatekeepers from across the university. Participation was anonymous and the online survey, created in Qualtrics, took approximately 10 to 15 min to complete. Participation in the study was voluntary and convenience sampling was utilized. Participants who consented to participate had the option to discontinue the survey at any time. Participants received no incentives to participate.2.4. Procedure ::: 2. Materials and MethodsParticipants completed anonymous surveys related to their relationship with exercise (i.e., Intuitive Exercise Scale (IEXS); [23]) prior to and during the pandemic as part of a larger survey regarding changes in eating and exercise during COVID-19. This survey was available to participants from February 2021 to April 2021. Demographic questions were included regarding classroom level, ethnicity, Hispanic or Latino, gender, major, age, and credit hours taken. Scale instructions were reworded to capture pre and during pandemic health behaviors such as “For each item think back BEFORE the pandemic (pre-March 2020)” and “For each item please check the answer that best characterizes your CURRENT attitudes or behaviors during the pandemic”.2.5. Quantitative Statistical Analysis ::: 2. Materials and MethodsEstablished scoring instructions were applied to the IEXS responses [23]. All statistical analyses were conducted using R/RStudio v.1.4.1717. Each participant’s total score and subscale score results were calculated for “Pre” and “During” responses. We conducted paired samples t-tests to examine differences in mean IEXS scores prior to (“pre”) and during (“during”) the pandemic. Higher scores on the intuitive exercise scale represented a higher tendency toward intuitive exercise before or during COVID-19. We also utilized structural equation modeling to examine how IEXS scores, both prior to and during the pandemic, predicted attitudes related to exercise during the pandemic. As such, we conducted two separate structural equation models estimated using the lavaan package in RStudio v.1.4.1717. The first model used IEXS scores before the start of the pandemic to predict attitudes related to exercise during the pandemic. The second model used IEXS scores during the pandemic to predict attitudes related to exercise during the pandemic. The hypothesized structural model is described graphically in Figure 1. Circles represent latent variables whereas rectangles represent measured variables. We used maximum likelihood estimation (MI) for each of our models. No significant issues associated with multivariate normality were detected (e.g., −3 < skew < 3, −10 < kurtosis < 10). Further, there was no missing data in our sample. It is important to note that the intuitive exercise scale had poor reliability (i.e., internal consistency) for scores before (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.59) and during COVID-19 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.63), so these results should be interpreted with caution. Due to the poor reliability of the overall intuitive exercise scale among our participants, we decided to conduct the remainder of the analyses on the subscales of the measure.2.6. Qualitative Analysis ::: 2. Materials and MethodsParticipants’ open-ended responses were downloaded into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in preparation for a thematic analysis of the descriptive data. Open-ended responses to question 18 (eating), 19 (exercise), and 23 (other comments), were analyzed by five independent reviewers. Using Braun and Clarke’s Inductive Analysis Approach, the open-ended answers for the three questions were examined for patterns [36]. The analysis was completed in stages. First, each reviewer independently read through all the responses and noted any patterns. Second, major overlaps and commonalities in all the answers were discovered and coded. These codes were then made into themes and subthemes that categorized most of the data/responses. Based on the themes and subthemes established, responses were then color-coded and categorized. To establish credibility, each stage of the analysis was conducted independently. Then, the reviewers collaborated, reviewed, and discussed the results and patterns together to reach an inter-coder agreement to generate a finalized list of themes with a color key [37,38]. After coding each response by theme, counts were made for each theme. In addition, note-worthy comments and responses from participants were recognized that exemplified each theme.3.1. IEXS Analysis ::: 3. ResultsIntuitive exercise was demonstrated by participants reporting greater trust in one’s body, less exercise driven by emotion, more exercise variety in types of activities chosen, and being more mindful during exercise. Intuitive exercise overall before COVID-19 (M = 3.30, SD = 0.45) was significantly lower than during COVID-19 (M = 3.36, SD = 0.47), t(215) = −2.24, p = 0.03, d = 0.15. Body Trust before COVID-19 (M = 3.20, SD = 0.98) was significantly lower compared to during COVID-19 (M = 3.43, SD = 0.96), t(251) = −3.45, p < 0.001, d = 0.23. In addition, Exercise Rigidity (exercise variety) before COVID-19 (M = 3.62, SD = 1.00) was significantly lower than during COVID-19 (M = 3.78, SD = 0.99), t(215) = −2.12, p = 0.03, d = 0.14. There were no differences before and during COVID-19 in Emotional Exercise or Mindful Exercise (ps > 0.34).3.2.1. Intuitive Exercise before the Pandemic Predicting Exercise Attitudes and Behaviors during the Pandemic ::: 3.2. SEM Analysis ::: 3. ResultsThe hypothesized model for intuitive exercise before the pandemic appeared to be a proper fit for the data. The CFI (i.e., comparative fit index, which examines the discrepancy between the data and the hypothesized model, adjusting for errors associated with sample size not addressed in the chi-squared test) was 0.97; the TLI (i.e.,Tucker-Lewis index is another model fit statistic that penalizes for model complexity (more parameters = more penalization)) was 0.96; and the RMSEA (i.e., root mean square error of approximation, is a fit index based on the non-centrality parameter) was 0.06, CI90[0.04, 0.07]. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were 9601.65 and 9834.55, respectively. The chi-squared model was significant, X2(101) = 167.85. However, there were no significant direct effects, meaning that intuitive exercise before the pandemic did not predict exercise attitudes and behaviors during the pandemic (ps > 0.15; see Figure 2). See Table 2 and Table 3 for descriptive data and correlations between variables for the first model.3.2.2. Intuitive Exercise during the Pandemic Predicting Exercise Attitudes and Behaviors during the Pandemic ::: 3.2. SEM Analysis ::: 3. ResultsThe hypothesized model for intuitive exercise during the pandemic also appeared to be a good fit for the data. The CFI was 0.97; the TLI was 0.97; and the RMSEA was 0.06, CI90[0.04, 0.07]. The AIC and BIC were 9077.51 and 9310.41, respectively. The chi-squared model was significant, X2(101) = 168.09. See Figure 3 for a visual depiction of the results. Emotional exercise during the pandemic predicted participants’ agreement with two statements: having more emotional exercise was associated with less agreement that their relationship with exercise became more positive (β = −0.31) and that they had exercised more during the pandemic (β = −0.21). Exercise rigidity during the pandemic also predicted agreement with two statements: greater exercise rigidity (exercise variety) was associated with greater agreement that their relationship with exercise became more positive (β = 0.22) and that they had exercised more (β = 0.28) during the pandemic. Lastly, more mindful exercise predicted less agreement with the statements that participants’ relationship with exercise became more positive (β = −0.15) and that they had exercised more during the pandemic (β = −0.16). Exercise rigidity (p = 0.09) and mindful exercise (p = 0.06) were also marginally associated with participants’ perception of weight gain during the pandemic. Exercise rigidity (exercise variety) predicted less agreement with a perception of weight gain, whereas mindful exercise predicted greater agreement with a perception of weight gain. All other paths were nonsignificant (p > 0.25). See Table 4 and Table 5 for descriptives and correlations between variables for the second model.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsThe descriptive findings illuminated how college students viewed their exercise patterns during the pandemic. After conducting a thematic analysis, many overlapping themes and subthemes emerged to illuminate patterns within the participants’ health-related responses to the pandemic. Themes and subthemes were established by identifying patterns of reoccurring words, phrases, and ideas at least approximately three to four times in the students’ responses. Students’ descriptions of their exercise patterns during the pandemic were classified into three major themes: increase in exercise, decrease in exercise, and no change in exercise. In addition, several subthemes emerged, which are described below. See Table 6 for overall themes and subthemes.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsIncrease in Exercise Theme. The first theme, engaging in more exercise, can be seen in many responses with phrases such as “started an exercise routine”, “increased time for exercise”, “more exercise from more time at home”, and “I have been more active since the pandemic has started”. Some students explained their physical activity changes as a way for them to escape the house and go outside: “I exercised more during the lock down, than now. During the lockdown going on a walk or run was the only way I was allowed out of the house, so I went on them frequently”. Another student similarly noted they “have found myself enjoying it [exercise] more as a way to get out of the house”. Some chose to enroll in marathons: “I have started training for a 1/2 marathon, so I am exercising more and more regularly”. Another student mentioned they “started a couch-5k running program”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsVariety of Exercises Subtheme. One subtheme that emerged was an increase in variety and diversity in participants’ forms of exercise. Many mentioned increased levels of home workouts as facilities were closed. A participant described the many types of workouts they now engage in: “I have incorporated HIIT workouts, weight training and cardio into my routines instead of just running as a form of exercise”. Another student stated they changed their exercise through “more variations in my routine. Before I used to run as my main form of exercise but now I do yoga, Zumba, and various ab routines from online videos”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsExercising for Fun Subtheme. Another subtheme that appeared was people engaging in exercise as a form of fun and less for physical appearance: “I exercise more since the pandemic, but I exercise differently, I used to exercise for lacrosse but now I just exercise to stay healthy and because it makes me feel good”. Similarly, another student explained: “I started exercising for fun instead of being particular about body image”. Others had more time to discover the types of exercises they enjoy: “I have learned what exercises I like because I have had so much time to figure it out”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsMore Time to Exercise Subtheme. A third subtheme discovered was people exercising simply because they had “increased time for exercise”. One common reason was due to work and classes being virtual, as can be seen in one student’s comment: “I am engaging in a lot more physical activity now. This is because I have more time with my online classes”. Another person commented, “I would say my exercise patterns have improved. Before the pandemic, I exercised a lot, but now that my classes have moved online, I find myself having more time on my hands, allowing me to lengthen the amount of time I spend exercising”. One student reported, “I had more time to exercise so I began exercising more frequently, almost every day of the week. I found increasingly difficult exercise routines that I found fun to do”. Others used the extra free time to self-reflect. One person mentioned, “I have slowly been trying to increase my exercise with extra free time and having more time to self-reflect on myself”. Students had more time to explore various types of activity: “I have started exercising slightly more and I have had time to incorporate activities like walks that I didn’t get to do before”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsExercise Influenced by Emotions Subtheme. The last major subtheme observed was using exercise to cope with emotions. One participant revealed, “… The only times I ever exercise (now and before COVID) is when I’m stressed, depressed, angry, or frustrated. I basically only exercise to blow off steam”. Others use activity to manage their negative emotions: “I have wanted to exercise more since I cannot go out as much, and I still want to stay active and manage my negative feelings”. Others do it for the positive feelings they feel after exercising, “I exercise more than ever before as a result of the pandemic. The progress and challenge that I get from exercise has brought me a lot of positive emotions”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsDecrease in Exercise Theme. In contrast, the second major theme was people exercising less since the start of the pandemic. Many participants reported answers such as “exercising less”, “become more sedentary”, and “stopped exercising”. Many reported this decrease in physical activity due to various reasons that were then grouped into major subthemes.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsLoss of Motivation Subtheme. The first major subtheme is lack/loss of motivation. The pandemic has disrupted many individuals’ exercise routines, possibly affecting motivation, as they were required to find a new way to exercise. One response read, “I don’t have motivation to exercise in my apartment because it gets too stuffy and I have no support or motivation. Going to a gym or yoga/Zumba classes used to be a big help for me but now we can’t do that”. Another student stated, “Before the pandemic, I was extremely active and in shape. At the start of the pandemic, I still continued to work out. Eventually, I lost all of my motivation to stay active”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsFear of the Virus Subtheme. A second subtheme was the decrease in exercise due to fear of getting the virus. Many can no longer perform activities as they did pre-COVID such as going to fitness classes. One student wrote, “I exercise less because I do well with group exercises but I don’t feel comfortable exercising with others during the pandemic”; another student stated, “they vary on my mood, my fear of COVID keeps me from the gym”. Another mentioned, “…not going to the gym (because don’t want to be around people or exercise in a mask) so it’s harder to work out in a home setting and by yourself sometimes”. One described their fear of spreading the virus, “I have stopped exercising altogether- partly because I’m tired all the time partly because I don’t want to go outside and get someone sick or myself sick”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsGym and Facility Closure Subtheme. A third subtheme observed was a decrease in exercise due to the gyms and facilities being closed. One person wrote their exercise has “… changed during the pandemic drastically, due to stay at home orders and workout facilities not being open” whereas another said, “a lot less because gyms and school campus have hour restrictions and limitations”. Others added on by indicating their complete end in physical activity, “I couldn’t go to the gym, so I just stopped working out overall”. One respondent shared, “I’ve stopped my regular workout routines at the gym (cardio and weights). I occasionally get cardio exercise, but not how I used to”.3.3. Thematic Analysis ::: 3. ResultsAfter coding and counting the frequencies based on the major themes, 108 participants mentioned engaging in more exercise in their answers, whereas 73 participants reported engaging in less exercise. There were 36 respondents that noted their exercise levels did not change. In addition, there were 14 responses that reported a change in physical activity but did not specify an increase or decrease in activity level or intensity.Future Perspective ::: 4. DiscussionThere were limitations to this study. First, participants had to self-report their behaviors and may have answered in a socially desirable fashion. In addition, there may have been memory bias as participants were asked to remember before the pandemic. While this study only surveyed college students at a mid-sized university in the Southeastern region of the United States, in the future, the study could be replicated with a broader population, such as with a greater range of ages, races, and ethnicities. Having a broader sample will both allow for increased generalizability and a deeper understanding of the human response to a pandemic related to exercise. In addition, one could conduct focus groups to better understand the emerging themes from the open responses in more detail such as the impact on mental health, fear of the virus, and other themes discovered in our survey.5. ConclusionsThis study discovered how the global pandemic has impacted physical activity and intuitive exercise behaviors among college students. Students revealed developing a more positive mindset toward exercise during the pandemic as compared with before COVID-19. Specifically, Body Trust, Exercise Rigidity (exercise variety), and overall Intuitive exercise scores during COVID-19 were significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 scores. However, given the opportunity to elaborate on their experiences related to physical activity surrounding the pandemic, students identified varied reactions and ways that their relationship with exercise has evolved throughout the pandemic. The broad range of responses could be due to personal circumstances, such as some students being “social” exercisers; for example, the closure of gyms/facilities during the pandemic may have greatly hindered activity levels as students could no longer participate in group fitness classes. In addition, some students may have opted to limit their exposure to working out around others due to fear of contracting the virus. On the other hand, some students reported taking advantage of their extra time in the day to explore new ways to be physically active.5. ConclusionsThese findings can inform public health interventions to address adverse health behaviors, prevent potential health problems, and promote healthier and intuitive behaviors among young adults during a health crisis (i.e., global pandemic). In summary, it is important for health educators to recognize the individualized nature of a person’s health behaviors in response to the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic is complex; therefore, it is important to avoid a “one size fits all” approach. In response to these concerns, health educators may want to emphasize the importance of cultivating self-acceptance, practicing self-reflection, and developing awareness within a time of adversity."
Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 through recombination and strong purifying selection,"The severe respiratory disease COVID-19 was first noticed in late December 2019 (1). It rapidly became an epidemic in China, devastating public health and economy. At the beginning of May, COVID-19 had spread to ~150 countries and infected more than 3.3 million people (2). On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic.INTRODUCTIONThe etiological agent of COVID-19 (3), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (4), was identified as a new member of the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes a diverse reservoir of coronaviruses (CoVs) isolated from bats (5–7). While genetically distinct from the betacoronaviruses that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans (8, 9), SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest level of genetic similarity (96.3%) with CoV RaTG13, sampled from a bat in Yunnan in 2013 (8). Recently, CoV sequences closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from confiscated Malaya pangolins in two separate studies (10, 11). These pangolin SARS-like CoVs (Pan_SL-CoV) form two distinct clades corresponding to their locations of origin: The first clade, Pan_SL-CoV_GD, sampled from Guangdong (GD) province in China is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV-2 (91.2%) than the second clade, Pan_SL-CoV_GX, sampled from Guangxi (GX) province (85.4%).INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding the origin of SARS-CoV-2 may help develop strategies to deter future cross-species transmissions and to establish appropriate animal models. Recombination plays an important role in the evolution of CoVs (12, 13). Viral sequences nearly identical to SARS and MERS viruses were found in civets and dromedary camels, respectively (14, 15), demonstrating that they originated from zoonotic transmissions with intermediate host species between the bat reservoirs and humans, a common pattern leading to CoV zoonosis (5–7). However, nonhuman viruses nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found. Here, we demonstrate, through localized genomic analysis, a complex pattern of evolutionary recombination and strong purifying selection between CoVs from distinct host species and cross-species infections that likely originated SARS-CoV-2.Acquisition of receptor binding motif through recombination ::: RESULTSPhylogenetic analysis of 43 complete genome sequences from three clades (SARS-CoVs and Bat_SL-CoVs in clade 3; SARS-CoV-2, Bat_SL-CoVs, and Pan_SL-CoVs in clade 2; and two divergent Bat_SL-CoVs in clade 1) within the Sarbecovirus group (9) confirms that RaTG13 is, overall, the closest sequence to SARS-CoV-2 (fig. S1). Pan_SL-CoV_GD is the next closest virus, followed by Pan_SL-CoV_GX. Among the Bat CoV sequences in clade 2 (fig. S1), ZXC21 and ZC45, sampled from bats in 2005 in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, are the most divergent, with the exception of the beginning of the ORF1a gene (region 1; Fig. 1A). All other Bat_SL-CoV and SARS-CoV sequences form a separate clade 3, while clade 1 comprises BtKY72 and BM48-31, the two most divergent Bat_SL-CoV sequences in the Sarbecovirus group (fig. S1). Recombination in the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1) with other divergent CoVs has been previously noted (3). Here, to better understand the role of recombination in the origin of SARS-CoV-2 among these genetically similar CoVs, we compare Wuhan-Hu-1 to six representative Bat_SL-CoVs, one SARS-CoV, and the two Pan_SL-CoV_GD sequences using SimPlot analysis (16). RaTG13 has the highest similarity across the genome (8), with two notable exceptions where a switch occurs (Fig. 1A). In phylogenetic reconstructions, SARS-CoV-2 clusters closer to ZXC21, ZC45, and Longquan than RaTG13 at the beginning of the ORF1a gene (region 1; Fig. 1B) and, as previously reported (10, 17), to a Pan_SL-CoV_GD sequence in region 2 (Fig. 1C and fig. S2), which spans the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site in the spike (S) glycoprotein gene. When comparing Wuhan-Hu-1 to Pan_SL-CoV_GD and RaTG13, as representative of distinct host-species branches in the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, using the recombination detection tool RIP (18), we find considerable recombination breakpoints before and after the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM) (fig. S2A) (19, 20). This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 carries a history of cross-species recombination between bat and pangolin CoVs.Acquisition of receptor binding motif through recombination ::: RESULTSPan_SL-CoV sequences are generally more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than other CoV sequences, with the exception of RaTG13 and ZXC21, but are more divergent from SARS-CoV-2 at two regions in particular: the beginning of the ORF1b gene and the highly divergent N terminus of the S gene (regions 3 and 4, respectively; Fig. 1A). Within-region phylogenetic reconstructions show that Pan_SL-CoV sequences become as divergent as BtKY72 and BM48-31 in region 3 (Fig. 1D), while less divergent in region 4, where Pan_SL-CoV_GD clusters with ZXC21 and ZC45 (Fig. 1E). Together, these observations suggest ancestral cross-species recombination between pangolin and bat CoVs in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the ORF1a and S genes. Furthermore, the discordant phylogenetic clustering at various regions of the genome among clade 2 CoVs also supports extensive recombination among these viruses from bats and pangolins.Acquisition of receptor binding motif through recombination ::: RESULTSThe SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein mediates viral entry into host cells and therefore represents a prime target for drug and vaccine development (12, 19). While SARS-CoV-2 sequences share the greatest overall genetic similarity with RaTG13, this is no longer the case in parts of the S gene. Specifically, amino acid sequences of RBM in the S1 subunit are nearly identical to those in two Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses, with only one amino acid difference (Q498H)—although the RBM region has not been fully sequenced in one of Guangdong pangolin viruses (Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P2S) (Fig. 2A). Pangolin CoVs from Guangxi are much more divergent. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of this region shows three distinct clusters of SARS-CoV–, SARS-CoV-2–, and bat CoV–only viruses, respectively (Fig. 2B). While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses use ACE2 for viral entry, all CoVs in the third cluster have a 5–amino acid deletion and a 13– to 14–amino acid deletion in RBM (Fig. 2A) and do not infect human target cells (5, 21, 22).Acquisition of receptor binding motif through recombination ::: RESULTSAlthough both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the human ACE2 as their receptors (8, 23), they show a high level of genetic divergence (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). However, structures of the S1 unit of the S protein from both viruses are highly similar (20, 24–26), with the exception of a loop that bends differently (Fig. 3A). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the two S proteins is 1.2 Å over 174 Cα residues (24). This suggests that conformational similarity of the binding motif enables viral entry through molecular recognition of ACE2. These structural studies also thoroughly analyzed the contact residues between the S protein and human ACE2 (20, 24). Previous structural and mutagenesis studies have identified two hotspots, K31 and K353, at the S/ACE2 interface in SARS-CoV. In SARS-CoV-2, these two hotspots were slightly weakened because of different residues on its S protein, but the loop that takes different conformations from SARS-CoV provides additional interaction that strengthens the interaction (26). Among 17 distinct amino acids between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the RBM region (Fig. 2A), five contact sites based on the structural studies (24) are different, likely affecting RaTG13’s binding to ACE2 (Fig. 3B and table S1). The single amino acid difference at position 498 (Q or H) between SARS-CoV-2 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD is at the edge of the ACE2 contact interface; neither Q nor H at this position forms hydrogen bonds with ACE2 residues (Fig. 3C). Thus, a functional RBM nearly identical to the one in SARS-CoV-2 is naturally present in Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses. The very distinctive RaTG13 RBM suggests that this virus will not likely infect human cells efficiently. Indeed, a recent study showed that the RaTG13 pseudovirus is much less efficient than SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in using ACE2 to infect cells, and this is most likely due to the L486F and Y493Q substitutions, which result in lower ACE2 binding in RaTG13 (26). Therefore, it is likely that the acquisition of a complete functional RBM by a RaTG13-like CoV through a recombination event with a Pan_SL-CoV_GD–like virus enabled it to more efficiently use ACE2 for human infection.Acquisition of receptor binding motif through recombination ::: RESULTSThree small insertions are identical in SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 but not found in other CoVs in the Sarbecovirus group (27, 28). The RaTG13 sequence was sampled in 2013, years before SARS-CoV-2 was first identified. It is unlikely that both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 independently acquired identical insertions at three different locations in the S gene. Thus, it is plausible that an RaTG13-like virus served as a progenitor to generate SARS-CoV-2 by gaining a complete human ACE2 binding RBM from Pan_SL-CoV_GD–like viruses through recombination. Genetic divergence at the nucleic acid level between Wuhan-Hu-1 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses is significantly reduced from 13.9% (Fig. 1E) to 1.4% at the amino acid level (Fig. 2B) in the RBM region, indicating recombination between RaTG13-like CoVs and Pan_SL-CoV_GD–like CoVs. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has a unique furin cleavage site insertion (PRRA) not found in any other CoVs in the Sarbecovirus group (fig. S3) (27), although similar motifs are also found in MERS and more divergent bat CoVs (29). This PRRA motif makes the S1/S2 cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 much more efficient than in SARS-CoV and may expand its tropism and/or enhance its transmissibility (20). A recent study of bat CoVs in Yunnan, China, identified a three–amino acid insertion (PAA) at the same site (30). Although it is not known whether this PAA motif can function similar to the PRRA motif, the presence of a similar insertion at the same site indicates that such insertion may already be present in the wild bat CoVs. The more efficient cleavage of S1 and S2 subunits of the S glycoprotein (29) and efficient binding to ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 (20, 25) may have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to jump to humans, leading to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the rest of the world.Strong purifying selection among SARS-CoV-2 and closely related viruses ::: RESULTSRecombination with Pan_SL-CoV_GD at the RBM and the unique furin cleavage site insertion prompted us to examine the SARS-CoV-2 sequences at these regions. Amino acid sequences from SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and all Pan_SL-CoV viruses (group A) are identical or nearly identical in the region before and after the RBM and at the region after the furin cleavage site (S2 subunit), while all other CoVs (group B) are very distinctive (Fig. 4A and fig. S4). The average of all pairwise dN/dS ratios, defined as ω, among SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pan_SL-CoV viruses at the S2 subunit is ω = 0.013, compared with the much higher values ω = 0.053 in the S1 region preceding the furin cleavage site, and ω = 0.042 at the S2 subunit for all other CoVs (Fig. 4B). The much lower ω value at the S2 subunit among the SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pan_SL-CoV viruses indicates that this region is under strong purifying selection within these sequences. A plot of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions relative to Wuhan-Hu-1 highlights the regional differences across the region before and after the furin cleavage site (Fig. 4A): The S2 subunit is highly conserved among the SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pan_SL-CoV viruses (group A), while far more nonsynonymous mutations are observed in the rest of the CoV sequences (group B). The shift in selective pressure at the S1/S2 cleaveage site among these related viruses versus other CoVs begins near codon 368 (Fig. 4B): The two graphs show the cumulative plots of the average behavior of each codon for all pairwise comparisons in the input data, for synonymous mutations, nonsynonymous mutations, and indels of group A sequences and group B sequences. The nonsynonymous plot shows a marked change in slope (vertical step) in the group A sequences at codon 368 but not in group B sequences. Similarly, when looking at all the dS/dN ratios (ω) for each group A sequence compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence, we see that these ratios are much lower in the 5′ end of the region, before codon 368 (nucleic acid position 1104), compared with the 3′ end, and no such difference is observed in the group B sequences (Fig. 4C).Strong purifying selection among SARS-CoV-2 and closely related viruses ::: RESULTSThis strong purifying selection observed in the S2 subunit of the S gene is not unexpected given its role in cell entry by fusing the viral and host cell membranes (5, 19). Following the binding of receptor binding domains (RBD) to the ACE2 receptor, heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and HR2 within the S2 subunit rearrange to form the fusion core, bringing together the viral and cell membranes for fusion and infection (fig. S5A). Because of the mechanistic constraints for this assembly for fusion, the protein segments that take part in this assembly are well preserved (20, 31). Furthermore, some regions of the S2 subunit are covered by S1 in the trimer conformation of the S protein (fig. S5B). On the basis of the currently available, but incomplete, cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) structure of the S trimer, we estimate that 60 to 65% of the S2 amino acids are buried. This adds further structural constraints on changing amino acids in S2.Strong purifying selection among SARS-CoV-2 and closely related viruses ::: RESULTSWhile hundreds of new SARS-CoV-2 sequences are added to the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) repertoire every day (32), we note that the RBM region currently remains highly conserved. No amino acid within 6 Å of the ACE2 binding site has repeated variations, with the exception of G476S, a very rare mutation found in eight sequences from a local cluster in the Washington state, out of 6400 total sequences from GISAID (13 April 2020). In addition, we observe similar patterns of purifying selection pressure in other parts of the genome, including the E and M genes, as well as the partial ORF1a and ORF1b genes (figs. S6 and S7). The viruses affected by purifying selection pressure vary depending on which genes are analyzed. SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, all Pan_SL-CoV, and the two bat CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) are under the similar purifying selection in both the E and M genes (Fig. 5A and fig. S6). In the S2 subunit, similar purifying selection is only observed for SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and all Pan_SL-CoV (Fig. 5B). A few viruses including only SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and pangolin CoVs from Guangdong are under similar purifying selection in the partial regions of ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig. 5C and fig. S7). Strong purifying selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses, as indicated by consistently low ω values, suggests that these complete and partial genes are under similar functional/structural constraints among the different host species. In two extreme cases, amino acid sequences of the E gene and the 3′ end of ORF1a are identical among the compared CoV sequences, although genetic distances are quite large among these viruses at the nucleic acid level (Fig. 5, A and C). Such evolutionary constraints in many parts of the viral genome, especially at functional domains in the S gene, which plays an important role in cross-species transmission (5, 12), coupled with frequent recombination, may facilitate cross-species transmissions between RaTG13-like bat and/or Pan_SL-CoV_GD–like viruses.Frequent recombination between SARS-CoVs and Bat_SL-CoVs ::: RESULTSPrevious studies using limited sequence sets found that SARS-CoVs originated through multiple recombination events between different bat CoVs (10, 12, 21, 33, 34). Our phylogenetic analyses of individual genes confirms this and shows that SARS-CoV sequences tend to cluster with YN2018B, Rs9401, Rs7327, WIV16, and Rs4231 (group A) for some genes and with Rf4092, YN2013, Anlong-112, and GX2013 (group B) for others (fig. S8). SimPlot analysis using both groups of Bat_SL-CoVs and the closely related bat CoV YNLF-34C (34) shows that SARS-CoV GZ02 shifts in similarity among different Bat_SL-CoVs at various regions of the genome (Fig. 6A). In particular, phylogenetic reconstruction of the beginning of ORF1a (region 1) confirms that SARS-CoVs cluster with YNLF-34C (34), and this cluster is distinctive compared with all other CoVs (Fig. 6B). YNLF-34C is more divergent from SARS-CoV than other bat CoV viruses before and after this region, confirming the previously reported complex recombinant nature of YNLF-34C (Fig. 5A) (34). At the end of the S gene (region 2), SARS-CoVs cluster with group A CoVs, forming a highly divergent clade (Fig. 6C). In region 3 (ORF8), SARS-CoVs and group B CoVs, together with YNLF-34C, form a very divergent and distinctive cluster (Fig. 6D). To further explore the recombinant nature of SARS-CoVs, we compared GZ02 to representative bat CoV sequences using the RIP recombination detection tool (18). We identified four significant breakpoints (at 99% confidence) between the two parental lineages (fig. S9A), further supported by phylogenetic analysis (fig. S9, B to D). In addition, the two aforementioned groups of bat CoVs (shown in light brown and light blue in the trees) show similar cluster changes across the five recombinant regions, suggesting multiple events of historic recombination among bat SL-CoVs. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV shares a recombinant history with at least three different groups of bat CoVs and confirm the major role of recombination in the evolution of these viruses.Frequent recombination between SARS-CoVs and Bat_SL-CoVs ::: RESULTSOf the bat SL-CoVs that contributed to the recombinant origin of SARS-CoV, only group A viruses bind to ACE2. Group B bat SL-CoVs do not infect human cells (5, 21, 22) and have two deletions in the RBM (Figs. 1E and 2A). The short deletion between residues 445 and 449, and in particular the loss of Y449, which forms three hydrogen bonds with ACE2, will significantly affect the overall structure of the RBM (Fig. 3, C and D). The region encompassing the large deletion between residues 473 and 486 contains the loop structure that accounts for the major differences between the S protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3A) and strengthens the interaction of the latter to ACE2 (26). This deletion causes the loss of contact site F486 and affects the conserved residue F498’s hydrophobic interaction with residue M82 on ACE2 (Fig. 3D). These two deletions will render RBM in those CoVs incapable of binding human ACE2. Therefore, recombination may play a role in enabling cross-species transmission in SARS-CoVs through the acquisition of an S gene type that can efficiently bind to the human ACE2 receptor.Frequent recombination between SARS-CoVs and Bat_SL-CoVs ::: RESULTSORF8 is one of the highly variable genes in CoVs, and its function has not yet been well elucidated (5, 12, 35). Recombination breakpoints within this region show that recombination occurred at the beginning and at the end of ORF8 (fig. S10), where nucleic acid sequences are nearly identical among both SARS-CoVs and group B bat CoVs. Moreover, all compared viruses form three highly distinct clusters (Fig. 6D), suggesting that the ORF8 gene may be biologically constrained and evolves through modular recombination. The third recombination region at the beginning of ORF1a is near where SARS-CoV-2 also recombined with other bat CoVs (region 1 in Fig. 1A). This region is highly variable (5, 12), and recombination within this part of the genome was also found in other CoVs, suggesting that it may be a recombination hotspot and may factor into cross-species transmission.DISCUSSIONThere are three important aspects to betacoronavirus evolution that should be carefully considered in phylogenetic reconstructions among more distant CoVs. First, there is extensive recombination among all of these viruses (Figs. 1 and 5) (10, 12, 21, 33, 34), making standard phylogenetic reconstructions based on full genomes problematic, as different regions of the genome have distinct ancestral relationships. Second, between more distant sequences, synonymous substitutions are often fully saturated, which can confound analyses of selective pressure and add noise to phylogenetic analysis. Last, there are different selective pressures at work in different lineages, which is worth considering when interpreting trees.DISCUSSIONThe currently sampled pangolin CoVs are too divergent from SARS-CoV-2 to be its recent progenitors, but it is noteworthy that these sequences contain an RBM that can most likely bind to human ACE2. While RaTG13 is the most closely related CoV sequence to SARS-CoV-2, it has a distinctive RBM. In addition, a recent study showed that the RaTG13 pseudovirus is much less efficient than the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in using ACE2 to infect cells (26). SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly identical RBM to the one found in the pangolin CoVs from Guangdong. Thus, it is plausible that RaTG13-like bat CoV viruses may have obtained the RBM sequence binding to human ACE2 through recombination with Pan_SL-CoV_GD–like viruses. We hypothesize that this, and/or other ancestral recombination events between viruses infecting bats and pangolins, may have played a key role in the evolution of the strain that led to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. It is also possible that other not yet identified hosts infected with CoVs that can jump to human populations through cross-species transmission if they can successfully infect human cells through ACE2 or other receptors. An analysis of 6400 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID (36, 37) identifies only one very rare mutation, G476S that is a direct ACE2 contact residue. It was found in a local cluster of sequences from the Washington state. However, it is at the periphery of the receptor contact surface and so may not significantly affect the virus’ receptor binding affinity.DISCUSSIONAll three human CoVs (SARS, MERS, and SARS-2) are the result of recombination among CoVs. Recombination in all three viruses involved the S gene, likely a precondition to zoonosis that enabled efficient binding to human receptors (5, 12). Extensive recombination among bat CoVs and strong purifying selection pressure among viruses from humans, bats, and pangolins may allow such closely related viruses to readily jump between species and adapt to new hosts. Many bat CoVs have been found able to bind to human ACE2 and replicate in human cells (10, 21, 22, 38–40). Serological evidence has revealed that additional, otherwise undetected, spillovers have occurred in people in China living in proximity to wild bat populations (41). Continuous surveillance of CoVs in their natural hosts and in humans will be the key to rapidly control new CoV outbreaks.DISCUSSIONWhile the SARS- and MERS-originating strains have been found in civets and dromedary camels, respectively (14, 15), so far, efforts to identify a similarly close link in the original pathway of SARS-CoV-2 into humans have failed. If the new SARS-CoV-2 strain did not cause widespread infections in its natural or intermediate hosts, then such a strain may never be identified. The close proximity of animals of different species in a wet market setting may increase the potential for cross-species spillover infections by enabling recombination between more distant CoVs and the emergence of recombinants with novel phenotypes. While the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is still being sought, one thing is clear: Reducing or eliminating direct human contact with wild animals is critical to preventing new CoV zoonosis in the future.Sequences analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSAll 43 CoV complete genome sequences were obtained from GenBank and GISAID (36, 37) and were selected to be representative of the diversity (tables S2 and S3). Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1La sequence was generated by combining Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P1L (10) with some additional sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioProject database PRJNA5732983 (11, 42) to have a maximal coverage of the complete genome sequence for analysis. A new CoV sequence from pangolin (EPI_ISL_410721) (43) was not included here, as it became available after we had already completed the analyses in this study. Once it became available, we observed that it was as close to SARS-CoV-2 as the sequences we had already used and, hence, did not change the interpretation of our results. Whole-genome sequences were first aligned using Clustal X2 (44). The alignments for all coding regions were manually optimized on the basis of the amino acid sequence alignment using SeaView 5.0.1.Recombination analyses ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSSimPlot 3.5.15 (16) was used to determine the percent identity of the query sequence to reference sequences. Potential recombinant regions among analyzed sequences were identified by sliding a 400–base pair (bp) window at a 50-bp step across the alignment using the Kimura two-parameter model. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using the Generalized Time Reversible (GTR) model (45), and their reliability was estimated from 1000 bootstrap replicates. The positions of the analyzed sequence regions were based on those in the reference SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947). Recombination regions and breakpoints were also analyzed using the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) database (46) tool RIP (18) with a 400-bp window. Regions between breakpoints were identified using a 99% confidence threshold.Selection analyses ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSCumulative plots of the average behavior of each codon for all pairwise comparisons in the input data, for insertions and deletions (indels), synonymous (syn), and nonsynonymous (nonsyn) mutations and values of the ratios of the rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site and nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN/dS or ω), were obtained using the LANL database tool SNAP (47). To avoid counting instances where synonymous mutations were saturated, averages of all pairwise dN/dS ratios were calculated excluding pairs that yielded dS values greater than 1.Structure modeling of receptor binding ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSTo investigate the single mutation Q498H in RBM between SARS-CoV-2 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD, Q498 in the crystal structure of S/ACE2 complex was mutated to H498 using Chimera (48). Local energy minimization (only H498 was allowed to move) was computed using Chimera’s built-in functions. To investigate the impact of the deletion between residue 473 to 486 to the binding interface between SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2, a homology model with the deletion was generated using I-TASSER (49). The top five best models provided by the server have confidence scores (C-score) of 0.86, −2.33, −4.01, −4.17, and −4.49. The C-score was used to estimate the quality of the models, which should be between −5.0 and 2; the higher the value, the higher the confidence in the model (49). On the basis of the C-score, model 1 was used in Fig. 3D. The interaction of the RBD of RaTG13 and ACE2 was modeled on PDB 6M0J, a structure of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with human ACE2 (24) using the ICM software package (50), and the mutational differences of the Gibbs free energy (table S1) were calculated with the built-in algorithm."
An Updated Review of Computer-Aided Drug Design and Its Application to COVID-19,"Drug discovery is a lengthy process that takes around 10-15 years [1] and costs up to 2.558 billion USD for a drug to reach the market [2]. It is a multistep process that begins with the identification of suitable drug target, validation of drug target, hit to lead discovery, optimization of lead molecules, and preclinical and clinical studies [3]. Despite the high investments and time incurred for the discovery of new drugs, the success rate through clinical trials is only 13% with a relatively high drug attrition rate [4]. In the majority of the cases (40-60%), the drug failure at a later stage has been reported due to lack of optimum pharmacokinetic properties on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) [5]. The use of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) techniques in preliminary studies by leading pharmaceutical companies and research groups has helped to expedite the drug discovery and development process minimizing the costs and failures in the final stage [6]. The application of rational drug design as an integral part of CADD provides useful insights into the understanding of the binding affinity and molecular interaction between target protein and ligand. Additionally, lead identification in pharmaceutical research has been facilitated by the availability of supercomputing facility, parallel processing, and advanced programs, algorithms, and tools [7]. Furthermore, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods have greatly aided in analyzing, learning, and explaining the pharmaceutical-related big data in the drug discovery process [8]. Different methods employed in the identification of new inhibitors from chemical databases include pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and statistical learning methods. CADD can be broadly divided into structure-based and ligand-based drug design approaches, both have been widely used in the drug discovery process in the identification of suitable lead molecules. While the structure-based drug design relies on the three-dimensional structure of the target receptor and its active sites to understand the molecular interaction between the receptor and ligand, the ligand based-drug design depends on the knowledge of ligands interacting with the given target receptor [9]. Computer-aided drug design has a large number of success stories and continues to play a vital role in the drug discovery process [10]. In this regard, the approach has been utilized in proposing drug candidates against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which taxonomically belongs to the Betacoronavirus genre and possesses high nucleotide sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The epidemiology, genome composition, pathogenesis, animal models, diagnostics, and vaccine development with references to various computational biology approaches for MERS-CoV infections have been comprehensively reviewed by Skariyachan et al. (2019) [11]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded enveloped RNA virus approximately 30,000 bp in length which utilizes host cellular machinery to execute various pathogenic processes such as viral entry, genomic replication, and protein synthesis [12].1. IntroductionLike SARS and MERS, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsps) such as main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase etc., four structural proteins (envelope, membrane, spike, and nucleocapsid), and other accessory proteins. While the spike glycoprotein is essential for the interaction of the virus with the host cell receptor, the nsps play a major role during the virus life cycle by engaging in the production of subgenomic RNAs [13, 14]. The nonstructural and structural proteins, therefore, offer promising targets for the design and development of antiviral agents against COVID-19 [13]. The lack of effective vaccines or drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 and the high mortality rate necessitates the rapid discovery of novel drugs [15], and computer-aided drug design is believed to be an important tool to achieve the identification of novel therapeutics. There is a possibility of the development of effective lead molecules against COVID-19 by utilizing natural lead molecules obtained through virtual screening and pharmacokinetic prediction [16]. To speed up the discovery of a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, repurposing of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs is a promising strategy due to the availability of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of these drugs [17]. The availability of complete genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the elucidation of the viral protein structures through X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron microscopy, and homology modelling approach have allowed the identification of inhibitor drugs against the essential therapeutic drug targets of COVID-19. This review article provides useful insights into some of the common in silico methods used in CADD and how these methods have been currently used and can be of help in the drug discovery process of COVID-19.2.1. Preparation of the Target Structure ::: 2. Structure-Based Drug DesignWith the rapid advancement in structural elucidation techniques such as X-ray and NMR, the structures deposited and available in protein data bank (PDB) have increased over the last few decades. Owing to the limitations of experimental techniques, many target protein structures have not been solved to date [28]. Computational technique such as comparative homology modeling [29], threading [30], and ab initio modeling [31] has been quite successful in deciphering the structures of the proteins from their sequences. Homology modeling is a widely used computational method for accurately determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence using a suitable template structure [32]. It is a multistep process comprising of the following steps: (a) identification of template, (b) sequence alignments, (c) model building of the target (d) model refinement, and (e) model validation [29]. Protein threading is another method for protein structure prediction which is often used when (1) the target protein shares low sequence similarity with other proteins in the PDB (<25% sequence identity), and (2) the target protein shows structural similarity with some proteins in the PDB. Unlike homology modeling, which only takes into account the sequence similarity between the target and the template, protein threading considers the structural information (secondary structure, solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions) encoded in the template to enhance prediction accuracy [33]. The ab initio modeling is another computational technique which is preferably used if the target protein does not have any template structures in the existing biological databases [31]. It considers a global optimization problem to find the dihedral angle values for a given protein structure which contribute to the structure's stability (possessing the global or near global minimum potential energy) [34].2.2. Identification of the Ligand Binding Site ::: 2. Structure-Based Drug DesignThe information about the ligand-binding site is a prerequisite for carrying out specific docking. The knowledge of the binding sites can be extracted from the site-directed mutagenesis study or X-ray crystallographic structures of proteins cocrystallized with substrates or inhibitors [35]. While the experimental information about the binding site of many proteins is not available, there is plenty of software and webservers such as CASTp [36], DoGSite Scorer [37], NSiteMatch [38], DEPTH [39], MSPocket [40], MetaPocket [41], and Q-SiteFinder [42] which allows us to predict the putative binding sites of the target proteins. The bulky compounds which do not fit well within the binding site pocket are rejected during the lead identification procedure.2.3. Compound Library Preparation ::: 2. Structure-Based Drug DesignChemical compounds can be selected from chemical databases such as ZINC (N=230 million purchasable compounds) [43], PubChem (N=111 million pure and characterized chemical compounds) [44], MCULE (N=122 million synthetically accessible compounds) (https://mcule.com/), ChEMBL (>1.6 million distinct compounds) [45], DrugBank (N=14528 drug molecules) [46], and ChemSpider ( N=25 million unique chemical compounds) [47]. Molecular docking is performed with drug-like compounds which are filtered using Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) parameters and other risk parameters such as acute rat toxicity, carcinogenicity, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase elevation, hepatotoxicity, and inhibition of 3A4 oxidation of midazolam [28]. According to Lipinski's rule of five, a compound is considered to be orally bioactive if its physicochemical properties lies within the permissible limits such as molecular weight (MW) ≤ 500, partition coefficient between n − octanol and water) (logP) ≤ 5, number of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) ≤ 5, and number of hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) ≤ 10 [48]. Some commonly used ADMET properties include human gastrointestinal absorption (HIA), blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition, cytochromes P450 (CYP) inhibition, and plasma protein binding [49]. Besides the pharmacokinetic properties, drug, and safety, the synthetic accessibility of these compounds should also be taken into account.2.4. Molecular Docking and Scoring Functions ::: 2. Structure-Based Drug DesignMolecular docking is a computational technique to study the interaction between a target receptor and ligand at the molecular level and allows ranking of the ligands by assessing their binding affinity towards the receptor using various scoring functions [50]. The favorable binding poses of the ligands with a target active site rely on two factors: (a) wide conformational space taking into consideration different binding poses and (b) explicit prediction of binding affinity of ligands corresponding to each binding pose [51]. A list of frequently used molecular docking programs is enumerated in Table 1. Molecular docking can be classified into two types: flexible-ligand search docking and flexible-protein docking. The ligand flexibility in the case of the flexible-ligand search docking method most commonly uses three algorithms such as systematic method, stochastic method, and simulation method [52], whereas flexible-protein docking usually relies on Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamic (MD) methods [53, 54].2.5. Molecular Dynamic (MD) Simulation ::: 2. Structure-Based Drug DesignThe MD simulation of a protein was first performed in the late 1970s [55]. This powerful physical technique is used to predict the positions of each atom in a molecular system with respect to time which is based on Newton's laws of motions governing interatomic interactions [56]. The forces between interacting atoms are estimated using a suitable force field which is used to determine the overall energy of the system [57]. MD simulations have been widely used for several reasons. The position and motion of every atom of the system are captured at every point in time, which is quite tough using any experimental technique. The simulation conditions are exactly known and can be carefully modulated [58]. MD simulations have been extensively used in the structure-based drug discovery process as this technique helps to unravel many atomistic details such as binding, unbinding, and conformational changes in the receptor at a fine resolution which normally cannot be obtained from experimental studies [59, 60]. Further, using MD simulation it is possible to explore the dynamics of receptor-ligand interactions (association and dissociation) and quantify the thermodynamics, kinetics, and free energy landscape [61]. Some examples of MD simulation programs include GROMACS, AMBER, CHARMM, NAMD, and Desmond (Table 2).3.1. Pharmacophore Modeling ::: 3. Ligand-Based Drug DesignA pharmacophore model elucidates the spatial arrangement of chemical features in ligands that are required for interaction with the target receptor [78]. Some of the chemical features used in pharmacophore modeling include hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, aromatic ring systems, hydrophobic areas, positively charged ionizable groups, and negatively charged ionizable groups [79]. Ligands having different scaffolds but the similar spatial arrangement of key interacting functional moieties can be identified using pharmacophore-based virtual screening. The bioactive conformation of the molecules within the target binding site can be incorporated into the pharmacophore model. The pharmacophore model is also often used in QSAR studies in the molecular alignment stage [80]. Some frequently used programs which allow automatic construction of the pharmacophore model include Catalyst, PHASE, LigandScout, GALAHAD, and PharmMapper (Table 3). A good pharmacophore model also incorporates spatial constraints in regions occupied by inactive molecules and often optimized further to make the model less restrictive. All the pharmacophoric features which are not consistently detected in active molecules are either made optional or removed from the final model [7]. The pharmacophore model generated should have optimum sensitivity and specificity to minimize the chances of false negative and false positive results and must be validated using an independent external test set [81]. If the information about the 3D structure of a receptor and a set of known active compounds are lacking, then a sequence-derived 3D pharmacophore model is quite useful. For example, Pharma3D utilizes knowledge of the 3D crystal structures and homology models to derive the common sequence motif important for receptor-ligand biomolecular interactions in protein families [81, 82].3.2. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) ::: 3. Ligand-Based Drug DesignQSAR studies are based on the principle that variations in the bioactivity of the compounds can be correlated with changes in the molecular structures. They are widely used in the drug discovery process in the hit to lead identification or lead optimization. A statistical model is constructed using these correlation studies, and the final model can be used to predict the biological activity of new molecules [80]. The key requirements for the generation of a reliable QSAR model are (a) a sufficient number of data sets with biological activities obtained from common experimental protocols, (b) the training and test set compounds must be appropriately selected, (c) no autocorrelation among the physiochemical properties of the ligands that may cause overfitting of the data, and (d) the applicability and predictivity of the final model must be checked using internal and external validation methods [96]. Based on how the descriptors are derived, QSAR can be classified into six different types: (a) 1D-QSAR which studies the correlation between global molecular properties such as logP and pKa with biological activities, (b) 2D-QSAR wherein biological activities are correlated with the structural patterns such as 2D-pharmacophores and connectivity indices, (c) 3D-QSAR which studies how the biological activities correlated with noncovalent interaction fields surrounding the ligands, (d) 4D-QSAR which is an extension of 3D-QSAR with the addition of an ensemble of ligand configurations, (e) 5D-QSAR which incorporates various induced-fit models in 4D-QSAR, and (f) 6D-QSAR further extends 5D-QSAR by including different solvation models [97]. Some examples of 3D QSAR programs include the HypoGen module of Catalyst [98], PHASE [89], comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) [99], and comparative similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) [100]. A list of tools for the calculation of molecular descriptors is enumerated in Table 4. QSAR technique can be classified into two types: linear and nonlinear based on chemometric methods. The linear method includes linear regression (LR), multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLS), principal component analysis (PCA), and principal component regression (PCR). The examples of nonlinear QSAR methods are k-nearest neighbours (kNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and Bayesian neural nets [97].3.3. Artificial Intelligence and Drug Discovery ::: 3. Ligand-Based Drug DesignArtificial intelligence (AI) is a type of machine intelligence that relies on the ability of computers to learn from existing data. AI has been used in various computational modeling methods to predict the biological activities and toxicities of drug molecules [97]. Further, AI has wide applications in drug discovery such as prediction of protein folding, protein-protein interaction, virtual screening, QSAR, evaluation of ADMET properties, and de novo drug design [103]. There are two powerful methods widely used in rational drug design which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) [104]. ML algorithms that have been extensively used in drug discovery include support vector machine (SVM) [105], Random Forest (RF) [106], and Naive Bayesian (NB) [107]. Few examples of the deep learning methods are convolutional neural network (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), autoencoder, and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBN) [4]. The conventional QSAR methods can efficiently predict simple physicochemical properties such as logP and solubility. However, the QSAR prediction of complex biological properties such as drug efficacy and side effects is often not optimal as the methods use small training sets [108] and has coverage of limited chemical space [109]. The big data generated using high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques are huge challenges to traditional QSAR methods and machine learning techniques [40]. AI methods have been developed to deal with this big data of high volume and multidimensional nature to efficiently predict drug efficacy and side effects in animals or humans. The most promising approach in the present big data world is deep learning which was first used in the drug discovery process in 2012 QSAR machine learning challenge backed by Merck [110]. The results showed that deep learning models were true which can accurately predict the ADMET properties compared to traditional machine learning methods. Although, AI is an impressing method in identification of preclinical candidates in more cost and time-efficient manner, and the accurate prediction of binding affinity between a drug molecule and a receptor using AI remains challenging for quite a several reasons. Firstly, AI is a data mining method whose performance heavily relies on the amount and quality of the available data [4, 111]. Variability in the source of data especially those derived from different biological assays and lack of high-quality data from public databases presents difficulty in efficient AI learning [112, 113].4. Case Study of COVID-19Both ligand-based and structure-based drug design approaches have been widely used in the drug discovery process against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), an infectious viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. To date, only a few drug-candidate molecules have undergone clinical trials, and these molecules are mostly repurposed approved drugs (Figure 2).4. Case Study of COVID-19The lack of approved drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 and the high mortality rate of the pandemic necessitate identification of effective therapeutics. With the availability of the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 [114] and structural elucidation of the viral proteins through X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy and homology modeling, COVID-19 research has been rapidly pursued. Some of the important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 are the structural protein-spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Figure 3); nonstructural proteins (Nsps) (Figure 4) such as the main protease which is also known as 3C-like protease 3CLpro (nsp5), papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), nsp15 endoribonuclease, nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase, nsp13 helicase, and host-based pharmacological targets are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, and cathepsin [115]. The details of the nonstructural proteins are briefly discussed here. The main protease is a cysteine protease with a catalytic dyad (cysteine and histidine) in its active pocket [116]. The action of the catalytic activity of Mpro on polyproteins results in the release of the vital proteins required for viral replication by cleaving at least 11 sites around the C-terminal and the central regions of the viral polyproteins with sequence consensus X-(L/F/M)-Q↓(G/A/S)-X [117, 118]. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is the second SARS-CoV-2 proteases potentially targetable with small molecules which cleave three sites, with recognition sequence consensus “LXGG↓XX” [118]. It is an attractive drug target because of its essential role in not only the cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins and assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex but also disruption of host immune responses [119]. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the cleavage product of the polyproteins 1a and 1ab from ORF1a and ORF1ab and is involved in the replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [120]. The catalytic core of the enzyme resembles the human right hand with differentiated palm, fingers, and thumb domains. Targeting this enzyme to halt the viral replication seems an effective therapeutic approach since the active site of the RdRp is a highly conserved and accessible region [121]. Nsp15 is a uridine-specific endoribonuclease involved in RNA processing and widely distributed in all kingdoms of life. Its catalytic C-terminal domain exhibits sequence similarity and functionality of the EndoU family enzymes [122]. The active 234-kDa hexameric enzyme cleaves both single- and double-stranded RNA at uridine sites generating 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester and 5′-hydroxyl termini [123]. The SARS CoV-2 2′-o-methyltransferase (nsp16) is another important enzyme target essential for viral multiplication. The enzyme precisely protects the viral RNA from the cellular innate immunity by participating in the formation of a specific arrangement known as RNA cap, a structure which contributes to viral RNA stability and effective process of translation [124]. SARS-Cov-2 Nsp13 helicase is one of the critical enzyme among the 16 known CoV Nsp proteins which shows the highest sequence conservation across the CoV family, indicating their importance for viral multiplication. The enzyme possesses the NTPase and RNA helicase functions that can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helix in an ATP-dependent process [125]. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a major host factor which regulates virus-host cell membrane fusion and cell entry by priming of the virus spike (S) protein via cleavage of the S proteins at the S1/S2 and S2 sites [126]. Furin is a type of proprotein convertases (PCs) found in the trans-Golgi complex and gets activated by acidic pH. The enzyme recognizes and hydrolyzes the unique “RRAR” motif in SARS-CoV-2-spike protein [127]. Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease belonging to a family of proteases involved in proteolysis of protein antigens produced by pathogen endocytosis. The protease cleaves the S1 subunit of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein which is required for the virus entry into human host cells, virus, and host cell endosome membrane fusion [128]. These structures solved through experimental techniques or computational homology modeling techniques can be used for structure-based virtual screening for identification of specific inhibitors of the target proteins.4. Case Study of COVID-19The CADD methods have been successfully used in the COVID-19 drug discovery process. Selvaraj et al. (2020) solved the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 guanine-N7 methyltransferase (nsp14) using the homology modeling method and further proposed five TCM database compounds—TCM 57025, TCM 3495, TCM 5376, TCM 20111, and TCM 31007 as potential antiviral phytochemicals based on molecular docking and simulation studies [129]. Gao et al.

Beck et al. (2020) used a pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called molecule transformer drug and identified a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral drugs such as atazanavir, remdesivir, efavirenz, ritonavir, and dolutegravir showing inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase [131]. Elfiky (2020) used homology modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, and molecular docking approaches to target the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme and reported the suitability of sofosbuvir, ribavirin, galidesivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, cefuroxime, tenofovir, and hydroxychloroquine as candidate drugs for clinical trials [132]. Elmezayen et al. (2020) used a structure-based virtual screening method to identify lead molecules against main proteases and human TMPRSS2. Four potential inhibitors against Mpro enzyme identified were talampicillin, lurasidone, ZINC000000702323, and ZINC000012481889, whereas promising inhibitors identified against TMPRSS2 include rubitecan, loprazolam, ZINC000015988935, and ZINC000103558522 [133]. Das et al. (2020) used a molecular docking approach to identify potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease by screening a set of natural products, antivirals, antifungal, antinematodes, and antiprotozoal. The inhibitors identified from the study include rutin (a natural compound), ritonavir (control drug), emetine (antiprotozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug), and indinavir (antiviral drug) [134]. Gurung et al.

Wahedi et al. (2021) explored stilbenoid analogues as potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies and identified piceatannol and resveratrol as important lead molecules for disrupting SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 complex formation [137]. Khan et al. (2020) attempted to target chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) with small molecules using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation approach, and the study revealed three FDA approved drugs (remdesivir, saquinavir, and darunavir) and two natural compounds (flavone and coumarin derivatives) as promising inhibitors of the target enzyme [138]. Further, the potentiality of many dietary flavonols as antiviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins (3CLpro, PLpro, S protein and RdRp) has been discussed comprehensively by Mouffouk et al. (2021) [139]. Umesh et al. (2021) screened chemical species from Indian spices using a computational approach (molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation) and identified carnosol, arjunglucoside-I, and rosmanol as potent inhibitors of the novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) [140]. Abdelli et al. (2021) explored essential oil from antiviral and antimicrobial plant Ammoides verticillata (Desf.) Briq. that blocks the function of the SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor using in silico approach (molecular docking, pharmacophore mapping, and MD simulation) and identified isothymol as a promising functional inhibitor of ACE2 receptor [141]. Al-Khafaji et al. (2020) employed a covalent docking screening procedure coupled with the MD simulation technique to identify molecules that can form a covalent bond with Cys145 within the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and identified FDA approved drugs: saquinavir, ritonavir, and remdesivir as top three molecules [142]. Peele et al. (2020) screened FDA approved antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, and plant-derived natural drugs with antiviral activity through molecular docking and identified lopinavir, amodiaquine, and theaflavin digallate as promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and confirmed their stability in the binding pocket of the target enzyme using molecular dynamics simulation [143]. Wang (2020) identified three potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease: carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir using virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials followed by MD simulation and binding free energy calculation [144]. Mittal et al. (2021) used antiprotease molecules for drug repurposing against COVID-19 and identified six potential inhibitors of main protease enzyme-leupeptin, hemisulphate, pepstatin A, nelfinavir, birinapant, lypression, and octreotide using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulation approach [145]. Using molecular modeling and virtual screening approach, Kandeel and Al-Nazami (2020) identified ribavirin and telbivudine as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme from a set of FDA approved drugs [146]. ul Qamar et al. (2020) used the homology structure model of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro for the screening of antiviral phytochemicals and identified three lead compounds 5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxy-2′-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone, myricitrin, and methyl rosmarinate as potential inhibitors of the target enzyme through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation approach [147]. Islam et al. (2020) used molecular docking and MD simulation technique and identified five antiviral phytochemicals, viz., hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and α-ketoamide-11r which showed a good binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme [148]. Beura and Chetti (2021) studied few derivatives of chloroquine using pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, binding free energy calculation, and ADME property analysis and discovered molecule CQD15 as a promising inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease which shows better interactions with the target enzyme as compared to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [149]. Mahanta et al. (2021) screened FDA approved antimicrobial drugs using a combined approach of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation and proposed viomycin as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 [150]. Enmozhi et al. (2021) explored the potentiality of antiviral phytocompound from Andrographis paniculata as an SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor using molecular docking and ADME prediction [151]. Kumar et al. (2020) screened hydroxyethylamine- (HEA-) based library of chemical compounds using molecular docking where HEA is a pharmacophore derived from indinavir. They identified compound 16 as a promising inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro which shows drug-like properties and stable binding within the binding pocket of the target enzyme throughout MD simulation studies [152]. Arun et al. (2020) used the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with an imidazole carboxamide inhibitor and generated an E-pharmacophore hypothesis for the repurposing of drugs. They identified two drugs binifibrate and bamifylline which bind strongly to the enzyme active site pocket as revealed from molecular docking, binding free energy calculation, and molecular dynamic simulation [153]. Gentile et al. (2020) screened marine natural product (MNP) library using hyphenated pharmacophore model, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation approach and identified a total of 17 compounds (belong to the class phlorotannins isolated from the brown alga, Sargassum spinuligerum) as potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors [154]. Amin et al. (2020) constructed a Monte Carlo optimization-based QSAR model and used it for the virtual screening of some inhouse chemicals. The thirteen identified compounds showed good drug-likeness from SwissADME in silico study, and molecular docking studies further show their favorable interactions with target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, thereby suggesting their potentiality as a seed for drug design and optimization against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro [155]. Similarly, Ghosh et al. (2020) used the Monte Carlo optimization-based QSAR model for screening a library of nature product hits. Fragment analysis of the active molecules suggests that novel potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme inhibitors may be synthesized by joining fragments/features together or attaching with other scaffolds [156]. Pharmacophore modeling is a fast and effective approach in the identification of interesting lead molecules for drug discovery against COVID-19. A ligand-based pharmacophore model was generated by Law et al. (2020) using established antiviral drugs, and the model was used to estimate the antiviral activity of twenty vanillin derivatives as Mpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Further, the structure-based pharmacophore model suggests that vanillin derivatives (1-20) exhibited promising results, and these compounds were suggested to be potent COVID-19 antiviral compounds [157]. Using the X-ray crystallographic structure of COVID-19 main protease (Mpro), Daoud et al. (2020) constructed a pharmacophore model and further conducted a molecular docking study to identify antiviral drugs as potential COVID-19 main protease inhibitors. Five FDA-approved antiviral drugs (lopinavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and raltegravir) were successfully captured by the pharmacophore model, and docking studies revealed that these compounds exhibit many specific binding interactions comparable to that of the cocrystallized inhibitor (X77) [158]. Skariyachan et al. (2020) explored the binding potentiality of six approved drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir, remdesivir, and ritonavir) against fifteen potential drug targets of SARsS-CoV-2 (spike glycoprotein, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, nsp7, nsp8, papain-like protease, main protease, nucleocapsid protein, heptad repeat of domain 2, ADP ribose phosphatase, nsp9 RNA binding protein, endoribonuclease, orf7a, nsp10, and nsp1) using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation approach and concluded that out of all the six drugs, ritonavir and lopinavir showed better binding with the prioritized drug targets [159]. Furthermore, the antiviral mechanisms of these drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) against SARS-CoV-2 have been thoroughly reviewed by Uzunova et al. (2020) [160]. Singh et al. (2021) performed docking-based virtual screening from a library of 1764 antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 (RNA polymerase) and identified five compounds, viz., paritaprevir, glecaprevir, velpatasvir, remdesivir, and ribavirin which exhibited high-binding affinity with the drug target [161]. Gowrishankar et al. (2021) screened a total of 57 phytochemicals from three most commonly used Indian herbs (Justicia adhatoda, Eucalyptus globulus, and Vitex negundo) used in “steam inhalation therapy” against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE2, spike glycoprotein, and RdRp using molecular docking approach, and the best five lead molecules identified were apigenin-o-7-glucuronide, ellagic acid, eudesmol, viridiflorene, vasicolinone, and anisotine [162]. Ibrahim et al. (2021) explored the potentialities of eighteen repurposed drugs in clinical development against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using combined molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) techniques and identified TMC-310911 and ritonavir as promising drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 [163].5. Strengths and Challenges of CADD in COVID-19 ResearchWith the steady rise in the number of confirmed positive and death cases from SARS-CoV-2 infection, computer-aided drug design (CADD) emerges as a fast and reliable technique in pharmaceutical and medicinal research since it not only saves time but also helps to cut costs of designing therapeutic agents [164]. Further, realizing the severity of COVID-19 and the lack of approved therapeutic agents warrants the need for finding potent drugs in less time, and the CADD method makes this possible by facilitating the discovery of new drugs or repurposing FDA-approved drugs whose safety and adverse effects are already known [165]. Since the inherent mutability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome may hinder disease prevention and treatment, CADD can be used efficiently to predict the effects of mutation on drug binding with the molecular receptors [166]. Therefore, CADD can greatly help in accelerating the drug discovery and development process. However, CADD methods have some limitations such as lead molecules derived from the virtual screening process that still need validation through preclinical and clinical assessments before market approval [167]. The fact that the molecular mechanism studies underlying the disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 are still underway, and the existence of bias and imbalance in the limited data available can have a major impact on the prediction accuracy of CADD methods such as artificial intelligence [168].6. ConclusionsStructure-based and ligand-based drug design form two branches of the computer-aided drug discovery process which plays a significant role in the design and identification of drug molecules in reduced time and cost. The increase in the number of positive cases and deaths from COVID-19 and the lack of approved drugs and vaccines continue to be a matter of global health concern which necessitates the urgent discovery of drugs for the prevention and cure of the disease. The structural elucidation of pharmacological targets of SARS-CoV-2 has helped the researchers in the structure-based virtual identification of inhibitors, and the discovery of few lead molecules against COVID-19 has led to the use of scaffolds that can be optimized through ligand-based drug design. Realizing the possible mutability of this RNA virus and the emergence of drug resistance problems, it is, therefore, necessary to take a step further and consider targeting multiple drug targets that will be more effective and might help in overcoming drug resistance barriers."
Who should be tested in a pandemic? Ethical considerations,"One of the many contentious issues in the Covid-19 pandemic has been the use of, and access to, tests for the disease. How can testing best be used as part of a strategy to curb and conquer the pandemic, and how should such testing be organized? Much can be learned from previous discussions on screening and other preventive measures, but the new situation of a rapidly spreading pandemic requires new deliberations. The present contribution is devoted to the most basic question in this context, namely: who should be tested? This involves both medical and ethical considerations; our focus is on the latter. We will deal primarily with issues that have arisen or are expected to arise in the current Covid-19 pandemic, but much of this will also be relevant in coming pandemics and large epidemics.IntroductionNext we provide a brief background on the currently available tests. Our discussions of the ethical issues are divided into four sections dealing with various practices that determine who will be tested, namely (1) priority-setting when resources for testing are scarce, (2) direct-to-consumer sale of tests, (3) testing of people with unclear legal status, and (4) whether testing should be mandatory.BackgroundTwo main types of tests for Covid-19 are available. [40] Virus tests detect the presence of the virus, which indicates an active infection. Antibody tests detect the presence of antibodies against the virus. In persons not currently infected by the virus, a positive antibody test indicates a previous infection and is taken as indicative of immunity.BackgroundVirus testing is usually performed on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens, collected with a swab and analysed with RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) technology. The test answers a yes-or-no question, namely whether the person is (at all) currently infected by the virus. Therefore, the criteria for sensitivity and specificity of such tests are well defined. The major problem with interpreting a virus test is to make sure that persons who test negative are informed of the short duration of the conclusion that they do not carry the disease. Unless this is fully understood and observed, negative test outcomes can potentially encourage risky behaviour. It should also be observed that inaccurate specimen collection can result in false negative tests, which suggests that swabbing should preferably be performed by professionals.BackgroundAntibody tests are blood tests performed to determine the level of antibodies against the virus in the individual’s serum. This is a quantitative, rather than a yes-or-no question, and it is assumed that more antibodies are associated with better chances of immunity. At the time of writing, the strength of that presumed correlation is unknown. It is also unclear to what extent other mechanisms than antibody formation contribute to immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, the duration of acquired immunity against the virus is unknown.BackgroundFor tests that measure a variable coming in degrees, sensitivity and specificity are not unequivocally defined. To define them, a threshold value has to be decided, and sensitivity and specificity will have to be related to that value. In this case, the threshold is an amount of antibodies present in the serum. If the test is intended for individual use, then positive test outcomes will expectedly lead to reduced caution against transmission of the disease. This means that the tolerance for false positives will have to be very low.BackgroundAntibody tests can also be used for population studies of the proliferation of the disease and the development of population-level immunity. For that purpose, tests with a lower specificity (higher rate of false positives) could in principle be used. In practice, however, it is unlikely that the individual results of such testing can be kept a secret from those tested. A policy of secrecy would also violate the right to know, firmly based in considerations of both autonomy and privacy [30]. Hence, most of those whose antibody levels are measured in a population study should and likely will get to know their results. This will in practice make the avoidance of false positives equally important in population studies as in tests offered for individual use. The statistical analysis on population level need not be restricted to the dichotomy between positive and negative outcomes, but can also make use of the exact antibody titres.BackgroundIn the following, we will focus on the use of virus and antibody tests to guide diagnosis and acute containment measures. In the clinic, a variety of other tests are needed, for instance to detect the cytokines storm that occurs in a subgroup of patients and may require specific (immunosuppressive) therapy. Tests are also needed in vaccine evaluation, and the evolution of the virus has to be carefully followed with RNA sequencing. Such tests will not be discussed here.Priority-settingIn an epidemic with a previously unknown pathogen, no vaccine is initially available. If vaccine development is successful, this can be followed by a phase in which vaccine is available but in insufficient quantity. Access to vaccine will then have to be prioritized [64]. Experience from Covid-19 has shown that the situation is similar for tests, although their development is faster than for vaccines. (This largely due to the trial phases in vaccine development, which were completed in unprecedentedly short time for Covid-19 [18]). Although virus tests were launched early in the pandemic, the initial tests required laboratory analysis. In combination with logistic hurdles and lack of equipment, this led to a shortage in the capacity for mass testing, even in industrialized countries. Testing capacity has been substantially increased through reassignment and reorganization of laboratory resources. It has been further increased by the development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), which do not require access to a laboratory. These tests are suitable both for point-of-care testing and screening. However, rapid tests are often of a lower quality, and they generate more false answers than laboratory testing. We are therefore facing two priority questions: who should be prioritized when it comes to testing and who should be prioritized when it comes to high-quality testing? Both these questions have much in common with the prioritization of scarce vaccines. However, there are also differences. For instance, contrary to vaccination, testing can potentially give rise to restrictive measures such as quarantining. The priority-setting of testing and vaccination should therefore be treated as different issues.Priority-settingExperience from other diseases such as malaria shows that access to RDTs is essential in countries with less developed laboratory resources [29]. The diagnostic situation for Covid-19 would have been much worse if the initial spread had taken place in countries with less developed laboratory resources. Therefore, capacity for speedy development and mass production of RDTs should be recognized as an essential component of global preparedness for epidemics with new infectious agents.Priority-settingLack or scarcity of testing resources is unavoidable in the early phases of a new infectious disease. In addition, scarcity can remain due to logistic inefficiency and/or lack of resources. This gives rise to a triage situation for the distribution of available testing capacity. The standard approach to prioritization in publicly funded health care is to base it on health care needs or potential benefits. (Sometimes principles of need are even understood partly in terms of potential benefits.) [24]. Needs, in turn, are typically understood in terms of severity: the worse off you will be unless the health care intervention is provided, the greater the need. This approach favours the assignment of testing capacities primarily to testing for the virus rather than for antibodies, since the former type of test provides information that is essential for the distribution of healthcare resources. Furthermore, this line of reasoning indicates that tests should be offered to those who would stand to lose the most if not tested. This is both intuitively appealing and caters consideration of justice and fairness [31].Priority-settingIn the current pandemic, individuals need testing primarily in order to obtain timely and adequate treatment. The need for early diagnosis in order to receive early treatment is largest for those who run a high risk of a severe development of the disease. This is a strong reason to prioritize virus testing of groups that are more likely to die or suffer seriously from Covid-19. Studies of previous pandemics show that mortality has usually been highest in the population groups with the lowest socio-economic status [42]. The socioeconomic profile of Covid-19 mortality has a similar pattern [34, 65]. High age and certain comorbidities substantially increase the mortality of Covid-19 patients [46, 51]. Needs-based considerations support the prioritization of these risk groups for testing.Priority-settingHowever, even if a decision is made to base priority setting on medical needs, this does not settle all issues in priority setting. Important interpretational issues remain. A high probability of death and severe symptoms increases a person’s need of testing, but arguably so do a large potential loss of life years and a substantial reduction of health-related quality of life. These factors sometimes pull in opposite directions. Take for instance age: the older you are, the more likely it is that you die of Covid-19 or suffer serious symptoms. However, on the other hand, with older age follows a lower number of expected life years that can be lost. This will strengthen the justice- or needs-based claims of younger people to be prioritized. In the end, this argument requires that we balance the probability of mortality against the expected number of life years that would be lost in the case of a fatal outcome. For Covid-19 it has been shown that vaccinating the oldest first not only saves the largest number of lives, but also maximizes the total number of remaining life years [23]. It is a plausible assumption that the gains obtained by testing have a similar distribution. For another pandemic disease with a different mortality pattern, this may be different. At any rate, the described value conflict needs to be recognized.Priority-settingMoreover, there are other considerations than only justice- or needs-based ones. There is an essential public health dimension in large-scale testing for Covid-19 and other pandemic diseases. Testing is essential for the targeting of preventive measures and for planning the medical response to the pandemic. Hence, what matters is not only a just distribution of testing, but also the dynamic effects of testing, i.e. the overall outcome. Testing that would not contribute much to curbing the pandemic may not be justified if the resources can be used for other, more efficient measures against the disease. For instance, at some stages of the pandemic it may be even more important to identify infected individuals with the greatest risk of spreading the disease than to identify those in greatest need of treatment. It may also be harder to justify large-scale population screening for the virus than testing that traces the spread of the virus in local outbursts. In the latter case, costs are limited and chances are usually good that the test outcomes can be used efficiently to contain the disease. Population screening may be useful if there is a lack of reliable information on the social spread of the disease, but if such information is already available, then the new information obtainable by (additional) screening may not be worth the resources it requires. Considerations like these can lead to a strategy that is adjusted to maximize the overall impact on the spread of the pandemic. In such a strategy, considerations concerning the just distribution of opportunities to be tested will be relegated to a secondary role.Priority-settingIn this broader public health perspective there is a special need for virus testing of health care personnel that care for infected patients. They are a scarce resource, and life-saving healthcare is threatened if the disease spreads among them. Furthermore, access to testing can be seen as a partial compensation for their exposure to risk [47].Priority-settingPublic health goals are more complicated than what first meets the eye. Often, it is presupposed that minimizing Covid-19 mortality is the most important goal. However, there are reasons to also consider other, more over-arching health goals. It is not clear that lower rates of premature death are best achieved by minimizing the mortality directly caused by the pandemic virus. Unfortunately, in particular in poor countries, some of the measures taken to fight Covid-19 tend to have unintended (although often foreseen) negative health effects. The disruption of routine vaccination has put at least 80 million children at risk of potentially deadly diseases such as diphtheria, polio and measles.1 Increased poverty and lack of public transportation due to Covid-19 lockdowns have prevented, and continue to prevent, people’s access to healthcare. According to one estimate, six months of impeded maternal and child care due to pandemic lockdowns will result in at least 250,000 additional child deaths and 12,000 maternal deaths [52]. Another serious concern is the increased prevalence of child malnutrition that follows from the disruption of food systems in low- and middle-income countries [28]. There are also indications that, even in rich countries, decreased use of emergency care for life-threatening diseases unrelated to Covid-19 may have led to excess mortality [37]. In particular in poor countries with severely limited healthcare resources, the prioritization of testing has to be considered not only in relation to other possible measures against the pandemic, but also in relation to other measures that are important for public health.Priority-settingIn summary, a country’s priority-setting for testing will have to depend on several factors such as the dissemination of the disease, the patterns of disease transmission, the country’s access to healthcare resources, and its situation with respect to the provision of food, water, and other basic conditions for human life.Priority-settingThe distribution of tests is not only a national but also to a high degree an international issue. The situation is analogous with that for vaccine distribution. Unfortunately, the initial distribution of Covid-19 vaccines among nations is largely based on their ability to pay, leading to a scarcity in poor countries that cannot be justified from a medical or humanitarian point of view. An interesting proposal has been made that vaccines should be distributed between countries according to a principle of “fair priority”. In a first phase with extreme shortage of vaccine, this principle implies that the distribution of vaccine between countries should aim at maximizing the expected number of life-years saved [16]. The same basic principles can be applied to scarce testing resources, for instance RDT equipment, although the details of such a distribution remain to develop.A market for testing those who can pay for it?In the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a considerable demand from the public for both virus tests and antibody tests, often for purposes that would not be prioritized according to the approaches to priority setting discussed above. Symptom-free persons may want a virus test to confirm that they do not have the infection, or an antibody test for immunity assurance. Many countries have plans for the introduction of “Covid-19 immunity passports” that would allow people to work and travel. [8, 35]A market for testing those who can pay for it?As indicated in above, there are considerable problems with such uses of the tests. The virus test (PCR test) had problems with false negative results in an initial stage of the pandemic, incorrectly suggesting to infected test-takers that they were not infected [39]. Even more importantly, a virus test only provides a momentary status, the individual can have the disease in the next few days after the test. Furthermore, practical difficulties in using the swab correctly might further increase the risk of underestimating virus infections. Currently available rapid antibody tests do not have the low rate of false positives that would be required for immunity guarantees, and they might therefore lure people into believing that they are immune when they are not. The seriousness of this problem in an early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic was well described by Ambati et al. [1]. With one test approved by the FDA in April 2020, 4% of the people who had not had the infection would incorrectly receive an immunity passport. If 2% of a population have had the infection, then two thirds of the passports will be issued to people who did not have the antibodies. (And, we may add, if 25% have had the infection, then about one in ten of the passports will be carried by a person without the antibodies.) Since then, antibody tests have been improved, and consequently the risk of issuing immunity passports to non-immune persons has been reduced. Nevertheless, both scientific and ethical difficulties remain. The comparative assessment of immunity acquired from the disease and from vaccination is far from trivial. Potential inequities in access to immunity passports can be considerable, and should be an important concern. [35, 48, 49]A market for testing those who can pay for it?All this adds up to make it essential that tested persons receive adequate information about how their test outcome should be interpreted, including help with applying this information to their own situation in life and—for the virus test—referral to adequate care. In general, self-testing not affiliated with a competent health-care provider who can offer such help should be avoided, in particular for serious diseases, since its use might otherwise lead to increased risk behaviour [54]. In situations where mass testing is needed, compromises may be necessary, but it should never be seen as a satisfactory or “normal” situation to provide testing for a serious disease disconnected from competent medical advice and access to treatment.A market for testing those who can pay for it?However, healthcare is nowhere apportioned solely according to needs. Its distribution depends on a complex combination of factors that shift with economic and political conditions as well as cultural habits and traditions. In almost all countries, a consumer demand for testing can be met not only by healthcare providers and public authorities, but also by businesses selling tests directly to consumers, usually without offering other medical services. It is clarifying to compare these activities with the sale of direct-to-consumer genetic tests for common multifactorial diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke and arthritis. A person who receives test results showing that she has a lower than average risk of coronary heart disease will act most unwisely if she takes this as a pretext for adopting or continuing an unhealthy life-style. For instance, if she smokes, then she may very well run a considerably higher risk of cardiovascular disease than a non-smoker with a higher genetic predisposition. In fact, the general life-style recommendations to avoid cardiovascular disease are essentially the same for all, independently of genetic risk factors [9, 41]. There is a similar risk of over-interpretation of direct-to-consumer tests for a pandemic disease. A person who received a negative virus test or a positive antibody test may believe herself to be exempt from precautions that would have been needed to avoid contracting and spreading the disease.A market for testing those who can pay for it?In an initial phase of a pandemic, when resources for medically indicated testing is limited by lack of testing equipment, measures that ensure their use for the prioritized purposes are appropriate. Such measures would temporarily close down the direct-to-consumer market. However, when such drastic measures are no longer needed, it would seem more adequate to regulate the sale of self-testing equipment, imposing requirements of test quality, adequate information, and access to advice by a healthcare professional who is licensed in the customer’s country of residence.Testing of people with unclear legal statusUnauthorized immigrants are in a precarious situation with respect to healthcare. Many of them are in greater need of medical attention than other residents. For instance, migrants in Europe are disproportionately affected by tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C [56, 63]. Their access to healthcare is limited or non-existent in many countries. This has negative health consequences not only for the adults who have chosen to migrate but also for their children. One example of this is lack of screening of pregnant migrants for diseases such as HIV and syphilis with significant mother-to-child transmission [61].Testing of people with unclear legal statusMany unauthorized immigrants have first arrived legally, but they have been denied asylum or overstayed a visa. In many European countries, newly arrived asylum seekers are routinely offered screening for a small number of infectious diseases, most often for tuberculosis [6, 33, 56]. Although migrants often appreciate this offer, they tend to prefer a general health check-up, which is of course also much more in line with their medical needs [6, 55]. Furthermore, participation in screening programs is often negatively affected by worries that positive test outcomes may reduce their chances of asylum. In general, unauthorized migrants tend to avoid seeking medical care, even if it is legally available, since they fear co-operation between healthcare and immigration law enforcement [26, 56]. Notably, this also affects children in these families.Testing of people with unclear legal statusLike everyone else, unauthorized residents are in need of medical attention in a pandemic. Testing and potential treatment of an infectious disease differs from most other types of healthcare in one important respect: it is obviously in the interest of society at large that unauthorized residents have access to these particular forms of healthcare. This should not be exaggerated. The common xenophobic scare of foreigners as the main source of dangerous infections is groundless. We are most likely to acquire disease agents from people with whom we have close physical contact or whom we meet on workplaces, in religious or recreational contexts, or in social life [4], p. 281. For instance, in countries where the pandemic is well controlled, screening (and/or quarantining) persons arriving from abroad can be an efficient means to prevent spread of the disease. Such screening should make no exception for asylum-seekers, but neither should it be targeted specifically at them. Returning citizens usually have a contact pattern that poses a greater risk of spreading the disease than the contact pattern of entrants with no close relations in the country. Nevertheless, inability to reach asylum-seekers, unauthorized immigrants, or any other group of residents can be a serious problem for the prevention of an infectious disease that potentially affects the whole population.Testing of people with unclear legal statusThe experience with previous screening efforts strongly indicates that it will be difficult to reach unauthorized immigrants with a program that has virus testing as its sole medical offer. It would also seem difficult, from an ethical point of view, to justify offering them only such medical service that obviously also serves the self-interest of other residents [6]. A society that offers comprehensive medical services to unauthorized residents is in a much better position to reach them in a future pandemic than a society in which they have had little or no prior contact with healthcare providers.Testing of people with unclear legal statusIn order to ensure that medical services, including testing in a pandemic, have the largest possible outreach among unauthorized residents, it is necessary to convincingly guarantee them that they do not risk legal sanctions by seeking healthcare for themselves or their children. Such a guarantee is also needed to ensure their participation in contact tracing. This is the firewall proposed by Joseph Carens:“Democratic states can and should build a firewall between the enforcement of immigration law, on the one hand, and the protection of general human rights, on the other. We ought to establish as a firm legal principle that no information gathered by those responsible for protecting general human rights can be used for immigration enforcement purposes... If [irregular immigrants] need emergency health care, they should be able to seek help without worrying that the hospital will disclose their identity to those responsible for enforcing immigration laws.” [11], p. 133)Testing of people with unclear legal statusProtective measures, diagnosis, and treatment against a pandemic should obviously be on the safe side of this firewall from immigration law enforcement. The same applies to coercive public health restrictions after a positive test, which have to be clearly separated from legal sanctions connected with the person’s migration status. Maintaining the firewall between health measures and immigration law is in the interest of all residents in the countries where the unauthorized migrants live.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?It has in general been accepted that testing for a disease should be voluntary, and subject to informed consent. (For instance, genetic testing without informed consent has met with considerable resistance and criticism, see [7].) This applies not only to tests in a clinical setting but also to screening tests offered to segments of the general population [32, 44], p. 28. A Uruguayan decision in 2006 that made biennial breast cancer screening mandatory for female workers to get a “health card”, which all workers need, was challenged as unethical and ultimately defeated [2, 58].Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?During the Covid-19 pandemic, participation in screening programs appears to have been an offer that citizens in affected areas could not resist. Since testing for the virus is an essential part of a strategy to protect also others than the tested person, a case for obligatory screening can be made that is much stronger than for non-infectious diseases. This is not the first time that such a situation has arisen. Before discussing obligatoriness in the pandemic case we will therefore consider three other cases in which exceptions have been made to the general principle that medical measures should be voluntary: screening for other infectious diseases, vaccination, and treatment of infectious diseases. These three exceptions all have in common that they concern the health of other persons than those who are subject to the mandatory measures, and they can therefore provide interesting insights for the issue of testing in a pandemic.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Screening for other infectious diseases: Already in the 1930s and 1940s, some American states required couples wishing to marry to be screened for syphilis. After World War II, when many soldiers returned home with the disease, most states introduced such programs. However, these testing programs were shown to be inefficient due to the high costs and the small number of previously undiagnosed cases that were discovered. Similar programmes for pre-marital HIV screening were introduced in the 1980s, but they were also shown to be inefficient. Obligatory premarital test programmes have therefore gradually been terminated. In 2019, the last state (Montana) abolished its mandatory premarital blood tests [15, 17, 27, 43, 59].Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?In South Korea, massive mandatory HIV screening was conducted in the 1990s in large segments of the population that had been identified as risk groups. This included sailors on international routes and workers in food factories, hotels, and inns. In 1996, 4.9 million persons were tested. Partly because of human rights issues, mandatory screening was drastically reduced, beginning in 2000, and funding was reallocated to treatment and public health education. A study performed ten years later showed that the proportion of late presenters among patients who received an AIDS diagnosis increased after the extent of mandatory screening was reduced, suggesting that mandatory testing may in this case have been conducive to early diagnosis of the disease [13].Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Vaccination: Already in the nineteenth century, scepticism against vaccination threatened the efficacy of vaccination campaigns, which led many countries to make vaccination obligatory. In the US, a landmark Supreme Court case in 1905, Jacobsen v. Massachusetts, upheld mandatory smallpox vaccination. Mandatory vaccination programs are still common in many parts of the world [19, 20]. They are supported by two major arguments [38, 50]. One of them is a paternalist argument, which applies to the vaccination of children. According to that argument, government should protect the health of children, and it can therefore override parental decisions that are detrimental to a child’s vital interests. The other argument is the disease transmission argument. According to that argument, everyone who can be vaccinated without significant health risks to themselves has a duty to be vaccinated in order not to contribute to the transmission of the disease. The role of the government is then to enforce that obligation. The disease transmission argument is particularly persuasive if the vaccine has less than 100% efficacy (so that others cannot fully protect themselves by being vaccinated) or if there are people who cannot, for medical reasons, be vaccinated.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Importantly, both the paternalist argument and the disease transmission argument are basically arguments for universal vaccination (with only medical exemptions). Both of them support mandatory vaccination only to the extent that obligatoriness is the best way to come as close as possible to universal vaccination. Whether or not that is the case is an empirical question.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?In practice, mandatory vaccination usually comes with non-medical exemptions, i.e. exemptions that can be applicable to persons who are medically eligible to be vaccinated. In particular, such exemptions have been granted to persons who plead religious or ideological conviction as a reason not to be vaccinated [38]. Unfortunately, even a small proportion of these exemptions can create public health problems, since people with such convictions tend to cluster in religious congregations or other social networks within which disease outbreaks can occur [45]. There are indications that the introduction of a legal requirement in a programme that already offers vaccination to all children leads to an increased rate of vaccination [14]. However, the effects of sanctions on the affected children should also be taken into account. For instance, the common way to enforce vaccination requirements in the United States is to deny non-vaccinated children school admission [19]. This means that children’s right to education is withheld in response to their parents’ disobedience of the law, which is an obviously questionable practice.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Discussions on obligatory vaccination have mostly been focused on childhood vaccines, but there is one case of vaccination of adults that offers interesting analogies for Covid-19 testing (and also for Covid-19 vaccination). That case is vaccination against influenza. Influenza is mostly trivial for younger persons, but for the elderly it is a serious and often mortal infection. The immune systems of elderly people react poorly to vaccination, with protection rates often around 50–70%. Along with other measures such as improved hygiene, vaccination of health-care personnel is considered to be an efficient means to reduce risks for the elderly. Proposals have been made to make such vaccination a requirement for working in direct contact with vulnerable elderly patients [60].Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Treatment of infectious diseases: Most countries have a legislation that can make testing and, if needed, subsequent treatment and/or quarantine obligatory for persons who can reasonably be expected to carry an infectious disease. This is based on a special feature of most infectious diseases, namely that the diseased person is not only a victim to the disease but also a vector who can spread it. (Tetanus, which is not transmitted via the common person-to-person routes, is a major exception.) This means that standard medical ethics with its exclusive focus on the individual patient and its emphasis on patient autonomy will have to be supplemented with measures aimed at protecting other potential victims [4, 5, 57].Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Many, probably most, jurisdictions have regulations that empower medical authorities to compel persons with contagious diseases to be treated and/or quarantined. It should be noted that these regulations are typically applied in situations with a stronger reason to believe that the person is infected than in most screening situations. For instance, persons who had sexual intercourse with someone who carries a sexually transmitted disease often run a considerable risk of being infected.Experience from other cases ::: Obligatory testing?Some jurisdictions mandate forced quarantine but not forced treatment. A patient can refuse treatment, but may then (as a last resort) be quarantined in order not to spread the disease to others. Forced quarantines have medieval roots, and are still practiced all around the world. In 1993 the New York commissioner of health was authorized to detain persons with tuberculosis for treatment in an isolation room on a guarded ward. Some of these persons were detained after they ceased being infectious in order to make sure that they completed their therapy, which is important to impede the development of multi-resistant bacteria [10, 21]. However, programs that have a strong focus on forced treatment or quarantine have been criticized for unnecessarily violating autonomy and also for discriminatory and stigmatizing practices. Although the need for such options as last resorts is generally recognized, some authors have warned against giving them a too prominent place on the agenda. For instance, some legislations have statutes specifically criminalizing behaviour that risks spreading AIDS, although such reckless behaviour has a relatively small role in disease transmission, and is already covered by existing criminal laws. Notably, such disease-specific laws tend to be directed at persons with an already stigmatized infection, such as AIDS. Concerns have also been raised that a focus on coercive measures can discourage people from contact with healthcare and, more generally, offset the trust necessary in disease prevention [19].Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?At least four important conclusions can be drawn from the comparative cases discussed in the previous section. First, it is important to distinguish between arguments for universal coverage of a diagnostic or therapeutic measure and arguments for making that measure obligatory. There are often good arguments why everyone, or everyone in a particular group, should undergo a particular medical procedure. This, however, is usually not a reason to make that procedure mandatory and legally enforced (for the group in question). In order to take the step from “desirable for everyone” to “legally required for everyone”, additional arguments are needed. Importantly, this applies even in cases when the measure has positive effects for others than those to whom it is applied, as is often the case for the diagnosis of serious infectious diseases. Even if it is a moral duty for instance to be tested, vaccinated, treated or quarantined for an infectious disease, that moral duty does not immediately translate into a justification of government enforcement of these measures. At the very least, for obligatoriness of testing to be justified, it must lead to a demonstrably improved health outcome that could not be obtained with alternative, voluntary measures.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Secondly, coercive measures can contribute to stigmatization and discrimination, which is a social ill that can hurt individuals as severely as disease. The risk of such effects is especially large for infections that particularly affect already discriminated groups, such as groups with an increased risk of AIDS. The surge in racism and violent hate crimes directed against Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic shows the dire consequences of fuelling xenophobic myths during a pandemic [12, 25, 62]. Public health measures should protect the whole population and actively reject discriminatory actions or messages directed against any part of the population.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Thirdly, when considering mandatory measures, possible evasive behaviours that may undermine them must be taken into account. If healthcare is associated with coercive measures, people who fear those measures may shun healthcare. This can have serious consequences for them and their families and, if they are carriers of an infectious disease, also for others.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Fourth and finally, it is imperative not to undermine public trust in healthcare and public health agencies. Health work depends crucially on trust, and short-term gains for instance in the diagnosis of an infection or vaccination against it may turn out to be Pyrrhic victories if they are obtained at the price of decreased public trust.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Based on these considerations we are now going to consider three groups that have been, or can potentially become, subject to obligatory testing for SARS-CoV-2: residents in an area, employees on a workplace, and border crossers.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Residents in an area: Massive testing of residents in affected areas has been an important part of the response to the disease in China and some other Asian countries. The extent to which these screenings have been mandatory is not clear to us, but obviously the question arises whether they could justifiably be made so. No doubt, it can be highly desirable that all residents in an area are tested in order to ensure that quarantining and other protective measures are adequate and efficient. However, as we have already mentioned, it does not necessarily follow that the most efficient strategy is to force testing upon persons who for some reason refuse it. One important reason for this is that their response to enforced testing might very well be to escape to some area where testing is not imminent. From the viewpoint of disease containment, this could be a worse outcome than if they stay, untested, in their area of residence. There may also be a risk that legally enforced testing exacerbates stigmatization of residents in highly affected areas.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Employees on a workplace: Workplaces are among the most dangerous places for transmission of infections, which is the reason for the massive lockdowns and transitions to home working during the Covid-19 pandemic. On workplaces that are still running, measures to prevent spreading of the disease are usually needed. Such measures include strict policies for staying home with symptoms, increased opportunities to maintain proper distance, hygiene opportunities and routines, safety clothing, and if possible access to testing and health care services. Mandatory testing may in some cases be warranted, but it has to be used with caution. In workplaces as well as other settings, the advantages of mandatory testing for disease containment have to be weighed against its potential disadvantages in terms of privacy and autonomy, and also against the risk that negative test results give rise to a false sense of assurance, leading perhaps to more risky behaviour or less attention to symptoms among tested personnel. If the sanction against employees for refusing tests includes reduced salary, then the test must be considered mandatory.Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?In some workplaces the need for procedures to exclude infectious employees from the workplace is particularly large, making it justified for employers to require testing. For instance, this is so in healthcare and at other workplaces with close contacts with vulnerable persons, e.g. in elderly care. There is already considerable experience from mandatory vaccination of health care workers, for instance against influenza [60].Conclusions for the on-going pandemic ::: Obligatory testing?Border crossers: Screening of immigrants against communicable disease has a long history. Beginning in 1891, the American Public Health Service performed medical inspections on immigrants, with the explicit purpose to exclude potential entrants with a serious infectious disease such as tuberculosis, a venereal disease, or some other condition that would make them “likely to become a public charge” [3]. Today, medical examinations at borders are routinely undertaken only in acute epidemics. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many countries have introduced virus tests and/or quarantines for people crossing their borders. The usefulness of these measures is doubtful when they are applied to travellers who travel between countries that are about equally affected by the disease. To the extent that testing of border-crossers is performed, it should be based on criteria that can be justified in terms of the purpose of the testing. A major example of a reasonable criterion is where the traveller has been in the period of time up to her arrival that corresponds to the incubation period of the disease. Examples of discriminatory and therefore also ethically problematic criteria are citizenship, social status, and resources to pay for an exemption.ConclusionsWe have discussed four major aspects of the question who should be tested in a pandemic.ConclusionsConcerning priority-setting when test resources are scarce, we propose that priority should be given to virus tests rather than antibody tests, and that distributive issues should be managed according to the basic criterion of health care needs. In the case of Covid-19, the application of this principle will support the prioritization of those with high mortality risk due to age and pre-existing conditions, even if the expected loss of life-years is taken into account. In addition to the distributive issues, the overall outcome of the measures against the pandemic also has to be taken into account. This can justify testing that contributes to effective contact tracing and disease containment, even in population groups with comparatively low Covid-19 mortality. In particular in low-income countries with scarce healthcare resources it is important to weigh the positive effects of Covid-19 testing not only against different types of measures to curb the pandemic but also against other healthcare measures such as child vaccination.ConclusionsConcerning commercial direct-to-consumer test services, we argue that in a phase with lack of test equipment, test resources should be reserved for medically prioritized testing. This will typically exclude direct-to-consumer services that are not part of healthcare provision. In a situation without such scarcity, the sale of self-testing equipment and services will have to be allowed, but they should be regulated in order to ensure test quality, adequate information, and access to advice by a healthcare professional.ConclusionsConcerning testing of people with unclear legal status, primarily unauthorized immigrants and their children, we emphasize that like everyone else, these residents need access to adequate medical attention in a pandemic, which may include testing. Obviously, inability to reach this or any other group of residents can be a serious problem for the prevention of a contagious disease that potentially affects the whole population. A society that offers comprehensive medical services to unauthorized residents is in a much better position to reach them in a future pandemic than one in which they have had little or no prior contact with healthcare providers.ConclusionsFinally, concerning obligatory testing, we emphasize that there are often strong reasons for universal testing, for instance in a residential area or on a workplace. However, the best way to achieve universal testing may not be to make testing mandatory. For instance, a person who refuses to be tested when testing is mandatory in her residential area may decide to escape to some other area, and possibly spread the disease to that area. However, in healthcare and other workplaces with close contacts with vulnerable persons, mandatory testing may be an adequate and justifiable measure.

Changes in business students' value orientations after the COVID‐19 outbreak: An exploration,"Values reflect what people find important in life. They are abstract goals and guiding principles that influence how people show up in the world, including their perception, preferences, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior (Kluckhohn, 1951; Roccas & Sagiv, 2010; Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). As such, values have been described as “central aspects of the self” that are relatively stable and quite resistant to both outside influences and inner resolution (Bardi & Goodwin, 2011; Konty & Dunham, 1997). That said, values influence people's moral reasoning and decision‐making (Gehman et al., 2013; Selznick, 1957; Weber, 1993)—two things which are necessary for leaders to navigate the myriad challenges business and society face today, including social and political unrest, climate change, and economic health challenges to name a few (Tsalis et al., 2020). Given the impact of leaders' decisionmaking on organizational outcomes (Diskiene & Gostautas, 2012), it is important to study the value orientations of business school students, many of whom will take leadership roles in organizations in the future. Prior research demonstrates that, in general, business school students in the United States hold a personal‐competence value orientation, reflecting a deep‐rooted prioritization of personal (over social) qualities and competence (over moral) characteristics (Weber et al., 2019; Weber & Urick, 2017). Assuming that business school students evolve into organizational leaders, the tendency for these individuals to hold a personal‐competence values orientation, and the general stability of values over time, has implications for the future. For example, although there is increasing public demand for organizations to address the triple bottom line, that is, people, planet, profit (Elkington, 2018), there may be little shift in this regard unless organizational leaders value the social and the moral. Given the stability of values, most research in the management and psychology fields has explored the stability of values with less focus on how those values can shift or change.However, values can change under certain circumstances (Rokeach, 1973; Rokeach & Ball‐Rokeach, 1989). Some literature suggests that values can only change negligibly (Feather, 1975; Lubinski et al., 1996). Other work demonstrates that significant life experiences can reorient and restructure the importance of certain values in more profound ways (Kohn & Schooler, 1982; Sheldon, 2005). In this camp, some authors have explored value shifts in response to traumatic events (Gavreliuc & Gavreliuc, 2016) such as cancer diagnosis (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011) and terrorist attacks (Murphy et al., 2004; Verkasalo et al., 2006), but this work has been minimal compared with work that explores values stability (Bardi & Goodwin, 2011). The COVID‐19 pandemic serves as an unprecedented collective trauma (Stanley et al., 2021) and thus presents a rare opportunity to examine a potentially major shift in business students' value orientations.The purpose of this paper is to explore if and how business students' value orientations are different before and after a major, life‐altering event. To do this, we compared aggregated responses from two comparable samples of business students regarding the importance given to the values in the Rokeach Values Survey (Rokeach, 1973). Responses for the first group were collected before the onset of the COVID‐19 global pandemic (Weber et al., 2019), and responses for the second group were collected 6 months into the pandemic outbreak when COVID‐19 influenced many aspects of the participants' lives. We compared the distribution for the first group's pre‐outbreak responses with the second group's postoutbreak responses. This pre‐outbreak versus postoutbreak assessment provides us with critical information about our investigated population's values orientations prior to and following collective trauma.Values stability and change ::: PERSONAL VALUESIn general, values do not change very much (Maio & Olson, 1998). Unlike behaviors, goals, or attitudes, values transcend context (Bardi & Goodwin, 2011; Janoff‐Bulman, 1989; Roccas & Sagiv, 2010) and have therefore been described as a dominating force in one's life (Allport, 1961; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987). However, certain life experiences can reorient and restructure the importance of certain values (Rokeach & Ball‐Rokeach, 1989). One such experience is adaptation, which occurs when big life transitions, for example, becoming a parent (Ferriman et al., 2009), experiencing a change in job conditions (Kohn & Schooler, 1982), or witnessing a major political shift (Danis et al., 2011), require a person to confront their default values (Bardi & Goodwin, 2011). When something major like this happens, people demote those values that do not align with the new context and elevate values that are encouraged by the new context (Bardi & Goodwin, 2011). Initial values change is often temporary (Verkasalo et al., 2006). As Bardi and Goodwin (2011) put it, “as life goes on and people do not constantly think about their values, the original values are likely to continue to operate” (275–276). To achieve long‐term change, a person must experience a situation that causes them to reinterpret future situations through their new value set (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011). One way this can happen is through traumatic life events.Collective trauma and values change ::: Value change with trauma ::: PERSONAL VALUES This is also true at the collective level (Sztompka, 2000). Typically, social value change happens over decades (De Vos, 1997; Hofstede, 2001) due to stabilized class structures and cultural conditions (Kohn et al., 1990). Even when political and social climates change, the values of a particular society tend to stay the same (Schwartz, Bardi, et al., 2000). However, collective traumas are one of the few conditions that instigate rapid social values change. Collective traumas are “a group level cataclysmic, tragic experience” that are both experienced and reproduced socially (Stanley et al., 2021, p. 1). These experiences can instigate societal values change by impacting the health and vitality of community or what Sztompka (2000) refers to as the body social: In medical parlance [trauma] refers precisely to the impact of a sudden event, leaving long‐term, destructive effects on the body, incapacitating it in some important respect. Extended to psychiatric discourse, it means a similar long‐term destructive impact on the personality, resulting in some form of mental or emotional incapacity. It may be worthwhile to give the term yet another connotation: to apply it to the social domain, to look for destructive effects on the body social. (Sztompka, 2000, 451–452). Collective trauma and values change ::: Value change with trauma Similar to the way a cancer diagnosis reflects physical trauma to the individual, collective traumas can reflect a “shock to the cultural tissue of a society” (Sztompka, 2000: 449). For example, in their study of Finnish students' values before and after the horrific 2001 terrorist attacks on the US World Trade Center, Verkasalo et al. (2006) found that students reported higher group level security values immediately following the attacks. Additionally, natural disasters (Hirschberger, 2018), radical economic reform (Sztompka, 2000), and genocide are collective traumas that can impact social values (Downing, 2007; Kahana, 1992; Paliewicz & Hasian, 2016). Just as traumatic life events can reorient individual values (Janoff‐Bulman, 1989), collective traumas can reorient values for groups of people.COVID‐19 as a traumatic event ::: Value change with trauma ::: PERSONAL VALUESTo qualify as a collective trauma, social change must involve the following four elements: (1) Temporality: it is sudden and rapid; (2) Substance: it is radical, deep, and holistic; (3) Origin: it is imposed from outside the victims; and (4) Mental frame: it is unexpected, unpredicted, and shocking (Sztompka, 2000). Given these criteria, the current global COVID‐19 pandemic is arguably one of the most significant collective traumas of the 21st century (Espinel et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020; Salari et al., 2020). While there have been other traumatic events in recent years—including one of the most divisive and polarizing political eras in United States history (Abramowitz & McCoy, 2019), as well as major upheavals in racial and social injustice (Buchanan et al., 2020)—COVID‐19 has been one of the most disruptive at scale. Not only has the pandemic impacted people's mental health globally (Furlong & Finnie, 2020), it has become enmeshed in other major collective traumas, including the ongoing political polarization (Lopez, 2021) and racial inequity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Over the past 20 months, the COVID‐19 pandemic has resulted in “enormous social, cultural, and economic tragedies” and reflects a major collective trauma both locally and globally (Stanley et al., 2021). As of September 2021, the pandemic has resulted in approximately 4.5 million deaths worldwide, with approximately 629,000 deaths in the United States (World Health Organization, 2021). For both the sick and the healthy, every aspect of life was disrupted, including work, recreation, socialization, and planning for the future (Stanley et al., 2021).COVID‐19 as a traumatic event ::: Value change with trauma ::: PERSONAL VALUESIn many ways, the COVID‐19 global pandemic mirrors on a collective scale, what a cancer diagnosis reflects on an individual or family scale—and, possibly, similar values change. Similar to the shock, uncertainty, fear, guilt, loneliness, and helplessness experienced in the wake of a cancer diagnosis (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011), the COVID‐19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of life and sent communities through equivalent emotional turmoil (Stanley et al., 2021). When people receive a cancer diagnosis, they face threats to both their physical and psychological well‐being. They are anxious about their families, their future, and their mortality (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011); likewise, COVID‐19 has left millions of people fearing for their lives and the lives of their loved ones (Center for Disease Control, 2020b). Cancer patients routinely experience or anticipate undesired changes to their employment, family structure, social relationships, and caretaking (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011); the COVID‐19 pandemic created similar insecurities, with shocking unemployment rates (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020), restricted social gatherings (Marcus, 2020), and travel bans (U.S. Department of State, 2020). Indeed, life, in the era of COVID‐19, has been completely disrupted.COVID‐19 as a traumatic event ::: Value change with trauma ::: PERSONAL VALUESFor both individual cancer diagnoses and the collective experience of COVID‐19, these dislocations in routine, behavior, and life‐worlds can alter people in dramatic ways (Sztompka, 2000). What is more, when faced with unexpected social disruptions, “the magnitude of value socialization (the degree to which values shift to reflect the new situation) mirrors the magnitude of change to the life of the person” (Bardi et al., 2014: 144). Although the individual experience of cancer diagnosis does not mirror the collective experience of COVID‐19 holistically, the main point here is that, based on the impact of trauma on values change, the collective trauma of COVID‐19 may impact societal values in a way similar to the impact of a cancer diagnosis on individual values. As Rokeach (1973, 1979) points out, values can change rapidly under conditions of significant socialization, self‐confrontation, significant emotional events, or cultural upheaval. The COVID‐19 pandemic reflects not one but all of these pathways to values change. While the future of COVID‐19 is uncertain, we can expect people to “struggle with the aftermath of trauma” and, as a possible consequence, “derive meaning, feel wiser, and face uncertain futures with more confidence” (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996: 469).COVID‐19 as a traumatic event ::: Value change with trauma ::: PERSONAL VALUESIn this paper, we explore the possible values change of business school students specifically. Prior to the pandemic, business school students tended to value personal (over social) qualities and competence (over moral) ones. Based on the above literature on values change in response to traumatic events, we consider whether business school students' values after the pandemic outbreak will reflect the social and moral leaning observed in extant posttrauma values research (Greszta & Siemińska, 2011).HYPOTHESESDespite the general stability of personal values (Janoff‐Bulman, 1989; Maio & Olson, 1998), we suggest that the trauma of the COVID‐19 global pandemic might contribute to changing the importance given by individuals to certain values found in the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS). In light of the research evidence and arguments presented earlier, specifically the prior work demonstrating people's values can change in response to individual and collective trauma, we expect differences in the value orientations manifested in our samples before and after the COVID‐19 outbreak (Gavreliuc & Gavreliuc, 2016; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996; Verkasalo et al., 2006). Specifically, we hypothesize that:Hypothesis 1As a collective group, subjects in our sample will manifest a different distribution of their value orientations when comparing the value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired pre‐COVID‐19 outbreak to the value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired post‐COVID‐19 outbreak.Despite the paucity of research in the business and society or business ethics fields regarding value change under the conditions of traumatic crises, we draw upon work published in psychology to explore and predict what value differences we may discover assessing personal value orientations for our samples before and after the collective trauma of the COVID‐19 pandemic outbreak. Verkasalo et al. (2006) provide one of the most relevant studies of students' value change after a collectively traumatic event: the terrorists' attacks on the New York City World Trade Center in 2001.HYPOTHESESDespite that these researchers used the Schwartz Value Survey—which is similar to but not an exact match to the RVS we used in our research—for their exploration of Finnish students' values after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in the United States, Verkasalo et al. (2006) found significant upticks in the importance attributed to values that demonstrated a concern for the security value type. Within the Schwartz Value Survey, the security value type reflects specific values that match those found in the RVS, such as family security, inner harmony, national security, and cleanliness. Although two of these values are associated with the Rokeach personal value orientation (family security and inner harmony), national security is a member of the Rokeach social value orientation, according to the value clusters reported by Weber (1990). Indeed, other scholars have reported that the experience of a traumatic event may weaken a focus on the self and strengthen attention to one's community. For example, Greszta and Siemińska (2011) used the RVS and discovered a decrease in values associated with the personal values orientation category—such as a comfortable life, an exciting life, a sense of accomplishment, and pleasure—and an increase on focus toward others, when their subjects encountered the notification of a cancer diagnosis.HYPOTHESESOur second hypothesis is directed at terminal value orientations, which denote values describing desirable “end states of existence” and include two overarching kinds of values: social‐ or society‐centered versus personal‐ or self‐centered orientations (Rokeach, 1973; Weber, 1990). Examples for social value orientations include prioritizing national security, equality or a world at peace, while examples for personal value orientations include prioritizing inner harmony, pleasure, or self‐respect.HYPOTHESESTherefore, if a difference is found in the terminal values of our two investigated samples, we will expect that:Hypothesis 2Subjects in our sample will exhibit a greater tendency toward a Social Value Orientation, as opposed to a Personal Value Orientation, when comparing the terminal value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired pre‐COVID‐19 outbreak to the value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired post‐COVID‐19 outbreak. Other results found by Verkasalo et al. (2006) are relevant for our prediction of value change among our research participants regarding the competence and moral personal value orientations. In their study of Finnish students after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in the United States, Verkasalo et al. (2006) found their subjects attributed greater attention toward the Schwartz value types of security and benevolence. Within these, Schwartz value types are values included in the RVS, such as cleanliness, forgiving, helpful, and honest. Each of these values is associated with the moral value orientation identified by Weber (1990).HYPOTHESESHence, our third hypothesis is directed at instrumental value orientations, which denote certain “modes of conduct” in everyday life and include two overarching kinds of values: moral versus competence value orientations (Rokeach, 1973; Weber, 1990). Examples of moral value orientations include being helpful, honest, polite, and forgiving, while examples for competence value orientations include being ambitious, independent, logical and responsible.HYPOTHESESTherefore, based on prior research, when investigating value‐importance attributed to instrumental values in the RVS, we hypothesize thatHypothesis 3Subjects in our sample will exhibit a greater tendency toward a Moral Value Orientation, as opposed to a Competence Value Orientation, when comparing the instrumental value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired pre‐COVID‐19 outbreak to the value‐importance ratings from subjects acquired post‐COVID‐19 outbreak."
Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the Coronaviridae.,"Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the Coronaviridae. It is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. The viral envelope contains three or four structural proteins, depending on viral strains (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The spike (S) protein is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 180 kilo Dalton (kDa). For some MHV strains such as JHM and A59, the S protein can be cleaved by a furin-like proteinase into two subunits: the amino terminal S1 and the carboxyl-terminal S2. The S1 subunit is thought to form the globular head of the spike and is responsible for the initial attachment of the virus to the receptor on cell surface. The S2 subunit, which forms the stalk portion of the spike and which anchors the S protein to the viral envelope, facilitates the fusion between viral envelope and cell membrane and cell–cell fusion (Chambers et al., 1990, de Groot et al., 1987, de Haan et al., 2004, Gallagher et al., 1991, Kubo et al., 1994, Luytjes et al., 1987, Nash and Buchmeier, 1997, Stauber et al., 1993, Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996, Zhu et al., 2009). It is therefore an important determinant for viral infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence (Boyle et al., 1987, Collins et al., 1982, Phillips et al., 1999). The small envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein play a key role in virus assembly (Vennema et al., 1996, Yu et al., 1994). The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a phosphoprotein of approximately 50 kDa and is associated with the RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid inside the envelope (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Stohlman and Lai, 1979). Upon entry into host cells, the viral genomic RNA serves as an mRNA for translation of the viral polymerase polyprotein from the 5′ most overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The polyprotein is then processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's), which possibly along with host factors form replication and transcription complexes that generate a nested-set of subgenomic mRNAs (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Snijder et al., 2003). Each subgenomic mRNA is translated into a structural or nonstructural protein. The structural proteins are assembled into virions in cytoplasmic vesicles (Vennema et al., 1996), which are then released (exocytosed) from the infected cell.IntroductionMHV can infect rodents, causing hepatitis, enteritis, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the CNS, acute encephalitis usually occurs during the first week of infection, and acute demyelination can be detected histologically as early as 6 days post infection (p.i.). By the end of the second week, if the mice survive virus infection, most of the viruses are cleared from the CNS, and demyelination develops. Although infectious virus can no longer be isolated from the CNS during the chronic phase (≈ 3 weeks p.i.), viral RNAs are continuously detectable by Northern blot or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demyelination continues to peak at around 30 days p.i., and then slowly decreases until over a year p.i., concomitant with viral RNA persistence (Bergmann et al., 2006, Das Sarma et al., 2000, Fleming et al., 1993a, Knobler et al., 1981, Knobler et al., 1982, Lavi et al., 1984). Although the mechanisms of MHV-caused CNS demyelination are not known, it is believed that the host immune response plays an important role in the demyelination process (Dandeker and Perlman, 2002, Fleming et al., 1993b, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Lane et al., 2000, Matthews et al., 2002, Sorensen et al., 1987, Wang et al., 1990, Wu and Perlman, 1999, Wu et al., 2000). It has been shown that the development of demyelination in mice is associated with viral RNA persistence (Das Sarma et al., 2000, Knobler et al., 1982), but the mechanism of CNS persistence remains largely unknown.IntroductionPreviously, a number of laboratories have attempted to establish an in vitro cell culture system for MHV persistence (Chen and Baric, 1996, Lavi et al., 1987, Sawicki et al., 1995, Schickli et al., 1997). While these studies have led to the establishment of MHV persistence in fibroblast 17Cl-1 cells, astrocytoma DBT cells and primary oligodendrocytes, infectious viruses continued to be produced, albeit at an extremely low level (Chen and Baric, 1996, Lavi et al., 1987, Sawicki et al., 1995, Schickli et al., 1997). Thus, such persistence does not resemble the phenomenon observed in mouse CNS. Although we have previously reported the establishment of a persistent, non-productive infection in a rat progenitor oligodendrocyte cell line (Liu et al., 2003, Liu and Zhang, 2005), the cells that harbor persistent viruses have not been confirmed, largely due to difficulty in separating infected cells from uninfected cells in a mixed culture. In an effort to establish a robust in vitro system that can faithfully recapitulate the in vivo phenomenon, in the current study we made several modifications in our experimental approach. We used a recombinant MHV that expresses a green fluorescence protein (GFP) such that infected cells can be easily identified and separated from non-infected cells. Using this approach, we were able to identify a new type of mouse oligodendroglial cell line (N20.1) that was persistently infected with MHV. Consistent with the results in rat progenitor oligodendrocytes (Liu and Zhang, 2005), viral RNA persisted for over 14 passages without the production of infectious virus. Significantly and unexpectedly, we discovered that persistently infected oligodendrocytes continued to produce viral particles but that these particles were deficient in incorporation of spike proteins on the virion surface, thus providing a mechanism for the lack of viral infectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first report in virology describing non-productive, persistent infection that continuously produces virus particles without infectivity due to a lack of spike protein incorporation.Establishment of persistent MHV infection in mouse oligodendroglial cells ::: ResultsWe previously reported the establishment of a persistent MHV infection in a rat progenitor oligodendrocytic cell line CG-4 cells (Liu and Zhang, 2005). However, it was not clear in that study whether all cells or only a fraction of the cell population were initially infected with MHV. This question is important because the mechanism of persistence could be different under these conditions. To unequivocally address this question and to identify additional cell lines for such studies, we used the recombinant MHV-A59/GFP, which expresses the GFP, and two additional mouse oligodendrocytic cell lines N20.1 (Verity et al., 1993) and Oligo-neu (Jung et al., 1995). The rationale for using MHV-A59/GFP was to quantitatively assess the susceptibility of the cell population to virus infection and to track the extent of viral persistence following continuous passage of the cells. Thus, CG-4, N20.1 and Oligo-neu cells were infected with MHV-A59/GFP at an m.o.i. of 10, and were observed for GFP expression. We found that less than 0.1% of the CG-4 cells expressed strong GFP at 24 and 48 h p.i. (data not shown) while approximately 25% of N20.1 cells (Fig. 1B, a–b) and < 20% of Oligo-neu cells exhibited strong fluorescence for the same time period (data not shown). Because of the highest cell number of GFP expression and relative ease in culture, N20.1 cells were used in all subsequent experiments described in this report.Establishment of persistent MHV infection in mouse oligodendroglial cells ::: ResultsInfected N20.1 cells were subjected to flow cytometric sorting (Fig. 1). Strong GFP-expressing cells were separated from non-GFP-expressing cells and were re-seeded into dishes (Fig. 1B, c–d), which were designated as VP1 (for passage 1 of virus-infected cells). To our surprise and disappointment, most of the green fluorescence disappeared by days 7 to 10 after seeding (Fig. 1B, e–f). Nevertheless, we continued to replenish the medium every other day and allowed the cells to grow to monolayers for additional 15 to 20 days. The monolayer cells were further passaged approximately every 8 days and were designated as VP2, VP3, and so forth.Establishment of persistent MHV infection in mouse oligodendroglial cells ::: ResultsTo determine whether the infection was aborted after disappearance of the green fluorescence at the end of VP1, monolayer cells (approximately by 30 days after seeding of GFP-positive cells) were collected and the presence of viral genomic RNAs in the cells was determined by RT-PCR using 5 pairs of primers that represent 5 regions throughout the viral genome (Fig. 2A). Indeed, viral genomic RNAs were detected with all 5 pairs of primers (Fig. 2B), confirming the presence of the viral genome. We then isolated intracellular RNAs from various passages of the infected cells (VP1 to VP14) and used RNAs from acutely infected (VP0) and mock-infected N20.1 cells as a positive and negative control, respectively, for RT-PCR with the primer pair 5′N and 3′N. Results showed that viral genomic RNAs were present in all passages tested (Fig. 2C). Thus, real-time qRT-PCR (using primer pair 5′qPCR and 3′qPCR) was used to further quantify the viral genomic RNAs in these passages. It was found that in general the amount of viral genome decreased drastically from VP0 to VP4, but relatively slowly thereafter (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that viral genomic RNAs established persistence in N20.1 cells for a period of time long after the disappearance of GFP expression.Loss of GFP expression is associated with aberrant transcription of subgenomic mRNA4 coding for GFP in persistently infected oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsSince viral genomic RNAs persisted (Fig. 2), we assumed that viral genomic replication must have taken place continuously, and so must have been the expression of the viral polymerase polyprotein, the ORF 1a/1b product. However, the eventual disappearance of GFP-positivity led us to further examine potential defects in viral gene expression in persistently infected N20.1 cells since the GFP ORF is under the control of the consensus intergenic sequence for subgenomic mRNA 4 (Fig. 3A) (Das Sarma et al., 2002). Thus, both the genomic regions encompassing the GFP coding sequence and the subgenomic mRNA4 at VP4 were specifically amplified by RT-PCR using the pair of primers 5′IG4–3′G5a and 5′Leader–3′G5a, respectively, and the PCR products were sequenced directly or following shotgun cloning. Interestingly, we found that the entire GFP ORF was intact within the persistent viral genome (data not shown) but that there were multiple species of subgenomic mRNA4 varying in size (Fig. 3B). These mRNAs contained a leader RNA fused at multiple sites downstream of the AUG translation initiation codon, thus effectively abolishing the expression of the GFP gene, a phenomenon reminiscent of the aberrant transcription described previously for MHV (Fischer et al., 1997, Zhang and Lai, 1994).Expression of viral genes in persistently infected oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsThe finding of aberrant transcription of subgenomic mRNA4 (GFP) led us to further examine whether the other viral subgenomic mRNAs were also transcribed aberrantly. Thus, the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs coding for structural proteins and their protein products was assessed in various passages of the persistently infected N20. mRNA7 (for N gene) and mRNA3 (for S gene) were detected in various passages of the persistently infected cells but not in mock-infected cells (Figs. 4B and C) by RT-PCR using a pair of primers (5′Leader–3′S1 and 5′Leader–3′N) that specifically detect the respective mRNA species (Fig. 4A). Similarly, viral N and S proteins were detected in these persistently infected cells by Western blot analysis and their expression appeared to decline over continuous passages when compared to the β-actin control (Figs. 4D and E). mRNAs for other structural proteins (M and E) were also detected (data not shown). These results confirm that virus-specific genes, especially structural genes, were expressed in persistently infected N20.1 cells.Absence of infectious virus following establishment of genome persistence ::: ResultsTo determine whether and to what extent infectious virus was produced during persistence, both culture medium and cell lysate were used for determining the presence of infectious virus in various passages by plaque assay. No infectious virus was detected beyond passage 2 (VP2) (Fig. 5A and further data not shown). To further determine the time point at which infectious virus was no longer recoverable, medium and cell lysate were collected at various days after seeding of the fluorescence-positive cells at VP1. The results showed that virus titer decreased gradually and reached to an undetectable level (the detection limit of the plaque assay was approximately 5 PFU/ml) by day 15 (Fig. 5B). These results, combined with the data shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, reaffirm that MHV established persistence of viral genome in oligodendrocytes without the production of infectious viruses or with extremely low level of infectious virus (below the detection limit). This phenomenon resembles viral RNA persistence in the CNS of MHV-infected mice.Biophysical and biochemical characterization of virions produced from persistently infected oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsSince no infectivity was detected in the medium and lysate of persistently infected N20.1 cells, we wondered whether viral particles had ever been made. Culture medium was collected from persistently infected N20.1 cells between passages 6 and 10. Virions, if any, were concentrated through 30% sucrose cushion and were further purified via 20–70% sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The gradient was then fractionated and the buoyant density of each fraction was determined. Presence of viral N protein was determined by Western blot using an N-specific mAb. As shown in Fig. 6A, N protein was detected in the fractions 5 to 10, which correspond to the buoyant density between 1.14 and 1.20 g/ml. The standard buoyant density in sucrose for MHV-A59 is 1.18–1.19 g/ml (Liebermann, 1982), which corresponds to fraction 8 in Fig. 6A. Since the majority of N protein was present in fractions 5–6, the data indicate that virus particles were likely produced but that they were slightly lighter than the infectious virus, suggesting some kind of defects with the virus particles. One possibility for a lower buoyant density is the lack of viral genomic RNA, i.e. virus-like particles. However, since the N protein is associated with the genome, the detection of N protein in the viral fractions argues against this possibility, although N protein can also interact with M protein during assembly (Narayanan et al., 2000). Nevertheless, to experimentally demonstrate this possibility, fractions 5 to 10 were combined. RNAs were then extracted for RT-PCR with primers specific to viral genome within the N gene-coding region. Indeed, specific viral genomic RNAs were detected in the purified fractions from persistently infected N20.1 cells (Fig. 6B, lane VP) and in virus samples derived from acutely infected 17Cl-1 cells that served as a positive control (Fig. 6B, lane V). Viral RNAs were not detected in samples derived from mock-infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6B). These results confirm that viral genomes were present in the fractions that represent viral particles.Biophysical and biochemical characterization of virions produced from persistently infected oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsWe next determined the viral structural proteins in the purified “virions”. We used antibodies to viral S, N, and E proteins in Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6C, all these viral structural proteins were detected. However, in comparison with the viruses propagated in 17Cl-1 cells, the amount of S protein was very low relative to the amount of N protein. We also noticed that the amount of S protein expressed in the persistently infected cells was extremely low at late passages (Fig. 4E). It is worth noting that due to the absence of infectivity for virion isolated from persistent cells, it was not possible to precisely quantify the virion protein by loading an equivalent PFU. Thus, the ratio of envelope proteins (S and E) to N protein was used as a measure for describing the relative amount of envelope protein per physical particle. In addition, the species of the virion S protein from persistently infected N20.1 cells appeared to be different from that from acutely infected 17Cl-1 cells. Similar phenomenon was also observed between the S proteins in acutely and persistently infected cells (compare with Fig. 4E). However, it remains to be seen whether this is due to differential glycosylation or other post-translational modifications. The E protein from persistently infected N20.1 cells appeared less abundant compared to that from 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6C, lower panels). We also detected the M protein from persistently infected N20.1 cells and 17Cl-1 cells; however, due to high background, we were unable to compare its relative amount in different cell types (data not shown).Morphological features of the virions isolated from persistently infected oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsThe detection of viral structural proteins and RNA genome in the purified sucrose gradient fractions in above experiments indicates that virions were likely assembled. However, the absence of infectivity prompted us to examine the morphology of the viral particles. Thus, purified virus preparations were subjected to negative-staining followed by electron microscopic examination. In general, diverse morphology of the virions had been observed in each grid for the same sample. The shape and size of the virions isolated from acutely or persistently infected N20.1 cells and from 17Cl-1 cells were indistinguishable. Interestingly, however, little to no spike was found on the virions isolated from persistently infected N20.1 cells (panels a–b). In contrast, virions isolated from acutely infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells exhibited the typical “crown” morphology of the coronavirus, i.e. the spike protein protruding from the virion surface to form a ring (panels c–e). Thus, it appears that the only obvious morphological distinction between infectious and non-infectious virions is the presence or abundance of the spike protein on virion surface observed under EM examination.Lack of evidence for mutations in the interacting domains of the viral envelope proteins during persistence in oligodendrocytes ::: ResultsIt has been suggested that incorporation of S protein into virion envelope requires the interaction between S and M proteins, more specifically between the transmembrane and amphipathic domains of M protein and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the S protein (Fig. 8A) (de Haan et al., 1999, de Haan and Rottier, 2007). While the E protein is not absolutely required for replication, lack of E drastically reduces viral replication and fitness (Kuo and Masters, 2003). Thus, to gain an insight into potential defects associated with S protein incorporation, we determined whether any mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domain of S protein or M and E proteins arisen during persistence might contribute to the lack of incorporation. We amplified a sequence at the 3′-end of S gene that encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain of the S protein (including the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail) from various passages of persistently infected N20.1 cells (Figs. 8B and C). We also amplified the entire ORFs of the M and E gene from acutely (VP0) and persistently infected N20.1 cells at passages 10 (VP10) and 16 (VP16) (Figs. 8B and C). Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products (Fig. 8C) revealed that there was no single nucleotide mutation at the 3′-end of the S gene and within the ORF for M and E genes (data not shown). These results suggest that deficient incorporation of S protein in the virions during persistence unlikely results from lack of interactions among envelope proteins due to mutations in the interacting domains.DiscussionThe hallmark of MHV persistent infection in the animal CNS is the persistence of viral genome without the detection of infectious viruses (Bergmann et al., 2006). To recapitulate this in vivo phenomenon it would be highly desirable to have a robust in vitro cell culture system, such that the molecular mechanisms of viral persistence can be carefully examined at the cellular level. In an effort to achieve that objective, over the past decades we and others have searched a large number of susceptible cell lines and primary cell cultures for their potential as hosts for MHV persistence. Although these investigations have established MHV persistence in many types of cells following various manipulations of culture conditions, persistently infected cells continue to produce infectious viruses (Chen and Baric, 1996, Lavi et al., 1987, Sawicki et al., 1995, Schickli et al., 1997). Only the rat progenitor oligodendrocyte CG-4 cell line has been reported to harbor MHV genomes without producing infectious viruses (Liu and Zhang, 2005). However, in that study it was not clear whether all cells had been infected with MHV (Liu and Zhang, 2005). It is more likely that only a small population of cells were initially infected with MHV or were permissive for MHV replication, because less than 1% of the infected cells exhibited strong fluorescence when stained with an antibody specific to MHV N protein (Liu et al., 2003). This suggests that only a tiny fraction of the cells may persistently harbor the virus. In the present study, we employed a recombinant MHV that expresses GFP. This improvement allows us to screen multiple cell lines for their susceptibility to MHV infection and to identify and isolate infected cells. Indeed, we found that ≈ 25% of N20.1 cells exhibited strong GFP expression (Fig. 1). Subsequent FACS sorting and subcultures of the GFP-positive N20.1 cells led to the establishment of persistent infection without production of infectious viruses (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4), which recapitulates the phenomenon observed in mouse CNS. Thus, establishment of such a faithful system paves the foundation for future mechanistic studies of MHV persistence in CNS cells.DiscussionIronically, non-productive persistence is established only in 3 cell lines of oligodendrocytic origin (mouse oligodendrocyte N20.1 and Oligo-neu (this study) and rat progenitor oligodendrocyte CG-4 (Liu and Zhang, 2005)) in spite of different conditions used for establishing these cell lines. This raises a possibility that this kind of MHV persistence is cell-type specific. CG-4 cell is a permanent, undifferentiated type 2 oligodendrocyte/astrocyte progenitor cell that was originally established during a primary neural cell culture derived from the brain of newborn (1–3 days postnatal) Sprague–Dawley rat pups (Louis et al., 1992). It is maintained at the progenitor state under complex culture conditions containing various growth factors. It can differentiate into mature oligodendrocyte upon changing culture conditions. N20.1 cell is a cell line clone derived from mouse primary cultures of oligodendrocytes conditionally immortalized by transformation with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the simian virus 40 large-T antigen (Verity et al., 1993). The Oligo-neu is a murine oligodendroglial precursor cell line established via transformation of a replication-defective retrovirus expressing t-neu oncogene linked to the external region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Jung et al., 1995). Although the 3 cell lines were derived from different animal species and were established by different methods, they appear to retain the susceptibility to non-productive persistence by MHV. This is in stark contrast to fibroblast (17Cl-1) and astrocytoma (DBT) cell lines (Chen and Baric, 1996, Sawicki et al., 1995), where infectious virus continues to generate. Another difference between the non-productive persistence in N20.1 cells and the productive persistence in fibroblast and astrocytoma cell lines is that persistence can be established only in mixed (infected and uninfected; susceptible and resistant) cultures of 17Cl-1 and DBT (Chen and Baric, 1996, Sawicki et al., 1995). In such mixed cultures with low multiplicity of infection, a small number of viruses released from a small fraction of cell populations can infect neighboring uninfected cells and thus the persistence can be maintained in an epigenetic fashion (Sawicki et al., 1995). The persistence in N20.1 cells was established following selection of infected cells. When GFP-expressing 17Cl-1 or DBT cells were selected by the same FACS sorting following infection with MHV-A59/GFP, continuous passaging of the GFP-expressing 17Cl-1 and DBT cells was not possible, due to extensive cell death for 17Cl-1 as described by Chen and Makino (2002) or extensive cell fusion for DBT cells. However, it has been reported that infectious virus continued to produce in persistently infected primary mouse oligodendrocytes (Lavi et al., 1987). One possible reason for the observed difference between primary oligodendrocytes and established oligodendroglial cell lines is that primary oligodendrocytes cannot be subcultured for many passages, thus leaving insufficient time for eventual cease of infectious virus production to take place. Another possibility is that culture conditions used for primary cells and cell lines might be different, which can affect cell proliferation and differentiation, which in turn affect virus replication and infectious virus production. A third possibility is that most primary cultures have a certain degree of impurity, i.e., contamination with a small number of astrocytes and microglia that can serve as a reservoir for infectious virus production, albeit at a low level.DiscussionOne of our initial purposes to use the GFP-expressing virus was to continuously monitor progression of the persistent infection. However, the eventual disappearance of GFP-positivity is unexpected. Interestingly, while aberrant transcription of subgenomic mRNA for GFP gene, a phenomenon reminiscent of the aberrant transcription described previously for MHV (Fischer et al., 1997, Zhang and Lai, 1994), was identified (Fig. 3), subgenomic mRNAs coding for viral structural proteins such as S, E, M, and N were transcribed with no apparent abnormality; further Western blot analyses confirmed the expression of these viral structural proteins (Fig. 2, Fig. 4 and further data not shown). Thus, it appears that MHV has the ability to selectively inactivate the GFP gene expression through aberrant transcription while keeping viral own genes continuously expressed. Why and how MHV can discriminate self from non-self during gene expression remain an interesting subject for future investigation.DiscussionIt has been known for decades in the coronavirus research field that MHV can establish persistent infection in the mouse CNS without apparent production of infectious viruses. This kind of so-called non-productive persistence is unique among animal viruses. The most intriguing question remained to be answered, however, is what the major defects in the virus life cycle are associated with the non-productive persistence. Despite the enormous technical challenges on studying persistent infection, our comprehensive biophysical, biochemical and EM analyses have identified a potentially key defect in the virus life cycle, which may contribute to the lack of viral infectivity. We found that viral genomic RNAs continuously replicate, that subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed, and that viral structural proteins are expressed in persistently infected N20.1 cells. Successful continuation of these processes likely contributes to the maintenance of viral persistence. However, we also found that while viral particles are assembled in the persistently infected cells (Fig. 6, Fig. 7), these virions are not infectious upon infection of susceptible DBT cells (data not shown), although continuous blind passage of “infected” DBT cells has not been carried out. The most likely reason for a lack of infectivity of these virions is deficiency in incorporation of viral spike protein into the viral envelope, since spike protein is the key determinant for coronavirus infectivity. This is evidenced with the EM examination, which shows that virions isolated from persistently infected cells scarcely have spikes protruding from virion surface. Although the spike sometimes can get lost following the purification procedures, the overwhelming presence of spikes in virions isolated from acutely infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells, which have been subjected to the same purification procedures in parallel experiments, suggests that the deficiency in spike incorporation into persistent viral particles is not simply caused by technicality; rather it is more likely due to some kind of defects in virion assembly. However, since virions from acutely infected N20.1 cells are infectious and have abundant spikes (Fig. 7, d–e), this finding suggests that defective incorporation of spike protein may have occurred following the establishment of persistent infection.DiscussionWhat caused defective incorporation of spike protein? Since there are no apparent mutations in virion envelope proteins (Fig. 8) associated with S incorporation (de Haan et al., 1999, de Haan and Rottier, 2007), we hypothesize that some cellular factors that are triggered by MHV infection and persistence might in turn inhibit spike protein incorporation into virions. It has been reported that treatment of cells with type I interferon (IFN) significantly inhibited the glycosylation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein, the incorporation of G protein into virions and the virus infectivity (Maheshwari et al., 1980a, Maheshwari et al., 1980b, Jay et al., 1983). It has also been shown that inhibition of glycosylation of MHV S protein by the drug tunicamycin led to retention of unglycosylated S protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), prevented S protein from incorporation into virions and resulted in production of spikeless virions and loss of viral infectivity (Holmes et al., 1981, Rottier et al., 1981). Similarly, infection with two temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 resulted in lack of the mature Golgi form and oligomerization of S, retention of the S in the ER, and lack of S in purified virions produced at the non-permissive temperature (Luytjes et al., 1997). A mutant isolated from DBT cells persistently infected with MHV-JHM strain exhibited slightly lower buoyant density and had fewer spikes; although the mutant replicated slower (small plaque mutant), it was nevertheless infectious (Makino et al. 1983). Interestingly, type I IFN is induced in N20.1 cells by MHV infection and pretreatment of N20.1 cells with IFNs inhibited MHV infectivity (Li et al., 2010). Coincidently, there is apparent deficiency of a higher molecular weight (possibly glycosylated) S protein from IFN-producing, persistent N20.1 cells as compared to that from IFN-nonproducing 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6C). Thus, we speculate that, like VSV G protein, IFNs and possibly other cellular factors that are induced by MHV infection in N20.1 cells subsequently inhibit virus infectivity by blocking the incorporation of S protein into virions during assembly. Such a possibility is currently under intense investigation.Cells and virus ::: Materials and methodsThe N20.1 cell is a cell line clone derived from mouse primary cultures of oligodendrocyte conditionally immortalized by transformation with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the simian virus 40 large-T antigen (Verity et al., 1993). It was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Compadre (University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine). The N20.1 cell represents a mature oligodendrocyte because it expresses the myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), but one that is at a very early stage of maturity based on the expression of the MBP and PLP alternatively spliced mRNA population (Verity et al., 1993). In addition, the N20.1 cell can be recognized by the A2B5 antibody, which recognizes a surface galactolipid expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; the A007 antibody, which is specific for sulfatide and found on cells committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage as well as mature oligodendrocytes, and the anti-GC antibody, which recognizes the protein expressed specifically by mature oligodendrocytes (Verity et al., 1993). The N20.1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and G418 (100 μg/ml) at the permissive temperature of 34 °C. Cells were grown either in T25 flasks or Petri dishes. The mouse oligodendroglial precursor cell line Oligo-neu was kindly provided by Dr. Patricia Wight (UAMS) with permission from Dr. Jacalyn Trotter (University of Heidelberg, Germany). Mouse fibroblast 17Cl-1 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Susan Baker, Loyola University of Chicago Medical Center) were cultured in DMEM. Mouse astrocytoma DBT cells were cultured in Eagle minimal essential medium (EMEM) and were used for virus propagation and plaque assay as described previously (Liu et al., 2003). The recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59/GFP expresses the green fluorescence protein (GFP) that replaced the viral nonstructural protein 4 (NS4) (kindly provided by Dr. Susan Weiss, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). The virus was propagated in DBT cells or 17Cl-1 cells.Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) ::: Materials and methodsFollowing infection of N20.1 cells with MHV-A59/GFP at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10, cells were observed for GFP expression, which began at around 12 h p.i. and increased with time. When strong GFP expression was observed (at ≈ 48 h p.i.), cells were trypsinized and prepared for FACS with the FACS ARIA (BD Bioscience) in the departmental flow cytometry core facility. Cells were sorted into fluorescence-positive and -negative groups, which were then re-seeded separately for further study.RNA isolation and conventional or real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) ::: Materials and methodsFor detection of viral RNAs in infected cells, intracellular total RNAs were isolated from N20.1 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy plus Mini kit (Cat.#74134) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen). The concentration of the RNA samples was determined with a spectrophotometer (Model U2001, Hitachi). For detection of viral genome and mRNAs, conventional RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (Liu and Zhang, 2005). The following primer pairs were used for detecting viral genomic RNA: The forward primer 5′1a (5′-TGT GCC GAG TGA TGA GAC GCA-3′) and reverse primer 3′1a (5′-GCC ACA TAA CCA CCT TGT GGA AGG A-3′) for detecting gene 1a at nt positions 3503–3742 (239 nt in length); 5′1b (5′-TGT GTA GGC ACA GGC TCC CAG T-3′) and 3′1b (5′-CGT GTT CAG CCA CAA CAC CGC-3′) for gene 1b at nt positions 1368–13891 (323 nt in length); 5′S1 (5′-GCT TGT GAA TTC AAA CGG TGC TAA TGT-3′) and 3′S1 (5′-TGC AGT TGC ACC TGA TGG CGT-3′) for S1 gene at nt positions 23997–24291 (294 nt in length); 5′S2 (5′-GCT GGG TGC TAT CCA GGA TGG GT-3′) and 3′S2 (5′-CGC GTG GTT TGG CTC TTA ACG C-3′) for S2 at nt positions 26868–27194 (326 nt in length); 5′N (5′-ATG GAA TCC TCA AGA AGA-3′) and 3′N (5′-CCT GAG GCA ATA CCG TGC-3′) for N gene (500 nt in length). The primer pairs: 5′Leader (5′-TTATAAGAG GATTGGCGTCCG-3′) and 3′S1, and 5′Leader and 3′N were used to amplify the S (400 nt) and N (576 nt) subgenomic mRNAs, respectively. In addition, the primer pair NF43 (5′-TCC TCT GTA AAC CGC GCT GGT AAT-3′) and NR370 (5′-GCA GTA ATT GCT TCT GCT GCC CAT-3′) was used for amplifying virion genomic RNA corresponding to the sequence (328 nt) within the N gene shown in Fig. 6. Primer pair 5′IG4 (5′-TTG ACT ATC ACA GCC TCT CC-3′, which is located upstream of gene 4 and starts at nt 27901) and 3′-G5a (5′-GGC ATG TGA GTG ATG CAT GG-3′, which is located within gene 5a at nt 28420) was used for amplifying gene 4 (GFP) from viral genomic RNA and primer pair 5′Leader and 3′G5a for subgenomic mRNA4 (GFP). The following primer pairs were used for amplifying the 3′-end of S gene, and the full-length of M and E genes, respectively: 5′Sc (5′-CTC GGC TTG AGG CTG TAG AAG C-3′, nt 27023) and 3′Sc (5′-ACA TGA GCC ACA ACC TGT GCA GC-3′, nt 27813); 5′M (5′-TGA GAC TGC CCC TAT TAG AGG TGG A-3′, nt 28923) and 3′M (5′-GAG GAG CTT CTG CCA CCG GC-3′, nt 29715); 5′E (5′-CGG CAG AAC TGT CCA ACA GGC C-3′, nt 28620) and 3′E (5′-TTG AAC TGC CTC GTG GGC CG-3′, nt 29030). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.RNA isolation and conventional or real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) ::: Materials and methodsFor qRT-PCR, 1 ng of the total RNA sample was used in RT reaction (25 μl) using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The reaction was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 9800 ThermoCycler in a 96-well plate for 5 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C and was then held at 4 °C. Real-time qPCR was carried out in 50 μl reaction mixture containing 1 μl RT product, 1× iQ SYBR Green Supermix PCR master mix and 100 nM primers using an iCycler IQ Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). The primer pair 5′qPCR (5′-TGC TTG GCT TTC ACA CTT TGT CCC-3′) and 3′qPCR (5′-ACC CAC TGG ATA CCA GGC TGA CAA-3′) amplifies a 172-nt fragment of the viral genomic RNA between nt 11402 and 11574. The PCR was performed in a 96-well optical plate at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 57° for 1 min. Results were analyzed using the iCycler IQ multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gene expression levels in various experimental groups were calculated after normalizing cycle thresholds against the housekeeping gene β-actin (using primer pair 5′b-actin: 5′-ACA GCT TTA CCA CCA CTG CTG AGA-3′ and 3′b-actin: 5′-AGG AAG ATG ATG CAG CAG TAG CCA-3′) and are presented as fold increase above the background from mock-infected cells. The threshold cycle (Ct) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. Relative gene expression values were determined using the 2− ΔΔCT method of Livak and Schmittgen (2001).Western blot analysis ::: Materials and methodsFor Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer (Cat.#9038, Cell Signaling Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentration was determined by using Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Equal amounts of total proteins were resolved by sodium deoxyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 7 h at 40 V in the transfer buffer. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% powdered skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris–Cl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The membranes were incubated with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with Pierce® ECL Western Blotting Substrate and detection system (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and exposed to X-ray film (Fuji). After the membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (10 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7) at 55 °C for 30 min, they were washed in TBST, blocked, and incubated with anti-β-actin mAb (as an internal control) at room temperature for 1 h. Detection of β-actin was carried out following incubation with the secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with HRP and ECL. The following antibodies were used in this study: A goat antibody against MHV-A59 spike protein (termed A04), a goat antibody specific to MHV E protein, and a mouse monoclonal antibody to MHV N protein, which were kindly provided by Drs. Kathryn Holmes (University of Colorado School of Medicine at Denver, CO), Julian Leibowitz (University of Texas A&M, Health Science Center at College Station, TX) and John Fleming (University of Wisconsin Medical Center at Madison, WI), respectively.Virus purification and buoyant density determination ::: Materials and methodsVirus preparation was purified from the cultured medium through a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation at 27,000 rpm at 4 °C for 4 h in the SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were further purified through 10–70% (w/v) sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C overnight in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The gradient was then fractionated into 12 fractions. The density of each fraction was determined with a refractometer and was further confirmed with the simple weight and volume determination, i.e. the weight of 100 μl of each fraction. The density was then plotted as gram per milliliter.Negative contrast electron microscopy ::: Materials and methodsNegative contrast electron microscopy was carried out as described previously (Zhang et al., 1994). Briefly, formvar-coated copper grids were floated for 15 min on drops of the concentrated virus suspension, dried by lightly touching with filter paper and washed 1–2 times in de-ionized water. Subsequently the grids were stained by floating for 1 min on drops of 1% phosphotungstate acid in PBS, and examined with a ZEISS EM10/CR electron microscope (EM) at 60–80 kV."
Silver Nanoparticle-Decorated Personal Protective Equipment for Inhibiting Human Coronavirus Infectivity,"The global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic is causing an enormous health threat in the world,"
The impact of long-term non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics and control,"COVID-19 is rapidly expanding across the globe and has the potential to overwhelm healthcare systems, killing hundreds of thousands to millions of people worldwide in the process. Without an effective vaccine or specific drug therapy, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, diagnostic and serological testing, and contact-tracing are the best available tools to slow the spread of the pandemic and to mitigate its health toll. Governments and other decision-makers have used models to predict the spread of COVID-19 and show the benefits of social distancing for “flattening the curve,” i.e., slowing the epidemic—reducing and delaying the peak—to prevent medical systems from becoming overwhelmed.IntroductionMany decision-makers internationally, nationally, and locally, have used models that are statistical curve-fits, such as the IHOME model2, to the observed numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths, without capturing the underlying epidemiological dynamics of transmission. While statistical models can be successful at describing near-term epidemic trajectories, they may fail to capture the high degree of uncertainty in the long-term epidemic process, and therefore should not be used to project far into the future3. More worryingly, these models cannot anticipate impacts of major shifts in policy, such as ending shelter-in-place orders and reopening businesses. Thus, policy informed by statistical curve-fitting models may fail to anticipate the potential for a resurgence of COVID-19 epidemics, and therefore will not be able to adequately inform exit strategies from shelter-in-place and other social distancing interventions.IntroductionEpidemiological models that directly model the transmission process almost universally predict that lifting interventions too soon will result in a devastating resurgence in the epidemic1, a phenomenon supported by historical evidence, including data from the 1918 flu pandemic4. Balancing the economic and social costs of shelter-in-place orders with those of resurgence events, all of which are overwhelmingly borne by the most vulnerable, make identifying safe and effective exit strategies an urgent priority. However, many currently available epidemiological models are not set up for other scientists or policymakers to conveniently explore a variety of exit strategies for specific locations to which the model is also fit.IntroductionWe developed an epidemiological compartment model of COVID-19 dynamics that uses a time-varying transmission parameter, β, to investigate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on epidemic dynamics and control. The model incorporates transmission from both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infectious people. By fitting the model to local epidemic dynamics (using daily reported COVID-19 deaths), we can estimate key epidemiological metrics and evaluate the effectiveness of different long-term intervention strategies. Specifically, we explore three classes of strategies: 1) long-term shelter-in-place orders, which we consider the most drastic approach; 2) widespread testing and isolation of symptomatic people paired with less intensive social distancing in the general population; 3) an adaptive triggering approach that ramps up or turns down levels of social distancing when hospitalizations reach critical thresholds. We are particularly interested in identifying intervention strategies that do not require long-term sheltering-in-place while still maintaining epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available.IntroductionThe goals of the model are to capture the transmission process accurately enough to understand qualitative impacts of intervention strategies without requiring extensive data on contact patterns, demography, movement, and other population features. We therefore model a homogeneous population with population-average parameters that reflect the demography of the population of interest. As a case study, we focus on Santa Clara County, California, where the first COVID-19 death in the U.S. was retroactively reported from February 6, 2020, and where the first-in-the-nation shelter-in-place order took effect early in the epidemic, on March 17, 2020. We estimate transmission rate for Santa Clara County under pre-intervention and shelter-in-place conditions, calculate reproduction numbers before and during interventions, explore the impact of long-term intervention strategies, and investigate counterfactuals to understand the impact of early intervention decisions. This case study illustrates how the model could be tailored to other locations to understand the impact of long-term interventions in COVID-19 epidemic dynamics.Model Structure ::: MethodsWe developed a compartmental model using an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) framework. We divided the population into states with respect to COVID-19: susceptible (S); exposed but not yet infectious (E); infectious and presymptomatic (IP), asymptomatic (IA), mildly symptomatic (IM), or severely symptomatic (IS); hospitalized cases that will recover (HR) or die (HD); recovered and immune (R); and dead (D), as shown in Equation sets S1–S2; Figure S1. Parameters are defined in Tables 1 and 2.Model Structure ::: MethodsBy including asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals, we are able to track ”silent spreaders” of the disease, both of which have been shown to contribute to COVID-19 transmission5. Tracking hospitalizations and deaths allows us to compare our simulations to data sources that should be more reliable than confirmed cases, particularly in the absence of widespread rapid testing and case detection. Mildly symptomatic cases are defined as those people that show symptoms but do not require hospitalization, while we assume that all severely symptomatic cases will eventually require hospitalization. We also assume that no onward transmission occurs from hospitalized individuals.Model Structure ::: MethodsThe transmission parameter, β, describes the average per capita rate of contact between susceptible and infectious people multiplied by the per-contact transmission probability; we allow this parameter to vary over time to represent different social distancing strategies (i.e., stronger social distancing decreases β by decreasing the per capita rate of infectious contacts).Fitting the Model ::: MethodsWe estimated both β0, which describes the initial value of β in the absence of any interventions, and σ, which describes the proportional reduction in β0 under shelter-in-place, where β = β0 · σ. To estimate β0 and σ, we assumed point estimates for some parameters (Table 1) and drew 200 sobol sequences across a range of plausible values for others (Table 2) to form 200 plausible parameter sets.Fitting the Model ::: MethodsUsing the pomp package21 (function mif2) in the R programming language22, we fit both parameters to daily deaths for each of the 200 parameter sets using six particle filtering runs with variation in starting values; each run used 100 iterations and 3000 particles.Fitting the Model ::: MethodsWe use COVID-19 death data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and local health agencies23. Daily deaths are calculated from differences in cumulative death reports. Using these data, which are available for all counties in the US, our model can be used to fit β0 and σ in any county. Location-specific variation in these parameters results from differences in social structures, population immunity, population density, and other factors that determine the number of potentially infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability. For a given location, our model assumes that the population is homogeneous with a single average value for each parameter.Fitting the Model ::: MethodsWe calculated R0 as estimated β0 times the duration of an average infection (as defined by our model structure) for each of the 200 parameter sets (using all six estimates from the mif2 iterations). We estimated RE on April 22 using the estimated β0, σ, and the median proportion of the population remaining susceptible across the 300 simulated epidemics.Simulating epidemics under interventions ::: MethodsOur modeling framework allows for different types, intensities, and durations of interventions, and thereby illustrates how these interventions impact dynamics and the resulting number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities through time. We consider three possible interventions that can be implemented at different times during the simulation:Social distancing for a set duration applied as a scaling of the transmission rate for all individualsIsolation of symptomatic individuals applied as a scaling of the transmission rate for only symptomatic individuals IS and IM; we assume isolation paired with partially relaxed social distancingAdaptive triggering applied as a tightening or relaxing of social distancing, triggered by hospitalizations crossing a defined thresholdSimulating epidemics under interventions ::: MethodsOther scenarios that can be modeled as a time-varying reduction in β0 can be explored using the code available on GitHub24.Simulating epidemics under interventions ::: MethodsTo visualize the dynamics of a single intervention scenario, we simulate 300 epidemics from the single best fit across the 200 parameter sets as defined by negative log likelihood. To quantify the effectiveness of each intervention scenario, we estimate summary statistics from the simulated epidemics, such as total deaths, for a range of parameters for each intervention (e.g., the effectiveness of infected isolation). For each scenario, we simulate 300 epidemics across each of the 200 parameter sets, and calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the summary statistic across all simulated epidemics. Here we define a 95% CI as an interval that captures the central 95% range of outcomes seen across all parameter sets and stochastic simulations. These are simultaneously wide because of large numbers of stochastic simulations, but narrow because we ignore uncertainty in all parameters listed in Table 1, and thus should be interpreted with caution.Local epidemic dynamics and control: Santa Clara County, California ::: ResultsWe fit the model to Santa Clara County, California where work-from-home, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders occurred early in the epidemic. We estimated that in the absence of controls, R0 was 2.88 (95% CI: 2·47 – 3·45) in Santa Clara County, and that under our estimated efficacy of current shelter-in-place orders, RE in Santa Clara as of April 22 is 0·98 (95% CI: 0·85 – 1·11) (Figure 1). We estimated R0 and RE over time by holding out recent data to understand how our ability to estimate RE evolved as the epidemic unfolded (Figure S2). From stochastic simulations with the fitted parameter sets, we further estimated the percent of Santa Clara County population that would have been in the recovered class on April 22 (Figure S3).Local epidemic dynamics and control: Santa Clara County, California ::: ResultsIf shelter in place is simply lifted on June 1, 2020, we estimate that a second peak is inevitable in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interventions, as illustrated here for one parameter set (Figure 2). Across all 200 parameter sets and stochastic epidemic simulations, we estimate a median of 5,478 deaths (95% CI: 1,767 – 11,632) and a peak number of concurrent infections of 171,667 (95% CI: 124,307 – 211,640) occurring on August 12 (95% CI: July 23 - September 9).Local epidemic dynamics and control: Santa Clara County, California ::: ResultsMaintaining shelter-in-place until June 1, followed by less stringent social distancing (50% of baseline contacts), combined with strong symptomatic case isolation (removing an additional 80% and 70% of invective contacts from severe and mild infections respectively), allows for higher background contact rates (e.g., more businesses reopening). For the parameter set shown, this scenario leads to an increase in mortality compared to maintaining shelter-in-place (Figure 2). Across a range of efficiencies of symptomatic case isolation in Santa Clara County, we find an overlap in CIs for deaths at all parameter sets but higher medians at the weakest levels of social distancing in the general population (Figure 3). For reference, the median number of estimated deaths under maintained shelter-in-place is shown by the horizontal black line, with 80% and 95% CI in dashed and dotted lines, respectively. These confidence intervals span a wide range because our estimated RE values range from 0·85 – 1·18, which leads to some epidemics growing and some declining through time.Local epidemic dynamics and control: Santa Clara County, California ::: ResultsIf widespread testing is not available before the end of shelter-in-place, a hypothetical alternative strategy is adaptive triggering, in which social distancing orders are intensified and relaxed as hospitalizations exceed and fall below critical thresholds. However, because the estimated RE for Santa Clara County is approximately one (and CI spans one), a strategy that periodically reduces the strength of social distancing may lead to an overall increase in cases that is not reversed when the current shelter-in-place is reinstated. In the advent of more stringent shelter-in-place (e.g., reducing infectious contacts to 0·20 of baseline, which is realistic in other settings), an adaptive triggering strategy that alternates between a social distancing strength of 0·20 and 0·50 could be effective in keeping hospitalizations low (Figure S4). This method keeps the epidemic within the capacity of the healthcare system, but results in prolonged cycles of epidemic resurgence and control that continue until herd immunity is reached through recovery of infected individuals or vaccination.Counterfactuals ::: ResultsSanta Clara County’s early shelter-in-place order (enacted on March 17, 2020) helped to keep the death toll low; we estimate that waiting even one additional week would have led to an additional 95 deaths (95% CI: 7 – 283) by April 22, 2020. (Figure 4, orange trajectories and histogram). Alternatively, the implementation of test-and-isolate starting on March 17, 2020 in addition to the shelter-in-place (assuming an additional proportional reduction in contacts for mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic infections by 0·3 and 0·2 respectively), would have helped to save an additional 24 lives (95% CI: 81 - [−1] (one extra death), green trajectories and histogram) (Figure 4).DiscussionLong-term interventions will be necessary to control the COVID-19 pandemic until more effective therapeutic drugs and vaccines are widely available: possibly 12–18 months from now, but potentially by the winter of 2020–2021. We found that social distancing orders such as work-from-home and shelter-in-place are effective at flattening the curve. However, lifting such measures even after periods of three to ten months or longer—depending on the strength of the intervention and the local transmission setting—risks allowing a major resurgence in the epidemic, undoing hard-won gains from social distancing measures. As an alternative to blanket shelter-in-place orders over long periods of time, we explored the efficacy of test-and-isolate and adaptive triggering methods for epidemic control. We found that test-and-isolate measures paired with lighter social distancing, especially when combined with early shelter-in-place orders, can be effective at keeping the epidemic under control while presumably alleviating some of the social and economic costs of shelter-in-place. Given the social and economic challenges of maintaining shelter-in-place for months at a time, test-and-isolate interventions are a potential alternative until better therapeutics become widely available. Improved testing coverage would also have the added benefit of: 1) improving implementation of contact tracing to identify and quarantine contacts before they potentially become asymptomatic and presymptomatic spreaders, and 2) helping to fit models and other public health surveillance tools to COVID-19 cases, rather than deaths.DiscussionRecent evidence suggests that a large proportion of infected people may be asymptomatic or presymptomatic25,26, and that a larger proportion of the population than previously understood may have already been infected (Stanford seroprevalence study:27; Harvard seroprevalence study:28). Our model currently estimates that 1.18% (95% CI: 0·01% - 4·65%) of the Santa Clara County population has already recovered from infection, as of April 22, 2020. A better general understanding of the total magnitude of the epidemic size, based on improved diagnostic and serological testing, will help to tailor estimates of epidemic trajectories under different intervention scenarios, and to improve estimates of epidemiological parameters likeR0.DiscussionThe model we present is deliberately simplified in several respects so that we are able to use it in different settings, explore a range of intervention scenarios, and to fit using death data. For example, the model ignores heterogeneity in susceptibility, contact rates, and disease outcomes arising from population demographic structure, co-morbidities, mobility, and other factors. Additionally, we did not take into account hospital capacity, meaning that lifting interventions could potentially lead to more deaths than predicted here if capacity is overwhelmed and mortality rates increase. However, with this simple model and accompanying open-access code24 and interactive tool (covid-measures.stanford.edu) as a baseline for exploring qualitative long-term intervention scenarios, we expect that researchers and public health experts could adapt the model based on further data availability or locally-specific goals, either by adding state variables or adjusting intervention scenarios and parameter values.DiscussionDespite its simplicity, the model captures the early dynamics of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County well (Figure 2), and provides estimates of R0 that broadly match other estimates in the literature29. The model clearly shows that early action in California, including work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders, saved lives. The qualitative effect of early social distancing on epidemic dynamics is robust to a wide range of parameter uncertainty; we estimated that waiting even one additional week to implement shelter-in-place would have led to an additional 7–283 deaths in the county by April 22, 2020. With the benefit of early action, some increase in social contact in the general public may be possible by June 1, given that the capacity for testing and isolation of symptomatic people continues to increase. Though we find that adaptive triggering is unlikely to work based on current conditions in Santa Clara County, it may be a viable option in locations such as Italy or India where legally-enforced lockdown has led to more stringent reductions in social contacts30. Expansion of diagnostic testing capacity is a top priority for long-term COVID-19 mitigation efforts because of its multifaceted benefits for concentrating social distancing efforts on those most at risk of transmitting COVID-19, for determining the true size and trajectory of epidemic dynamics, and for providing more certainty to individuals experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.DiscussionDuring an unfolding pandemic, modeling is an essential tool for tactical decision-making, strategic planning, and communication of qualitative scenarios to the public. The number of COVID-19 models has grown apace with the pandemic itself, and many of these models have overlapping goals and approaches; organizations such as the MIDAS Network (Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study) provide an important service in coordinating data-gathering and modeling efforts and in providing publicly available resources for the modeling community29. The rapid adoption of open-data policies from across the spectrum of academic, government, business, and media organizations has been a major boon to research and pandemic control efforts. At the same time, keeping up with the growing COVID-19 modeling literature is nearly impossible, and the differences among models remain confusing to the public amidst a fragmented pandemic response across US states, counties, and the federal government. While statistical curve-fitting models may be valuable for modeling short-term trajectories in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare capacities 2,3, epidemiological models that capture the underlying transmission dynamics are critical for evaluating the impact of major changes in policy over the long term. Epidemiological compartment models vary widely in how they subdivide populations and in the assumptions that govern movement among compartments. Individual-based, network, and meta-population models expand on compartmental models by capturing elements of individual and population heterogeneity that influence epidemic dynamics, but require much more extensive data for parameterization e.g., see1. Along the modeling continuum from statistical curve-fitting to compartmental models to individual-based, network, and meta-population models, compartmental models such as the one presented here are most useful for exploring long-term impacts of intervention scenarios across different settings where highly detailed data are not available.DiscussionWe aimed to provide an open-source modeling tool that is detailed enough to capture key elements of transmission, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission and a time-varying transmission coefficient, while remaining simple enough to be parameterized using widely available information and data. As demonstrated here, this relatively simple model captures key epidemiological dynamics and parameters in Santa Clara County, California, and suggests important qualitative differences among intervention scenarios. In settings where more detailed modeling tools and data are not readily available, this modeling approach can provide some guidance about qualitative impacts of different scenarios, and can be easily tailored to fit local epidemic dynamics. Most importantly, this model suggests that early interventions have already saved lives, and that exit strategies from shelter-in-place orders should be made thoughtfully and based on rigorous epidemiological models."
The COVID-19 Infodemic: A Quantitative Analysis Through Facebook,"Social media has become a crucial component of our everyday life in today’s globalizing society. It has a penetration of 40.9% of the entire world population, and it is estimated that, globally, 2.95 billion individuals are using social media as of 2019 [1]. Facebook has become the biggest social media platform universally since around 2.6 billion monthly active users were reported in the first few months of 2020, [2]. Therefore, social media, specifically Facebook, plays a significant and crucial role in the spread of information across the world, influencing the global response to this pandemic.IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome [3]. Recent evidence shows that the COVID-19 virus spread to human beings through transmission from wild animals that were illegally sold in the Huanan seafood market [3]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the COVID-19 virus is a new member of the Coronaviridae family but is separate from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3]. The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, dyspnea, sore throat, fatigue, and, most commonly, fever that occurs soon after exposure to a carrier. It may lead to pneumonia and severe disease as well, especially for the elderly [3].IntroductionIn this modern era, where technology is a click away, healthcare agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) [4] and the US Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] use social media as a platform to impart up-to-date information regarding COVID-19. Simultaneously, numerous rumors, misinformation, myths, and hoaxes have appeared on social media too, consequently drowning our credible sources of information, which have collectively received only some hundred thousand engagements [6]. Whether well-intentioned or malevolent in nature, this plethora of misinformation leads to a fear of an otherwise low-mortality infection; inappropriate prescribing and overdosage of harmful drugs, decreasing healthy behaviors, and promoting unfitting practices, hence resulting in suboptimal control of the COVID-19 crisis across the globe [7].IntroductionTo scrutinize the reliability of its content, Facebook uses the International Fact-Checking Network’s Code of Principles to choose fact-checking partners from all over the world [8]. When any data is considered incorrect, Facebook alerts users who have recently interacted with the said post and then reduces that post’s visibility to other Facebook users [9]. Despite these efforts, it was flooded with misinformation, forcing Facebook to announce updates and stricter policies in March 2020 [8].IntroductionKeeping this infodemic challenge in mind, our research aims to assess the utility of Facebook in providing misinformation, unverified information, and correct information regarding the coronavirus, concurrently testing the updated fact-check policy of Facebook.Materials and methodsWe conducted web-based research using the Facebook platform from July 14, 2020, to July 16, 2020. A newly created account was used to eliminate bias in the search results. We used the Facebook search bar using multiple keywords, as mentioned in Figure 1. Our search was restricted to posts in the English language only and to those having a minimum of 10 likes. We eliminated posts that had less than 10 likes Data of all the posts in the results of the searched hashtag were collected that included any information relating to coronavirus and were tabulated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Our research did not require the approval of the institutional review board (IRB) since all the data that we collected was from public accounts.Materials and methodsEach post was categorized as correct information, misinformation, or unverifiable information. They were cross-checked with the information provided by the updated guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4-5]. Those corresponding to the information were characterized as correct information. Posts that included any content that could be easily be rebutted using any of the aforementioned sites were considered misinformation while we categorized unverifiable information as posts that could not be proven either correct or incorrect by the same sources.Materials and methodsFor each individual post, a couple of predetermined variables were collected by the authors regarding their content and account characteristics. Accounts were categorized into the following categories: nongovernmental organization (NGO), government, news outlet, healthcare, and informal individual/group. Account verification was also charted. A verified account is defined as one of public interest that is deemed to be authentic by Facebook. The contents of each post were classified according to its tone and topic. The categorization of topics was health, financial, and sociopolitical. The tone of content was categorized into the following: serious, humorous, and opinion. Posts categorized as serious were those containing information related to COVID-19, posts labeled as opinion were those that portrayed the account's own point of view and humorous posts were those containing memes or jokes.Materials and methodsStatistical analysisMaterials and methodsDescriptive statics were taken to analyze Facebook accounts and post characteristics. Chi-square statistics were utilized to determine p-values for the relation between accounts/posts characteristics and the presence of misinformation, unverifiable information, and correct information. Bar graphs were created using Microsoft Office Word. Statistical importance was set priority at a p-value of 0.05. All analysis was executed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).ResultsAccounts and post characteristicsResultsOur study consists of a total of 454 Facebook posts. Most of them were posted by verified accounts (291, 44.5%), followed by informal individual/group (156, 23.9%). Of all the accounts, the least was posted from NGOs (30, 4.6%) and government accounts (12, 1.8%) (Table 1). In Table 2, we present the characteristics of the individual posts. The bulk of information regarding COVID-19 included serious content (264, 40.4%) while only 84 (12.8%) posts contain humorous content. The most common topic was medical/public health (287, 43.9%), followed by socio-political (96, 14.7%) and financial (68, 10.4%).ResultsMisinformation, correct, and unverifiable informationResultsIn total, 146 posts (22.3%) included misinformation, 128 (19.6%) included unverifiable information and 180 (27.5%) include correct information verified by WHO or CDC (Figure 2). Informal individual/group accounts had more misinformation when analyzed Facebook post by post category (65, 40.1%, p: <0.001) (Table 3). In addition, the same category posted the most unverified information (44, 27.2%). Government, NGOs, news outlets/journalists, and healthcare/public health accounts all had a low rate of misinformation respectively, shown in Table 3. Moreover, Facebook posts posted by verified Facebook accounts included more unverified information when compared to those posted by unverified accounts (unverified account: 26.4%, verified account: 29.2%, p: <0.001) vice versa for posts with false information where misinformation is posted more from unverified accounts than verified (unverified: 40.5%, verified: 27.5%). News outlet/journalist accounts (16.5%) contain the lowest rate of misinformation as compared to other accounts. Furthermore, public health accounts maintain the second-highest record of posting misinformation (51, 38.3%). The number of likes per post and the number of shares per post show no association, with any significant difference in terms of unverifiable and misinformation rates (p>0.05) (Table 3).ResultsAccounts with a higher number of shares and likes contain correct information (62.3%, 57.1%, respectively) demonstrating that more likes and shares are associated with correct information (p<0.01). Conclusively, the frequency of misinformation varied among hashtags, presenting that the hashtag ""#vaccinedevelopment"" had the highest rate of misinformation (Figure 3), the hashtag ""#vaccinedevelopment"" had the highest rate of unverifiable information, while ""mask cam"" and ""#coronavaccine"" had the lowest (Figure 4).DiscussionThe SARs-CoV2 virus emerged from the Hubei province in China in late 2019, but soon, the entire earth got inundated by this viral disease [10], resulting in numerous hospitalizations in the early months of 2020. Focusing on the devastating effects of the virus, WHO declared it a “global health emergency” [11-12]. Soon enough, social media got plagued with colossal amounts of information linked to the virus [13], as the public not only input content on social media but also used it as a means to seek health information and news from over the world. Posts ranged from individual preventive measures (e.g. the effectiveness of masks in containing the contagion [14] to treatment availability (e.g. reports on hydroxychloroquine [15]). This process enabled an explosion of unchecked information and the spread of misinformation. To our knowledge, our research is the first study that uses Facebook as a platform for analyzing the misinformation ratio.DiscussionIn our study, the total 454 posts on Facebook were posted by accounts owned by healthcare organizations 130 (19.9%), news outlets 114 (17.4%), NGOs 30 (4.6%), governments 12 (1.8%) as well as other informal individuals/groups accounts 156 (23.9%). They all played a massive part in posting information concerning different aspects of COVID-19 with informal individuals/groups (156; 23.9%) posting the highest content. Similar research pertaining to the coronavirus infodemic on Twitter tabulated their results as healthcare/public health 73 (10.8%), news outlets 111 (16.5%), business/NGO/government 37 (5.5%), medical/public health 468 (69.5%), and informal individual/group 448 (66.6%) posting the second-highest content. As serious as this infection is, most of the posts were serious in nature to 264 (40.4%). Coronavirus has not only affected our health but also the socio-political aspects of human lives; similarly, most of the topics of the posts were related to health 287 (43.9%) while some pertained to socio-political topics 96 (14.7%). Nonetheless, posts related to finance (68; 10.4%) also took part in disseminating information, as this virus has a negative impact on job security, resulting in a global economic recession and increased expenditure in terms of safety gadgets like masks, gloves, sanitizers, personal protective (PPE), etc. Conclusively, almost all types of content, whether serious 264 (40.4%), humorous 84 (12.8%), expressing opinion 99 (15.1%) - heath, sociopolitical, or financial-related topics - emerged on Facebook and are constantly being uploaded by accounts of different backgrounds. Similar COVID-19 infodemic data collected on Twitter [16] tabulated different topics and tones of Tweets as follows: serious Tweets (614; 91.2%), humorous or non-serious Tweets (41; 6.1%), opinion (144; 23.0%), public health Tweets (468; 69.5%), Tweets regarding finance (38; 5.6%), and sociopolitical tweets (242; 40.0%). This study also concluded medical health to be the most common topic discussed on Twitter.DiscussionSimilar to our study, people use Facebook to seek help and educate themselves, however, the “tsunami of information” holds an alarmingly high risk of misinformation and unverifiable information. Misinformation is defined as a “claim of fact that is currently false due to lack of scientific evidence"" [17]. Distribution of fallacious content across different social media has become a common practice and there is no exception for the COVID-19 crisis [18]. Finally, on February 15, 2020, the general director of WHO stated that “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic” [19]. Social media was the culprit of the dissemination of false news most notably during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign as well [20]. Another prominent example is the rise of numerous anti-vaccine campaigns when social media became the medium of propagation of inaccurate and harmful information [21]. This has happened over the years since social media and Facebook give the freedom to post any content whether it is verified by scientific evidence or not and the easy access to sharing Facebook posts disseminates such content like wildfire. Our results depict that misinformation and unverifiable information collectively is more than correct information on Facebook, hence verifying the former. Our results are also in line with Gunther Eysenbach’s information wedding cake model where Gunther et al. depict social media as the largest segment of the cake, representing the vast amount of nearly unfiltered and uncontrolled information contributed or amplified by the public [22].DiscussionSimilar circumstances occurred during the time of the Zika virus epidemic, misguidance, and false news spread. Neeraja et al. in their study stated that on Facebook, accurate information about the Zika virus and its disease was less popular than erroneous videos and posts [23].DiscussionThe fight against the infodemic is a real challenge, as it spreads very rapidly on social media. Tustin et al. and Xu et al. also reported widespread misinformation about side effects, as well as mistrust in government or pharmaceutical companies in discussions on vaccination [24]. False information over vaccines seems like an incessant trend. A COVID-19 vaccine is still under development, however, as our results interpret, fallacious content relating to it already exists on social media since the hashtag “vaccine development” was associated with a higher rate of misinformation (45.2%) and unverifiable information (28.7%). This suggests a continuous distrust of the public with vaccines, therefore, any future post regarding vaccines should be strictly under observation, whether pertaining to COVID-19 or not. Considering the aforementioned history, we predict that once the anti-COVID-19 vaccine is invented, it might have immense mistrust among the public, with hoaxes and myths spreading across social media, resulting in a large population of people not accepting the vaccine. If strong and clear-cut statements are not made exposing and condemning misinformation, it may have a devastating effect on the public [6]. The COVID-19 crisis already causes increased anxiety and has an unprecedented impact on mental health [25]. False information just adds more fright and unhealthier behaviors. For example, in March 2020, hundreds of Iranian citizens died after ingesting alcohol in a bid to treat COVID-19 as a result of misinformation circulating on social media [26].DiscussionResearch conducted on the spread of misinformation about Ebola during its epidemic concluded that the quantity of incorrect information was low; similarly, our data collected in the month of July portray that the presence of false and unverifiable information is less than correct information, yet they collectively exist in a significant amount versus correct information. These results are also parallel to those collected on Twitter during the month of February 2020 where misinformation and unverifiable information had a strong relationship with user account verification [27], as our sources of misinformation were also mostly from unverified accounts. Henceforth, Facebook should keep a stricter check on public unverified accounts, as they are a major source of distribution of unverifiable and misinformation.DiscussionVP Integrity of Facebook, Guy Rosen, in his updated letter on April 16, 2020, claims that Facebook removes or limits the spread of false information related to COVID-19 that could cause impending harm to the public. They either tag the content as false or remove it completely [28]. They have previously removed false information about rumors of the polio vaccine from Pakistan where it risked the ill-treatment of medical professionals [8]. Fortunately, in our study, the number of likes with correct information (38; 62.3%) and shares with correct information (36; 57.1%) were significantly more than likes with incorrect (6; 9.8%) or unverifiable information (17; 27.9%) and shares with incorrect (11; 17.5%) and unverifiable information (16; 25.4%), implying that the popularity of correct posts was more among users, as they received more engagement from the users. This could be the result of Facebook users not sharing content that was flagged as false or could entirely be because of the reduced visibility of erroneous content to the public. This is in contrast to Xinning et al., according to whom, people retweet jokes and sports events more regarding the Zika virus epidemic especially when those jokes and events include unverified information [23]. Another study’s findings pertaining to the information of vaccines on YouTube by Gabrielle et al. state that videos with positive and correct information were viewed and shared less and had fewer likes than those with a negative tone and material [19]. This may suggest a better content verifying system of Facebook as compared to not only Twitter but also YouTube, which are a couple of the most used social media platforms. Hence, it is safe to say that Facebook’s fact-check policy is succeeding in limiting the spread of false information as compares to other social media.DiscussionIn a population with a low literacy rate, health-related myths but the mostly increased availability of free time to the general public all over the world as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown may have contributed to the infodemic even more. Health literacy is defined as the individuals’ capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions and to address or solve a health-related problem. Reports show that a rumor has a three times greater chance to be shared on social media than a verified story. Lack of health literary and health myths, as well as free time, will only amplify the spread of such posts. There’s no ambiguity that it is tough and takes decades to tackle the problem of illiteracy in populations. Also, there is complete uncertainty of the uplifting of lockdowns in various parts of the world. However, it is easier to keep a check on the quality and quantity of information flow on social media, which will, no doubt, ease the panic and control harmful and unhealthy practices.DiscussionDespite our promising results showing trends in the inflow of information among Facebook users, our study has a few limitations. First, our study was limited to the English language, which may have generalized our results for non-English speakers. Second, the use of specific hashtags as search terms might have resulted in authors missing those posts that did contain COVID-19 information but didn’t utilize the hashtags while posting their content. However, we selected the most common hashtags, which were a total of 17 in number, greater than any keywords used in previous similar researches carried out on Facebook, and included all the posts resulting from those hashtags for three days [29]. Lastly, our search timeframe was restricted to a few days and, therefore, might not have captured the changing topics that might have advanced with the pandemic. This invites additional research to fill the vital information gap. Nevertheless, our research not only provides timely data but also proves the validity of Facebook’s promising fact-check policy.DiscussionAs recommended by Gunther Eysenbach’s fourth pillar of infodemic management [22], we also suggest that continuous monitoring and analysis of data and information flow patterns on social media should be undertaken so that outbreaks of misinformation, rumors, and falsehoods could be detected immediately and countered with facts or other interventions like flagging or removing the content from the social media platform, consequently decreasing the dissemination of negative information and panic among the public. Leticia et al. stated that limiting the spread of incorrect information by algorithmic and social corrections is also effective [20]. Content should not only be checked after it has been posted, but it should be verified before it is made visible to the public so that we could cut the cycle of the spread of misinformation before it starts. This should at least be applied over trending topics and posts getting larger engagements, likes, and shares. The quality of information, i.e. correct or incorrect, as well as the quantity and distribution in social media both, should be kept under check. Moreover, social media requires generating metrics not only of information supply but also of information demands, i.e. search queries and hashtags, for better control of any future infodemic.ConclusionsMisinformation and unverifiable information pertaining to the worldwide COVID-19 crisis is proliferating at a disturbing rate on social media. We quantified the misinformation spread and tested Facebook’s “fact-check policy.” Our research also provides an initiative for future researches to evaluate the accuracy of content being circulated on various other social media platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc., which are widely used by the general public, and study the impact of the propagation of rumors on behavior and precautionary habits that people need to adopt in times of public crises. Interventions from relevant authorities are crucial in order to harness the positive power of social media to distribute accurate and error-free information, as it affects herd behavior. Facebook’s fact-check policy is doing wonders; yet, there still exists a margin for improvement."

B and T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in health care professionals with and without previous COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented crisis and threat to our healthcare systems due to limited capacities of standard and intensive care facilities. This situation is tightened by capacity shortfalls in healthcare worker resources driven by SARS-CoV-2 infections, quarantine regulations, and emotional and physical exhaustion [15]. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently considered the most promising approach to face this global health threat.IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), is key to cell entry for the virus and thus, was the primary target of all currently approved vaccines in Europe [16]. In addition to the spike protein, coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode three other structural proteins, namely the envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, all of which evoke robust and detectable immune responses [17,18].IntroductionFor the aforementioned reasons, health care workers are among the prioritised groups in most national vaccination programs. Rapid immunisation of this highly exposed group is of decisive importance to reduce virus transmission in hospitals and nursing facilities [19], and to preserve crucial human resources [20]. The early timepoint of vaccination, the well-known serostatus due to regular testing and the fact that a high percentage of health care professionals have already experienced an infection with COVID-19 [15], renders this group an interesting population to study immunologic effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. By these means, academic supplementary programs paralleling the intended national vaccination programs may help to establish graduated vaccination recommendations particularly for people with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity [21]. As shown recently, most convalescents appear to have a protective humoral immune response for at least eight months [22], but various factors such as the viral load may influence quality and quantity of antibody formation [23].IntroductionTo date, research focuses largely on antibody titres and their ability to neutralise virus particles. However, besides the humoral immune response, viral infections including COVID-19 typically shape virus-specific T cells [24]. Such T cell responses are more laborious to quantify than antibody concentrations and are therefore rarely used as screening and surrogate tools for detecting pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Nonetheless, T cell immunity is at least equally important in maintaining efficient immunity to B cell-mediated humoral responses and data on the original coronavirus SARS-CoV indicate that antibody titres tend to wane faster than specific T cell memory [25].IntroductionIn this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of vaccine responses and side effects in health care professionals with and without previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to aquire new immunologic insights into both B cell and T cell immunity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.Study participants ::: MethodsIn this study, we compared the humoral and cellular immune response after routine application of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 from BioNTech/Pfizer in 41 staff members with (n=14) and without (n=27) a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pre-vaccination COVID-19 exposure status was determined by a combination of medical history and serological testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins before vaccination. All subjects classified as seropositive had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test in their medical history and showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in wildtype micro-neutralisation tests (MNT; Table 3). A detailed analysis of vaccine-related side effects after the second vaccine dose was carried out for all test subjects.Quantification of humoral SARS-CoV-2 immunity ::: MethodsAntibodies were analysed in serum samples at the day of the first vaccination (day 0), on the day of the second vaccination (day 21) and four weeks after complete immunisation (day 49) using an RBD enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and functionality and quality of antibodies were determined by two previously described micro neutralisation tests (MNT) [26,27].Anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ::: MethodsSARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein specific immunoglobulins were quantified using an anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) and an anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (both Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. All samples that were above the linear range at the recommended 1:101 dilution were further diluted 1:500 and 1:3000. According to the manufacturer's instructions ELISA antibody concentrations are reported in relative units (RU)/mL. Results in RU/mL correlate linearly with the first WHO international standard (NIBSC code: 20/136). Hence, sample values reported in RU/mL are convertible to international units (IU)/mL by multiplying with a factor of 3•2.Micro neutralisation assays ::: MethodsIn the SARS-CoV-2 micro neutralisation assay SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (nAb) titres were determined in human serum samples and serially diluted in 2-fold steps. Sample dilutions were mixed with virus stock at 103 tissue culture infectious doses 50% per millilitre (TCID50/mL) SARS-CoV-2 (strain BavPat1/2020, kindly provided by C. Drosten and V. Corman, Charité Berlin, Germany) and incubated for 150 minutes, before titration on Vero cells (Cat. no. 84113001, European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK) in 8-fold replicates per dilution. The virus-induced cytopathic effect was determined after 5-7 days of incubation. The reciprocal sample dilution resulting in 50% virus neutralisation (NT50) was determined using the Spearman-Kaerber formula, and the calculated neutralisation titre for 50% of the wells reported as 1:X. For further analyses, samples with a neutralisation titre below the detection limit were assigned a value of 0.5x the detection limit. The National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK) WHO International Standard 20/136, for which a potency in international units has recently been assigned [28], was included in the study and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs therefore reported in IU/mL. Testing was done using a fully ICH Q2R validated analytical method.Micro neutralisation assays ::: MethodsIn the vesicular stomatitis (VSV) micro neutralisation test (VSV-MNT) titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (nAb) were determined using a replication defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudo-typed with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, VSVΔG-GFP virus was produced on 293T cells stably expressing a C-terminally truncated version of SARS-CoV-2 spike (Wuhan isolate). Four-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were pre-incubated with virus for 1h at 37°C and subsequently used to infect 293T-ACE2 cells seeded one day earlier. Approximately 16h after infection, plates were analysed using an ImmunoSpot S5 analyser. The number of GFP-positive cells was counted. The last plasma dilution that resulted in a 50% reduction of GFP positive cells compared to virus only wells was considered as 50% neutralisation titre. Results are reported as endpoint titres and titres of ≤1:4 were considered as negative, titres of ≥1:16 as positive.Quantification of cellular SARS-CoV-2 immunity ::: MethodsThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells directed against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were assessed with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and flow cytometry four weeks after complete immunization (day 49). To specifically stimulate SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, lithium heparin whole blood or isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), were co-incubated with peptide pools (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) consisting of 15-mer peptides with 11 amino acids overlap covering the entire sequence of the spike glycoprotein (pepS) and the complete sequence of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (pepN).SARS-CoV-2 interferon gamma release assay ::: MethodsCellular SARS-CoV-2 immunity was quantitatively analysed by a whole blood spike interferon−γ release assay (IGRA) and nucleocapsid IGRA respectively. Therefore blood was drawn into lithium heparin tubes and aliquoted into four 600ml whole blood conditions. The first aliquot was incubated with a SARS CoV-2 S-peptide cocktail, the second with an N-peptide cocktail, (PepTivator SARS-CoV-2 ProtS, S1, S+ & N, Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The third aliquot served as a negative control and was stimulated with the carrier liquid of the peptide pool (H2O). The fourth aliquot served as a positive control and was activated with 4 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma, Missouri, US). After 24 hours on 37°C, the tubes were spun down at 2000 x g for 15 minutes and 200 µl aliquots were transferred into safelock tubes and stored at -80°C.SARS-CoV-2 interferon gamma release assay ::: MethodsConcentrations of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were measured using a human IFN-γ ELISA kit (BD OptEIA Set Human IFNg, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, New Jersey, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative control samples were diluted 1:5. SARS-CoV-2 peptide (pepS and pepN) co-incubated samples were diluted 1:5, 1:10, and 1:15. PHA stimulated samples were diluted 1:20 using dilution buffer.Intracellular flow cytometry of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells ::: MethodsTo decipher subsets of the T cell compartment, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells of seronegative (n=7) and seropositive (n=7) vaccine recipients were expanded and analysed by intracellular flow cytometry (ICFC).Intracellular flow cytometry of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells ::: MethodsFirst lithium heparin whole blood was collected and PBMCs were isolated using a Lymphoprep density gradient medium (Stemcell, Vancouver, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief 4 mL lithium heparin blood were diluted with 3 mL PBS, PBMCs were isolated by layering the 7mL on 4 mL Lymphoprep and subsequent density-gradient centrifugation for 30 minutes at 850 x g. PBMCs were collected from the interphase, washed twice, cryopreserved in heat- inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma, Missouri, US) supplemented with 10% dimethylsulfoxid (Sigma, Missouri, US) and stored in liquid nitrogen until further use.Intracellular flow cytometry of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells ::: MethodsTo expand SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells, 2 × 105 PBMCs in 200 µL of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS were pulsed with 0•6 μg/mL spike (pepS, pepS1 and pepS+) or nucleocapsid (pepN) peptide pools in the presence of 10 U/mL interleukine-2 (IL-2). Cells were cultured with IL-2 only served as a negative control. After 60 hours cells were restimulated with or without 1 μg/mL pepS or pepN peptide pools. Cells stimulated with 4 μg/mL PHA served as positive controls. After combined surface (CD45, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD69) and intracellular cytokine staining (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL17A, granzymeB) specific T cell responses were acquired on a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, California, US) and analysed with Flowjo v10.6 (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, US). Antibodies and the respective suppliers are depicted in Table 2 .Statistical analysis ::: MethodsAntibody concentrations and results obtained from IGRA are expressed as geometric means with 95% confidence interval (CI). After logarithmic transformation, differences in antibody concentrations between the seronegative and seropositive group and over the three time-points were analysed using a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random intercept for subjects and fixed effects for COVID-19 serostatus, sampling-time points, sex and the interaction between sex and COVID-19 serostatus. Differences between groups at each timepoint and antibody formation over time were further elucidated applying post hoc estimated marginal mean contrasts (R package: emmeans).Statistical analysis ::: MethodsCategorical variables were analysed using the chi-squared test. Both in IGRA and flow cytometry, spike and nucleocapsid reactivity were calculated by subtracting the untreated response from that of the stimulation and differences between groups were calculated using the t-test. Correlations were determined using Pearson correlation analysis. Differences with p-values <0•05 were considered to be statistically significant. Analysis was conducted using Prism V9 (Graphpad, San Diego, US) and R version 4.1.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Ethics ::: MethodsAll subjects received two vaccinations with BNT162b according to EMA approval. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Johannes Kepler University Linz (EC-No. 1322/2020) and informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.Role of the funding source ::: MethodsThe sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and the corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.ResultsDespite stringent hygiene regulations including continuous wearing of FFP2 masks, safe distances and hand hygiene, 14 out of 41 staff members of the department were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between November 2020 and January 2021. No severe courses of COVID-19 occurred (Table 3) ). The serologic immune status matched with the reported SARS-CoV-2 status in 100% of cases. Accordingly, vaccine recipients were stratified into a group without (n=27) and with prior infetion with SARS-CoV-2 (n=14). Notably there was a sex imbalance in our cohort with more females (16/27) in the naïve for COVID-19 group and more males (9/14) in the status after COVID-19 group. However, this gender imbalance showed no statistically measurable influence on the antibody concentrations (mixed effects linear regression model). Clinical and demographic characteristics of this cohort are shown in Table 3.ResultsAfter the second vaccination 18 out of 27 COVID-19 naïve participants experienced vaccination-associated symptoms, whereas 13 out of 14 individuals with recent COVID-19 reported side effects. These findings suggest that persons that have recovered from COVID-19 tend to experience more vaccination-related side effects (two-sided chi-squared test, p=0•142) (Table 3, appendix p3).ResultsAntibody titres represent the hallmark of vaccine-induced immunity. Thus, we first compared serological responses between COVID-19-naïve study participants and individuals with a recent history of COVID-19. On day 0, no antibodies were identified in naïve subjects while antibodies were present in all vaccine recipients who had previously been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4b, appendix p4). In vaccine recipients with a history of COVID-19, the first vaccination induced a marked antibody production resulting in eight to nine-fold higher geometric means than in COVID-19 naïve subjects (Table 4, Fig. 1b). In both groups, the second injection further augmented the formation of RBD-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, the antibody concentrations in convalescent subjects strongly exceeded those of COVID-19 naïve subjects (Table 4, Fig. 1b). Seroconversion was observed in 100% of subjects already on day 21 (Fig. 1b).ResultsTo provide additional information on the functionality and quality of vaccination-induced antibodies we conducted two types of SARS-CoV-2 micro-neutralisation tests (MNT). First, we performed MNT using wildtype SARS-CoV-2. At day 0, subjects naïve for COVID-19 had no neutralising potency, while subjects with a history of COVID-19 showed a geometric mean neutralisation potency of 236•9 IU/mL (Table 5). Interestingly, despite higher absolute spike specific IgG in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects after the first vaccine dose (Table 4), the neutralising potency remained lower at 82•0 IU/mL (Table 5, Fig. 1c, appendix p5). The neutralising potency of both groups increased after the first and second immunisation, yet subjects previously exposed to COVID-19 consistently showed higher titres at all timepoints (Fig. 1c). Over all timepoints there was a strong correlation between the results from the MNT and RBD-ELISA assays (pearson r=0•91, p<0•0001).ResultsSecondly, we complemented neutralisation assays using spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV). Results obtained from the VSV-MNT correlated well with both data from the SARS-CoV-2 wildtype MNT (pearson r=0•93, p<0•0001) and IgG concentrations determined by RBD-ELISA (pearson r=0•87, p<0•0001). Again, at day 0, subjects naïve for COVID-19 had no neutralising activity (neutralising titres [NT]: ≤1:4) while subjects with a history of COVID-19 showed an average NT of 1:64. This was comparable with the titres that were found in the naïve for COVID-19 group 21 days after the first mRNA injection. At the same time serum from subjects with prior COVID-19 neutralised at a dilution of 1:256 or higher. In both groups, neutralising activity continued to rise until four weeks after the second dose. Notably, the neutralising capacity of initially seronegative subjects remained below the titres of convalescents (Fig. 1d).ResultsNext, we examined cellular immunity and therefore carried out interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) utilising peptide pools that mapped the spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively. As the S protein, which contains the receptor binding domain, is the vaccine target of BNT162b2, co-incubation of lithium heparin blood with spike peptide pools (pepS) resulted in marked IFN-γ responses in all test subjects. Notably, vaccine recipients with a prior COVID-19 history showed significantly stronger IGRA reactivities (1117•0 [95% CI 836•5–1491•0] pg/mL) indicating the presence of more SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T cells compared to COVID-19 naïve vaccine recipients (620•6 [95% CI 460•2–836•9] pg/mL, t-test p<0•05; Fig. 2a). After the second vaccination, all test subjects demonstrated IFN-γ release upon pepS stimulation, whereas co-incubation with the nucleocapsid peptide pools (pepN) resulted almost exclusively in an IFN-γ release in subjects that had recovered from COVID-19 (1•1 [95% CI 0•3–4•0] pg/mL vs. 732•3 [95% CI 450•0–1192•0) pg/mL], t-test p<0•0001; Fig. 2a). Notably in subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection the magnitude of pepS-IGRA response was strongly correlated with the pepN-IGRA response (pearson, r=0•86; p<0•0001; appendix p6).ResultsTo investigate a potential interdependence between cellular and humoral immunity, we correlated the magnitude of peptide stimulation induced T cell activity with the concentrations of RBD specific IgG and neutralising antibodies (appendix p6). Although we did not find a correlation between absolute RBD-IgG and spike-specific T cells (rp=0•08; p=0•62), the magnitude of spike IGRA T cell response exposed to be significantly associated with the absolute neutralising potency measured by SARS-CoV-2 MNT (rp=0•38; p<0•05; appendix p6).ResultsIn COVID-19 naïve recipients, pepN stimulation did not lead to any reaction in most cases. Interestingly, four individuals showed a positive signal upon pepN stimulation, even though the seronegative COVID-19 status was confirmed by absence of RBD specific antibodies and negative COVID-19 history. To examine this unexpected pepN IGRA response, we also tested for nucleocapsid specific antibodies at all timepoints. Notably, only one patient exhibited borderline anti-nucleocapsid IgGs.ResultsTo substantiate the data derived from the IGRA assays we performed combined surface and intracellular flow cytometry (ICFC) on unstimulated, specifically stimulated (pepN or pepS) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated PBMC. During T cell expansion, co-incubation of cells with pepS, pepN and PHA resulted in the formation of cell aggregates, indicating cell activation and proliferation (Fig. 2b). While PHA stimulation, which leads to unspecific linking of T cell receptors, resulted in the formation of large cell aggregates, cell aggregates were smaller after pepS and pepN stimulation indicating the activation and proliferation of specific T cell clones. In line with the results from our IGRA assays, co-incubation with pepN resulted in the formation of T cell aggregates in subjects with previous COVID-19 only, while in the COVID-19 naïve group T cells were not affected by pepN (Fig. 2b).ResultsAfter stimulation and incubation, cells were fixed and stained with a combination of surface lineage markers CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD8, cell activation markers CD45RO and CD69 and intracellular cytokines including IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-17A and granzyme B. Both CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were activated by pepS in all participants; subjects with a history of COVID-19 also responded to pepN (Fig. 2c). Coincubation with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides elicited IFN-γ+ TH1 and IL17A+ TH17 cells. Additionally, in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides resulted in an upregulation of intracellular granzyme B. Mathematical back calculations of flow cytometry data suggested that four weeks after the 2nd vaccination between 0•07% and 6•7% of all T cells were specific for peptides of the spike protein. Again, the amount of intracellular cytokines of nucleocapsid treated cells from seronegative donors did not differ from mock treated cells.DiscussionHere, we report new insights into our understanding of how vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 elicits immune memory in subjects with and without prior COVID-19. For that purpose we examined the cellular and humoral immune status before, in between and after immunisation with two doses of the BNT162b mRNA vaccine in a cohort of 41 health care professionals, of which 14 had pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2.DiscussionAchieving a high vaccination coverage represents the most promising strategy against the current COVID-19 pandemic. In many countries the amount of supplied vaccine represents the most critical bottleneck to achieve this goal. To make the best possible use of the scarce vaccine supply, Krammer et al. suggested that one vaccine dose might be sufficient to induce adequate antibody titres in individuals with a prior history of COVID-19 [1]. In line with these findings, our ELISA results show that after a single vaccine dose antibody concentrations of convalescents exceeded those of COVID-19 naïve subjects by far. In the majority of cases after one vaccine dose RBD specific immunoglobulin G of convalescents even outnumbered those of naïve vaccine recipients after full immunization with two mRNA injections. Intriguingly, antibody concentrations induced by vaccination were 10-fold higher than titres induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This translated into an enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralising potency in convalescents in the microneutralisation tests (MNT) which was evident at all observation time points. Neutralising activity increased after vaccination in naïve vaccine recipients, yet to achieve a neutralising potency comparable to unvaccinated convalescents required full immunisation with two vaccine doses. At the end of our observation period, the neutralising potency in naïve subjects was only one sixth of that of convalescent vaccine recipients.DiscussionOur data are consistent with MNT data reported from the pivotal BNT162b2 phase III trial. Here, unvaccinated convalescents had neutralisation titres (NT) of 1:94 compared to an NT of 1:360 in naïve individuals following full vaccination [29]. Notably, this three-to-four-fold increase corresponds with our data where vaccination of naïve subjects resulted in a neutralising potency approximately threefold higher than in unvaccinated post-COVID-19 individuals. Due to the lack of an international standard at the time of the BNT162b2 phase III vaccine report, Pfizer-BioNTech was unable to report their neutralisation data in international units [29]. Here, we are the first to report MNT results post BNT162b2 vaccination in IU/mL and thus facilitating assay to assay comparisons for future studies. Using neutralisation data from 438 convalescents previously reported by us [26], we were able to further validate and confirm our data on natural infection versus vaccine induced neutralising potential.DiscussionThe antigenic drift of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of several new escape variants, of which the delta variant appears to be probably the most worrisome at present [29]. Many of these spike mutations result in resistance to neutralisation by antibodies [30]. An accumulation of such mutations is moving the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a direction that could ultimately lead to further new variants escaping current prophylactic measures targeting the viral spike protein. Unbridled spread of the virus could eventually lead to further accumulation of critical mutations, with the ultimate consequence that we are constantly chasing new variants. Such considerations require that we best contain viral transmission and achieve an adequate immunity in the population. Reported cases of reinfection and infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prompted comments advocating the need for an additional third booster dose for COVID-19 naïve vaccine recipients. Since in vitro neutralisation seems to be the best surrogate for immune protection [31], from our data it is plausible that one vaccine dose sufficiently induces protection in persons with prior COVID-19. It is still a remaining question how long this protection will last. Our findings emphasise the need for further studies to determine if, and if so, when people with a history of COVID-19 need another booster dose.DiscussionBesides antibody response, viral infections and vaccines also elicit virus-specific T cell response [32]. A recent study detected long lasting memory T cell immunity specific for the original SARS-CoV, even 17 years after the initial infection. Notably, these SARS-CoV-specific T cells were almost exclusively directed against the N protein [24]. This prompted us to expand our studies with assays for cellular immunity. This is often accomplished by methods such as flow cytometry or ELISPOT requiring isolation and expansion of primary immune cells [8], arguably distorting the in vivo situation and limiting the diagnostic value of cellular immunity. To overcome these problems, we established a standardised IGRA for the spike and the nucleocapsid proteins with a pre-defined incubation time. In accordance with the serostatus, pre-existing immunity was associated with increased cytokine concentrations in the pepS IGRA. These findings correspond well with the data recently published by Prendecki et al., who reported results from an spike ELIspot assay in which convalescent vaccine recipients demonstrated increased numbers of spot forming units after a single dose of BNT162b2 [13].DiscussionIn the pepN IGRA all convalescent vaccine recipients displayed high IFN-γ concentrations. Although nucleocapsid specific T cells were not boosted by vaccination against the spike protein, in subjects with a history of COVID-19, pepN stimulation elicited a similar IFN-γ response as the pepS IGRA, indicating comparable numbers of nucleocapsid and spike specific T cells.DiscussionThese findings suggest the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a potent T-cell stimulus and warrants further research towards the development of an additional vaccination target. This is of particular importance as mounting evidence indicates that the spike protein is prone to immune escape as demonstrated in the South African virus variant B.1.351 or 501Y.V2 [33,34]. In contrast, the nucleocapsid gene appears more conserved and stable – another reason for considering the N protein, in addition to spike-related sequences, a promising future vaccine target [35,36]. The concept of adapting vaccines to stimulate T cells more effectively appears particularly interesting as two recent studies provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals typically generate T cells that target at least 15-20 different fragments of intracellular and surface coronavirus proteins and mostly do not target regions that were mutated in two recently discovered mutants [37,38]. In contrast to antibodies, which theoretically induce a “sterilising immunity” by blocking epitopes within the RBD [39]. T cell immunity arguably becomes relevant during the early infection, helping to contain coronaviruses leading to milder disease courses and to reduce the risk of contagion.DiscussionNoteworthy, the PepN IGRA identified three COVID-19-naïve vaccine recipients with nucleocapsid-reactive T cells. These individuals had no relevant antibody concentrations against both spike and nucleocapsid proteins. We favour two models that might explain these results. First, these pepN IGRA responses might represent a cross-reaction with one of the other six human pathogenic coronaviruses, most likely one of the four endemic common cold coronaviruses [40]. Second, as all subjects were in close contact to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at their workplace, it seems conceivable that exposure to very low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 is insufficient to induce B cell response and symptomatic COVID-19, yet to elicit T cell memory.DiscussionUsing flow cytometry, we showed that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine not only induced a TH1-IFN-γ immune response but also triggered a TH17-IL17A immune response. The comparably small sample size used for the flow cytometry studies prevented us from dissecting differences in cytokine patterns between pepS and pepN stimulated cells. Arguably, our data support a concept where MHC-mediated presentation of virus peptides triggers antiviral TH1 and TH17 immune responses irrespective of the underlying peptides [41].DiscussionWe provide new and detailed evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 serostatus strongly modulates vaccine immunology. Our data corroborate recent findings suggesting that already a single mRNA-based vaccine injection induces a robust immune response in convalescents. We were able to quantitatively compare spike and nucleocapsid reactive T cells and highlight that the N protein represents a surprisingly potent T cell stimulant. New spike mutated virus variants render the highly conserved N protein as an additional vaccine target of interest.ContributorsARM, RH, HT, RK and AZ conceptualised and designed the study.

Clinical and molecular practice of European thoracic pathology laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. The past and the near future,"After the initial emergence of the infection in China in early 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spread to Europe in February 2020, first to Italy and then rapidly in March-April 2020 to all European countries, notably to Spain, France, Belgium and the United Kingdom.1, 2, 3 None of the countries of the European Union were spared infection, and as of March/May 2020, Europe was declared as the epicenter of the world pandemic.The contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and the uncertainty of human infection suddenly changed the functioning of hospitals and led to a new way of organizing the activity, as well as the setup of measures to protect the health of hospital workers.4, 5, 6, 7 In this context, the clinical and molecular pathology laboratories, notably those receiving specimens from the respiratory tract, were required to face up to the new constraints associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.. This study aimed to evaluate in Europe the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on pathology laboratories that have a strong activity in thoracic diseases for the period between 15 March and 31 May 2020. Attention was given to (i) changes to organization and the establishment of protective measures, (ii) the clinical, molecular and biobanking activities, (iii) the setting up of research projects in the field of COVID-19 and the continuity of training programs for residents and pathologists, (iv) the planned projects for improvement of the management of these laboratories following the first wave of infection, and (v) the number of staff members who were potentially infected or developed COVID-19.Study oversight ::: Material and methodsOn behalf of the Pulmonary Pathology Working Group of the European Society of Pathology, a survey was sent to 71 pathologists, mainly experts in thoracic pathology, in several European countries .This survey contained questions focused globally on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organization and the activities of the pathology laboratories between 15 March and 31 May 2020 (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100024). The different parts of the survey included questions on: (i) the pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures, (ii) the clinical diagnostic activity in the area of thoracic cellular pathology, (iii) the molecular pathology applied to lung cancer samples, (iv) the collection of biospecimens for translational research purposes, (v) the development of research focused on COVID-19, (vi) the organization of the work time of staff members, (vii) the training and educational programs, (viii) the different measures considered following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, (ix) information on the SARS-CoV-2-infected or suspected-infected staff members (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100024). This study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, number NCT04476823. Moreover, the study complied with the law of January 1978 (78-17) relating to computing, data, and freedom known as ‘computing and freedoms’ and with rules 2016/679 of the European Parliament (of 25 May 2018) concerning the general data protection regulation (GDPR; MR004). The study was registered by the Nice University Hospital (R04-39) and filed on the Health Data Hub website (7 July 2020) (www.health-data-hub.fr/depot).Statistical analysis ::: Material and methodsAll the data were collected and entered into an Excel® file. Categorical data were determined as frequencies and percentages. Statistical comparisons were evaluated with the paired and unpaired chi-square or Fisher's exact tests when indicated. Quantitative data were determined as the mean, standard deviation, range, and quartile; the paired and unpaired Student's t or Wilcoxon tests were used to compare these data. All statistical analyses were two-sided and generated with R-3.5.1 software.Sample workflow from the clinical and surgical departments to the pathology department and procedures for handling biospecimens in the laboratory ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsThe COVID-19 status of patients for whom cytological, biopsy, or surgical specimens were taken was known before the handling of the samples by the staff of the pathology laboratory in 30/53 (56.6%), 29/53 (54.7%), and 39/53 (73.5%) cases, respectively (Figure 1). Thirty out of 53 (56.6%) laboratories did not have pneumatic tubes and received samples by hospital couriers (Figure 1). Among the 23/53 (43.3%) remaining laboratories, 3/23 (13%) stopped using pneumatic tubes and received the samples by hospital courier only. Samples were sent to the laboratories in a triple package (as recommended by international guidelines according to UN 3373 and P650 norms) in 20/53 (37.7%) cases and in usual packages in 33/53 (62.3%) of cases (Figure 1). Ten out of 53 (18.8%) laboratories were equipped with a class 2 biosafety cabinet (BSC-2) in the room for gross macroscopy, which required handling of fresh tissue and frozen sections (Figure 1). Forty-two out of 53 (79.2%) laboratories had a BSC-2 for cytological samples, notably for handling and processing of fresh body fluids such as broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples. The number of staff members allowed to work at the same time in the gross macroscopy room varied (from 2 to 16, median 2) or was not regulated by a consistent rule in 18/52 (34.6%) of cases.Personal protective equipment ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsWhen handling tissue and cytological samples, 24/53 (45.3%) and 29/53 (54.7%) of the personnel (pathologists and technicians) wore a surgical or filtering face piece class 2 (FFP2)/N95 mask, respectively. Thirty-one out of 53 laboratories (58.5%) used one pair of gloves while 22 (41.5%) used two pairs. Twenty out of 52 laboratories (38.5%) wore surgical caps and 10/51 (19.6%) used surgical overshoes. The use of other personal protective equipment (PPE) varied according to the institution.The clinical diagnostic activity of thoracic cellular pathology ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsThe number of histological, cytological, and surgical samples decreased significantly for the considered period of analysis from 2019 to 2020 but was variable according to the type of biospecimen (Figure 2). The most significant decrease was recorded for the intraoperative frozen sections (Figure 2). The decrease in the number of surgical interventions could explain, at least partially, the decrease in the thoracic pathology activity, whereas the incidence of severe lung cancer cases dramatically increased for the same studied period (Supplementary Figure S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100024). Additionally, the mean number of autopsies slightly decreased from a mean of 27.47 (2019) to a mean of 25.29 (2020) (Figure 2). Moreover, only 19/53 (35.8%) institutions carried out autopsies on COVID-19-positive patients. Nine out of these 19 laboratories (47.3%) had a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy room.Molecular pathology for lung cancer patients ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsSome molecular pathology analyses were maintained, in particular for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests (Figure 3). However, a significant decrease from 2019 to 2020 was noted for the number of liquid biopsies (median decrease, 30.19%), the NGS analysis for clinical trials (median decrease, 17.54%), specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests (median decrease, 14.06%), and the analyses using in situ fluorescent hybridization (median decrease, 10.84%) (Figure 3).Collection of biospecimens for translational research purposes ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsThe amount of biobanking of tumor tissues and liquid biopsies dropped from 2019 to 2020 (Figure 4). Only a few laboratories [3/53 (5.6%)] actively collected samples from COVID-19 patients (not shown). Twenty out of 53 (43.4%) pathology laboratories carried out or were associated with a research project into COVID-19. Overall, the activity of the 23 pathology laboratories led (to date) to 71 manuscripts accepted for publication (median 3, range 1-10) in the area of COVID-19.Organization of the staff members' work time ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsThe majority [47/53 (88.6%)] of pathology laboratories set up teleworking for at least one of the occupational categories, but mainly for the pathologists, the technicians, and the residents (Figure 5). The mean percentage of teleworking varied according to the occupational categories; notably, it was 28.3% (range, 0%-80%), 32.8% (range, 0%-80%), and 40.7% (range, 0%-100%), for the pathologists, the technicians, and the residents, respectively (Figure 5).Training programs ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsEducational programs for residents and junior pathologists were maintained in the majority of cases [38/53 (71.7%)] using webinars (24.5%), digital pathology training and/or virtual courses (20.7%), and other activities (73.6%).Different measures considered following the ‘first wave’ of the COVID-19 pandemic ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsThe survey included a free text entry field to add information on different strategies to be considered after the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis. The questions focused notably on improvement of biosafety, development of training, and the intent to develop specific research into COVID-19 (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100024). Globally, most of the laboratories considered improving their biosafety procedures [32/49 (65.3%)], and a few of them aimed to optimize the rooms for gross macroscopy, notably to set up a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) environment and maintain the PPE. Some laboratories [28/49 (57.1%)] claimed that they would develop virtual training, but without giving any detail. Finally, a few laboratories carried out or participated in translational research projects on COVID-19.Information into the SARS-CoV-2-infected or suspected-infected staff members ::: Pre-existing or new setups for biosafety procedures ::: ResultsOf the personnel, 218/3368 (6.4%) and 136/3368 (4.9%) had fever or associated symptoms, respectively, which were suggestive of COVID-19. It is noteworthy that among these staff members, there was a higher number of technicians (110) than pathologists (65). A positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained in 64/777 (8.2%) of the tested personnel and 182/3368 (5.4%) staff members were in quarantine. Those with COVID-19 (64/64) were strongly suspected of having been infected outside of the workplace (infection by a family member known to be SARS-CoV-2-positive). No infection at the work site was identified, neither due to an inter-individual nor due to sample/aerosol contamination. Of the personnel, 547/3368 (16.2%) had a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A positive serological test was declared for only 36/547 (6.6%) of staff members.DiscussionThis study showed that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in pathology laboratories in Europe were heterogeneous, notably for those in the field of thoracic pathology. Consequences concerned: (i) the biosafety measures and the introduction of changes to the organization of laboratory practices and (ii) the different activities including clinical and molecular pathology diagnoses as well as biobanking activities. This has been presented according to the different countries, cities, and institutions.DiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic has a strong impact on clinical and molecular pathology in oncology (Figure 6).9, 10, 11 Delays due to COVID-19 had dramatic changes on the number of underdiagnosed cancer cases and additional cancer deaths, as recently reported by two modelling studies in England. This is highlighted in the present study by a substantial decrease in the activity in Italy, France, Spain, and the UK, and to a lesser degree in some of the other countries. Though the level of decline was not reported in this study, it could be explained, at least partially, by a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients with a thoracic pathology (other than a COVID-19 associated disease) during this period. For example, some patients with lung cancer seemed to have avoided hospitalization out of fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or the care of these patients was delayed by the physicians. Moreover, some cancer patients were assumed not to be treated adequately due to extensive devotion of medical services to COVID-19 patients. In addition, in certain institutions, the staff members of pathology laboratories were reoriented to work in the emergency or other clinical departments to take part in the different activities against COVID-19 and to help take care of COVID-19-positive patients. A European decrease in the molecular pathology analyses for genomic alterations in lung cancer was noted during the studied period. This could be explained by the fact that molecular biology testing needed more staff members on-site and less social distancing between the personnel, which was mandatory in certain laboratories. Moreover, during the COVID-19 crisis, we assume that a minimum of molecular testing (such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement) have been carried out as mandatory for the standard of care. In addition, a lower number of patients being included in clinical trials also led to the exclusive use of automatic targeted sequencing systems. Moreover, in the laboratories performing liquid biopsies, the number of respective molecular analyses decreased, including the number of targeted sequencing tests.DiscussionSustaining clinical and molecular pathology during the COVID-19 pandemic, notably to perform the different diagnostic tests requested by the physicians for hospitalized lung cancer patients could be challenging in the pathology laboratories due to a possible reduced number of healthcare workers (HCWs). Thus, staff members may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 (notably after viral transmission among HCWs or from an external positive COVID-19 individual) and the staff members who came in contact with the infected HCW may be placed in quarantine. This could lead to reduced ability to perform critical steps of the molecular pathology analyses of cancer patients. In this context, to prevent the shutdown of clinical and molecular pathology, it is critical to adopt a strategy aimed at restricting the maximum number of personnel inside the laboratory, but also to keep a safe distance between operators. Hence technicians and medical staff should plan their daily routine based on the minimum number of individuals required for each room. Moreover, it is important to adopt as much as possible teleworking for all professional categories. Senior consultants, medical students, and residents should not be present in the laboratory during the COVID-19 crisis. The present study showed that, apart for some laboratories, most of them had a common strategy to reduce the number of personnel working at the same time in the same room, at least in the rooms dedicated to macroscopy and preparation of frozen sections with more than 80% of the laboratories having no more than two staff members working at the same time in these rooms. Moreover, teleworking was set up in most of the laboratories not only for the pathologists and the technicians but also for other professional categories.DiscussionWe tried to evaluate the number of HCWs in a large number of European pathology laboratories who may have been SARS-CoV-2 positive or had some suggestive clinical symptom(s) of COVID-19 including fever. Thus, even if a small number of staff members became infected, as confirmed by a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, more than 5% of the staff members showed a strong suspicion of COVID-19 as they had suggestive symptoms of this disease. Moreover, the impact of these different symptoms and results on the measures of quarantine was quite substantial since around 4%-6% of the staff members were required to stay at home due to a strong suspicion of COVID-19 or due to contact with another COVID-19-positive staff member. None of the cases of infection arose due to handling of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and for a few HCWs, infection outside the work place was quite certainly due to infection via family members. One major limitation of this study is that the staff members were not regularly tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and thus infection of HCWs due to contact with asymptomatic subjects in the laboratory could not be ruled out.DiscussionIt is noteworthy that despite the rapid introduction of international guidelines concerning the laboratory biosafety guidance relative to COVID-19. the different protective measures for pathology laboratory HCWs were implemented in a variable fashion by the laboratories who participated in this study. One explanation for this could be a lack of understanding and some uncertainties of the contagiousness of the human samples handled in the pathology laboratory in the COVID-19 context.18, 19, 20, 21 The risk of infection of HCWs in the pathology laboratory is certainly much lower than in clinical departments (emergency and intensive care/reanimation units, pulmonology and other departments), and possibly in virology laboratories, although the actual risk remains to be determined. The main risk in a pathology laboratory probably comes from transmission among HCWs due to the non-compliance of social distancing in the laboratory space.24 At least in theory, the level of contagiousness of human samples is certainly variable depending on the nature and condition of the material (fresh, frozen or fixed samples), yet until now no case of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported due to sample handling in a pathology laboratory.25, 26, 27 However, specific measures need to be put in place to handle fresh thoracic tissue specimens, notably during procedures using frozen sections and non-fixed cytological samples (such as BAL, pleural effusions, bronchial aspirates, fine needle aspirate material) and processing and storage of frozen specimens. Thus, in the present study, it was noteworthy that most of the laboratories did not have a BSC-2 in the room for macroscopic analysis for handling of fresh tissue specimens and preparing frozen sections. Most of these pathology laboratories were only equipped with chemical hoods or with aspiration tables for gross macroscopy. Additionally, almost half of the HCWs working with fresh tissue specimens wore a surgical mask only and not an FFP2/NP95 protective system. The use of other PPE (goggles, face shields, surgical caps, etc.) varied from one laboratory to another. International guidelines have recommended abandoning the use of pneumatic tubes for tissue and cytological sample transportation, which has become mandatory for samples from COVID-19-positive patients However, only 13% (3/23) of the pathology laboratories involved in this study stopped using pneumatic tubes for sample transportation. It was not clear if the remaining 20 laboratories knew the COVID-19 status of patients from whom samples were received through pneumatic tubes. Interestingly, the COVID-19 status of the patients' samples (fixed and/or fresh tissue and cytological samples) by the HCWs who handled samples was known in only around 50% of the laboratories. Thus, the biosafety measures and biospecimen handling need to be increased, adapted to the latest scientific data, and standardized and implemented (re-iterative cycle). These measures are required anyhow when handling fresh frozen tissue and unfixed liquid/cytological specimens in pathology laboratories to prevent infection by pathogens certainly more contagious for HCWs than SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. mycobacteria, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, etc.). It is necessary to take into consideration that these procedures are associated with increased costs for the laboratories.DiscussionOne of the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis was the absolute necessity to develop virtual educational programs, notably for residents and junior pathologists (digital pathology training, virtual courses, webinars, etc.).28, 29, 30 However, the results of the present survey showed that only around 25% of the laboratories set up these programs, highlighting the urgent need to become aware of the utility of these different tools. In addition, some information, in particular concerning the biosafety procedures to follow in a pathology laboratory should be established through virtual training, and this was the case in the present study for no more than 25% of the laboratories.DiscussionOne of the more important negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in the biobanking field for translational research purposes, notably for the collection of samples from lung cancer patients (Figure 6) Biobanking in the field of thoracic pathology decreased substantially or was shut down in most of the pathology laboratories participating in this survey. Biobanking has been extremely important to provide material to solve the COVID-19 pathogenesis and a seminal contribution of pathology. Thus, pathologists should be strengthened to assure the continuity of the COVID-19 biobanking.33 Conversely, a number of the pathology laboratories included in the present work had the possibility to participate in and/or lead research projects into COVID-19.33, 34, 35, 36, 37 Thus, at the time of submission of this study, 71 manuscripts were published or submitted for publication in association with one or several of these pathology laboratories, which was a fruitful consequence occurring in only a short period of time.DiscussionOur study has a couple of limitations. Not all European countries were included. There is heterogeneity between the laboratories located in different countries, mostly with regard to the molecular pathology activity and the caseload (academic versus community hospitals). Because the survey herein was designed to address the measures taken from 15 March to 31 May 2020, the results of the current study might not apply to the later periods of the pandemic. Finally, it would be of interest to see if the different COVID-19 incidences according to the countries participating in this survey have a different impact on the pathology laboratories' activity.38 However, it was difficult to have regional incidence data inside each country (e.g. north versus south) given the scattered nature of the laboratories.DiscussionWhile Europe was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic between February and May 2020, subsequently, the number of infected patients who were hospitalized decreased progressively. Thus, at the time of submission of this study, the aim was to sustain and/or to reinforce the different protective measures so far implemented, at least partially. Some of these procedures are costly, constrain the activity of HCWs, and modify the organization of the daily practice of the pathology laboratories. In this regard, the following questions may be asked: (i) is it possible to again use pneumatic tubes for sample transportation, (ii) can pathologists again use multi-head microscopes for collective observation of slides, (iii) should all the HCWs keep wearing masks when working in all the sectors of the laboratory, (iv) should teleworking become permanently established as a way of working, irrespective of the professional category, (v) is it now mandatory to use a BSC-2 for gross macroscopy of fresh tissue samples and frozen sections, in association with a chemical hood with a HEPA filter for handling formalin-fixed specimens, and (vi) is it always critical to know the COVID-19 status of patients before receiving tissue and cytological samples, notably fresh samples and before frozen section and/or biobanking procedures? The results of the present survey demonstrated that depending on the pathology laboratory participating in this study, the strategy to adopt still varied, despite the current international guidelines. Whatever the adopted strategy, the COVID-19 pandemic sparked the improvement of the biosafety procedures now in place in many European pathology laboratories participating in this study and to the re-evaluation of the organization of the work. It is noteworthy that although many pathology laboratories were not optimally equipped, the rate of infection among HCWs was low and COVID-19-positive staff members were infected outside of the workplace. This highlights that major prevention measures such as wearing surgical or FFP2/N95 masks and adopting a safe distance between operators were certainly effective in containing/reducing infection between staff members. We strongly believe that most of the different actions that have been set up must now be sustained and that the pathology laboratories need to rapidly adapt their working day to change the organization, notably in the event of futures COVID-19 waves.40"
Exploratory Study on Application of MALDI-TOF-MS to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Saliva,"Since March 2020, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been considered a pandemic [1]. Its high rate of spread and infection in the human population and the lack of effective and validated treatment has led authorities in several countries to impose lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. To manage this health crisis, screening individuals is essential to isolate infected cases. These screening tests are mainly carried out using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of viral RNA [3]. NPSs are invasive and can cause discomfort from pain to nose bleeding for patients having a sensitive nose [4,5]. This discomfort could induce sneezing by patients, exposing healthcare workers to a significant contamination risk [6,7]. To avoid the constraints of NPS collection, others types of samples were proposed [8,9]. Among them, saliva appeared to be a relevant alternative and had the advantages of being minimally invasive and allowing self-collection [10]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the standardization of saliva collection with a Salivette® device improved the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to NPSs [11]. Although sensitive and specific, RT-qPCR tests remain relatively long (2–5 h) and expensive, and the strong international demand for molecular biology consumables are factors limiting the implementation of general screening and creating tensions in reagent procurement [12,13].1. IntroductionTo prevent the risks of screening shortage, an alternative strategy, PCR-free, based on the detection of specific protein signatures by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling has been proposed. MALDI-TOF MS profiling has been used for more than a decade in routine diagnostics by microbiology laboratories for the identification of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, yeasts and fungi) [14]. Its performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, speed, robustness, simplicity of sample preparation and low cost explain the rapid spread of this tool, which has revolutionized identification techniques in microbiology [15,16]. The principle of sample classification relies on the matching of query MS spectra against a library of reference MS spectra. This strategy of spectral matching was successfully applied for viral species identification [17,18].1. IntroductionA pioneering study reported the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS profiling approach to differentiate COVID-19-positive individuals from negative based on the analysis of MS spectra from NPSs [19]. Another work has shown that the combination of MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning (ML) analysis appears to be a suitable strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis using NPS specimens [20]. The application of this strategy to serum samples succeeded in classifying COVID-19 patients according to the severity of clinical symptoms [21]. Among the up-regulated plasma proteins, amyloid A1 and A2 proteins appeared as the best biomarker candidates [21,22]. These data revealed the potential of MALDI-TOF MS profiling for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using either blood puncture or NPS samples.1. IntroductionUntil now, no work had explored the potential of saliva for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using MALDI-TOF MS profiling. Recently, we established and standardized a protocol for the preparation of saliva samples for MALDI-TOF MS analysis [23]. This work revealed heterogeneity in saliva MS profiles between healthy individuals, which suggested the need for sophisticated bio-statistical analyses, such as ML approaches, to highlight saliva protein signature for COVID-19 diagnosis. In order to address the growing need for screening, the present study investigated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS profiling combined with ML approaches to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals applied to saliva MS spectra. Prior to the detection of potential biomarkers, a pipeline of quality control steps from the pre-processing stage was developed to filter out poor quality or non-conforming MS spectra (Figure 1). A set of statistical analyses and five ML approaches were performed on the MS spectra, in order to search for features in spectra distinguishing individuals molecularly diagnosed positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the ML approach with the best classification performance was applied to a kinetic saliva collection taken from the same individuals ten and thirty days after the primary collection. The corroboration of the classification prediction with the clinical results will be discussed.2.1. Ethical Statement ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ile de France 1 ethical committee (N°2020-A01249-30 protocol, 8 June 2020). Demographics, clinical data, and samples were collected uniquely after the understanding of the study protocol and consent acknowledgement by the participants. A questionnaire on the health status of each participant was carried out. All participant information and samples were anonymized before use. Sample handling was carried out under MSC-AdvantageTM class II biological safety cabinets (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Villebon sur Yvette, France).2.2. Individual Recruitment ::: 2. Materials and MethodsCOVID group. During the period from 23 July 2020 to 21 September 2020, outpatients consulting at the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) Méditerranée Infection (Marseille, France) and molecularly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NPSs within the last 5 days were invited to enroll in the research study. Saliva samples were collected on the day of patient inclusion (D0), and then ten (D10) and thirty (D30) days later. In parallel, a new NPS was performed for all participants to check their COVID-19 status on D0 and D10. Individuals under 18 years old, non-French-speaking, pregnant women, and individuals suffering of Gougerot-Sjögren Syndrome were excluded. Healthcare workers group. Healthcare workers without fever or respiratory symptoms potentially exposed to patients or patient samples with COVID-19 were invited to enroll in the study. A NPS was performed to all participants to establish their COVID-19 status the same day of saliva collection. Saliva collection was performed on the day of individual inclusion (D0) and then ten (D10) and thirty (D30) days later. Saliva from one healthcare worker (male, 46 years old) was aliquoted (20 µL per tubes), loaded onto each MS plate, and used as inter-plate control.2.3. NPS Management ::: 2. Materials and MethodsA standard protocol was used for NPSs collection using nasal swabs with viral transport medium (Pacific Laboratory Products, Blackburn, Australia). Routine diagnosis protocol was applied for SARS-CoV-2 detection on NPS samples by RT-qPCR [24,25]. The classification of individuals was realized according to molecular results of SARS-CoV-2 detection on NPS samples.2.4. Saliva Collection ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe optimized protocol for saliva sampling and treatment, previously described, was applied [23]. Briefly, a bottle of spring water was given to each participant who performed a mouthwash prior to saliva sampling. Saliva was collected using Neutral Salivette® (SARSTEDT, Numbrecht, Germany), under the supervision of a laboratory technician. The samples were stored in ice until their use. The storing time never exceeded 6 h. All Salivette® were centrifuged at 1500× g for 2 min at 4 °C and were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at 4 °C until their loading onto MS target plate. All samples were submitted to MS analysis the same day as saliva collection.2.5. Sample Loading ::: 2. Materials and MethodsTwenty microliters of saliva sample were mixed with one volume (i.e., 20 µL) of the mixed buffer (mixture (50/50) of 70% (v/v) formic acid and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France)) used for MALDI-TOF MS profiling analysis [26]. One microliter of the mixed saliva sample was spotted in quadruplicate onto a 96 polished steel MALDI target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Wissembourg, France). After air-drying, 1 µL of matrix solution composed of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 2.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, prepared with HPLC-grade water, was added. Matrix quality (i.e., absence of MS peaks due to matrix buffer impurities) and MALDI-TOF apparatus performance were controlled, respectively, by loading matrix solution in duplicate and saliva from the same healthy healthcare worker onto each MS plate. After air-drying at RT, the MS target plate was applied in the mass spectrometer.2.6. MALDI-TOF MS Parameters ::: 2. Materials and MethodsProtein mass profiles were obtained using a Microflex LT MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), with detection in the linear positive-ion mode at a laser frequency of 50 Hz within a mass range of 2–20 kDa. The setting parameters of the MALDI-TOF MS apparatus were identical to those previously used [27]. Briefly, the acceleration voltage was 20 kV, and the extraction delay time was 200 ns. Each spectrum corresponds to ions obtained from 240 laser shots performed in six regions of the same spot and automatically acquired using the AutoXecute of the Flex Control v.3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics).2.7. MS Spectra Preprocessing ::: 2. Materials and MethodsRaw data of MALDI-TOF MS spectra (Bruker Daltonics) were preprocessed using MALDIquant [28] and MALDIrppa [29] R packages. The MS spectra were then processed by applying a square root transformation, a smoothing using the Savitzki-Golay-Filter algorithm [30], baseline correction with the SNIP algorithm [31], and normalization of intensity values using the total-ion-current (TIC). All these transformations were performed through the MS processing functions (transformIntensity, smoothIntensity, removeBaseline, calibrateIntensity) of the MALDIquant package using the default parameters. To detect and filter out poor quality (or non-conforming) MS spectra, the screenSpectra function of the MALDIrppa package was used. It computed an atypicality score for each spectrum. All spectra with a score outside the limit were excluded from the rest of the analysis. Then the non-excluded spectra from replicates of the same sample were averaged (averageMassSpectra, MALDIquant package), giving an average spectrum for each sample. The intensity of each average spectrum was normalized by adjusting the TIC (calibrateIntensity, MALDIquant package). The alignment of peaks and spectra were performed with functions of the MALDIquant package. Peaks were detected by adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value and binned with a tolerance value of 0.001. To determine the optimal SNR value, the number of detected peaks and their standard deviation were measured for each SNR value tested. The SNR value for which the number of detected peaks per group was homogenized and stabilized was considered as the optimal trade-off. Only peaks with a frequency of occurrence greater than 50% per group were considered. At the end of the peak detection, the resulting matrix of peak intensities was used for statistical analyses and ML approaches.2.8. Statistical Analyses ::: 2. Materials and MethodsAfter verifying that the values in each group did not assume a Gaussian distribution, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were computed when appropriate with R. For multiple testing, a false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied using Benjamini–Hochberg correction [27]. The selection of MS peaks required a significant Wilcoxon rank sum test (p < 0.05) and a relevant Benjamini–Hochberg correction (p < 0.1).2.9. Dimension Reduction Algorithms ::: 2. Materials and MethodsPrincipal component analysis (PCA) [32] and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [33] were used to visualize data on a two-dimensional reduced space and to deduce the relations between spectra profiles of individuals. MS spectra from confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (n = 105) and control healthcare workers (n = 51) collected at D0 were used. Dimension reductions were carried out either on all peaks detected or on selected peaks. PCA was performed using the R FactoMineR [34] package. UMAP was computed using the umap R library [35].2.10. Machine Learning (ML) Analyses ::: 2. Materials and MethodsMS spectra from 102 saliva samples, including confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (n = 51) and control healthcare workers (n = 51) collected at D0, were selected to establish the best algorithm classifying SARS-CoV-2 positives from control samples. Five different algorithms, namely, support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-LK), support vector machine with radial basis function kernel (SVM-RK), random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were evaluated. ML models were implemented with the caret package [36], except for the SVM-RK, which was performed using the e1071 package [37]. Contrary to caret, the e1071 library provides an implementation of SVM-RK models with the gamma hyperparameter, which allows gamma to be tuned to improve the performance of models. The training process was conducted by a threefold nested repeated tenfold cross-validation to ensure an unbiased estimation of performance. The proportion of the training and test datasets were adjusted to 75% and 25%, respectively, to perform the repeated cross-validation. Model performances after the training step were estimated by computing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and average precision (AP) values. AUC and AP were computed on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves with the ROC R package [38].3.1. Characteristics of Participants ::: 3. ResultsA total of 360 saliva samples, obtained from 138 patients diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive (Cov+ group) and 51 healthcare workers considered as healthy control (Cov− group), were included in the study. For both groups, serial saliva sampling was performed ten (D10) and thirty (D30) days after the first saliva collection (Table 1). Among patients from the Cov+ group, the SARS-CoV-2-positive status was confirmed by NPS tests for 76.1% (105/138) of them at the enrollment day (D0). At D10, the virus was still detectable for 16 out of 79 (20.3%) patients from the Cov+ group. At D30, the 20 individuals from the Cov+ group were considered as exempt of infections based on the delay since primary infection and in the absence of any clinical symptoms in the ten days before saliva sampling. SARS-CoV-2 detection performed on NPS samples from healthcare workers (Cov− group) were all negative at the enrollment day (D0, n = 51) and ten days later (D10, n = 40) (Table 1). The absence of any clinical symptoms in the ten days before saliva sampling at D30 for the 32 individuals from the Cov− group were considered as exempt from infections. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in none of the individuals from Cov+ and Cov− groups molecularly tested on saliva at D30. No significant differences were noted for age (p = 0.069, Kruskal–Wallis test) or gender (p = 0.279, df = 5, Pearson’s Chi-square test) among the groups considering collection time points. It is interesting to note that all individuals from the Cov+ group were tested positively, outside our institute, less than one week before in order to be included in the study.3.2. Preprocessing Steps of Saliva MS Spectra ::: 3. ResultsPrior to researching the saliva protein signature distinguishing Cov+ from Cov− individuals, MS spectra were submitted to successive quality control steps. As each sample was loaded in quadruplicate, a total of 1440 MS spectra were obtained. The screenSpectra function (MALDIrppa package) assigned an atypicality score (score threshold > 0.9, Figure 2A) to 23 MS spectra (Cov+, n = 18; Cov−, n = 5). These spectra were rejected for the rest of the analysis. As no more than two replicate spectra were excluded for each sample, no saliva sample was removed after this step. After filtering atypical spectra and averaging spectra replicates, the comparison of the TIC between Cov+ (n = 237) and Cov− (n = 123) groups revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 2B), underlining a stable spectra acquisition throughout the study independently of the sample group origin.3.2. Preprocessing Steps of Saliva MS Spectra ::: 3. ResultsThe comparison of peak numbers detected according to the SNR value was performed to select the SNR value allowing for the inclusion of mainly true peaks and assessing peak detection between the Cov+ and Cov− groups. For SNR values lower than 4, the number of detected peaks was highly heterogeneous between the two groups and among the SNR values. Moreover, an important decrease in the number of detected peaks was noticed with the increment of SNR values (Figure 2C). Conversely, for SNR values of 4 and above, the mean number of detected peaks and its standard deviation diminished slowly (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the peak number distributions between the Cov+ and Cov− groups were not significantly different only for the SNR value equal to 4 (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 2D). Then, for the remainder of the analysis, a SNR value of 4 was selected and an intensity matrix of 212 peaks was obtained.3.3. Comparison of Saliva MS Spectra and Detection of Potential Biomarkers ::: 3. ResultsFor these analyses, unique saliva samples from Cov+ group confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive at D0 (n = 105) were compared to the Cov− group from D0 (n = 51). No visible difference was noticed when the mean spectra of the Cov+ (n = 105, Figure 3A) and the Cov− (n = 51, Figure 3B) groups were compared (Figure 3C), reflecting the complexity and the heterogeneity of spectra profiles. The application of a Wilcoxon rank sum test (p < 0.05) identified 52 peaks distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 positive from negative samples (Table S1). The correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Benjamini-Hochberg, p < 0.1) allowed nine peaks to be selected (Figure 3D). Among these peaks, seven and two exhibited higher intensity in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative groups, respectively (Figure 3E). The peaks with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 2489.2 and m/z of 5418.9 possessed the most significant intensity differences for the positive (Figure 3F) and negative (Figure 3G) groups, respectively. PCA analysis, carried out on these 9 selected peaks, allows a partial distinction between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative groups (Figure 3H). Carrying out a UMAP on these selected peaks does not improve the separation of groups (Figure 3I). When PCA and UMAP were performed using all peaks (Figure S1A,B) or the 52 peaks selected with two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test (Figure S1C,D), no clear separation could be noticed.3.4. Building and Selection of Machine Learning Models ::: 3. ResultsTo assess the performance of ML approaches to separate SARS-CoV-2-positive from negative individuals, samples were split into different groups. A first group was used during the building and training phase of the ML models, which allowed the selection of the best model. Then, during the test phase, the performance of the selected model was evaluated on independent groups. For building the training model, a balanced group of samples (51 Cov+, 51 Cov−) was formed from individuals at D0 (Figure 4). The 51 Cov+ samples were randomly selected from the 105 positive samples at D0 with a confirmed infection status. The remaining samples were organized into five test groups (Test 1 to Test 5), according to collection time points (D0, D10, and D30) and NPS RT-qPCR results (Figure 4). A total of 96 samples from Cov+ group were classified as uncertain negative for SARS-CoV-2, because all these individuals were diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive either in the week preceding their enrollment (n = 33 at D0) or ten days before this second NPS test (n = 66 at D10). Considering a SARS-CoV-2 false-negative, the detection rate can reach 30% [39], these 96 samples were classified as uncertain negatives and were tested separately (Test 5).3.4. Building and Selection of Machine Learning Models ::: 3. ResultsFive different ML models (K-NN, LDA, RF, SVM-LK and SVM-RK) were studied. The best ROC and PR curves obtained for each ML model are presented in Figure 5A and Figure 5B, respectively. With the exception of the K-NN model, the models exhibited high performance with the best area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 0.92 and 0.94 for ROC and PR curves, respectively. To select the model with the best compromise of sensitivity and specificity, the F1-score was computed (Figure 5C). The SVM-LK model obtained the best F1-score, about 0.85, achieving a sensibility of 85.1% and a specificity of 85.3%. The SVM-LK model reached the greatest average area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for ROC and 93 for PR curves, supporting the existence of a protein pattern associated with saliva mass spectra. The SVM-LK model was then applied to test groups to determine its prediction performance.3.5. Performance of the SVM-LK Model ::: 3. ResultsTo evaluate the performance of the SVM-LK model, all saliva MS spectra were included except those used for model training. The first test set (Test 1, n = 162), included MS spectra collected at D0, D10, and D30 from Cov+ (n = 90) and Cov− (n = 72) groups, with the exception of samples classified as uncertain negatives. Saliva samples collected at D30 from both groups (Cov+ and Cov−) were classified as SARS-CoV-2 negatives (n = 52). Then, among Test 1, 70, and 92, samples were classified as positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively, based on NPS RT-qPCR results (Figure 4). On the Test 1 set, the SVM-LK model distinguished SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative samples with accuracy, sensibility, and specificity of 77.8%, 78.6%, and 77.2%, respectively (Figure 6A,E). The model performance on this independent dataset was lower than those obtained during model training. Interestingly, among the 70 individuals classified as SARS-CoV-2 positives by NPSs from Test 1, 15 saliva samples were not confirmed by the SVM-LK model (Figure 6A). The comparison of viral loads revealed that the Ct values from the 55 samples (mean ± SD, range: 24.6 ± 5.8, 10.0–33.8) classified positives by both approaches, were significantly lower (p < 0.02, Mann–Whitney test) than those from 15 saliva samples (mean ± SD, range: 28.2 ± 6.2, 10.0–34.3) classified negatives by ML. These results support the hypothesis that samples with higher viral loads were better classified by SVM-LK model.3.5. Performance of the SVM-LK Model ::: 3. ResultsThe model, trained only on samples collected at D0, could be less efficient in classifying samples collected at D10 and D30. To assess this hypothesis, the SVM-LK model was applied to MS spectra from samples collected at D0 (Test 2, n = 54), D10 (Test 3, n = 56), and D30 (Test 4, n = 52) separately (Figure 6B, Figure 6C and Figure 6D). The proportions of correct classification were of 88.9% for Test 2, 64.3% for Test 3, and 80.8% for Test 4 (Figure 6E). Interestingly, higher performance was obtained for Test 2, which includes samples collected at D0 as those used to train the model. Finally, we applied the model to MS spectra from samples classified as uncertain negative samples (Test 5, n = 96). More than half of the samples (n = 54/96) remained predicted as SARS-CoV-2-positive samples (Figure 6F): two third (n = 22/33) at D0 and half (n = 32/63) at D10.4. DiscussionTo overcome the constraint of NPS sampling and the limitations of molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, the use of saliva specimens combined with the MALDI-TOF MS and ML approaches appeared as a promising alternative strategy. The present work described the application of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of a specific salivary protein pattern to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-positive from negative individuals. For this purpose, the entire analytical chain must be of high quality.4. DiscussionThe quality of spectra is directly linked to the mode of sample collection, storing, and preparation before submission to MS [40,41]. Although passive drooling is the most simple and common method for saliva collection, the use of specific devices, such as Salivette®, allows the specimen collection to be standardized [11,42]. Moreover, the saliva is composed of numerous enzymatic proteins that could alter MS spectra by auto-digestion of the sample [43]. To limit these phenomena, an optimized protocol for saliva collection and management applied for MS analyses has recently been established and was used in the present work [23]. Although this protocol enables excellent intra-individual reproducibility, the salivary profile between individuals is heterogeneous. This heterogeneity requires the acquisition of high-quality MS spectra to succeed in a correct classification. In this way, pre-processing steps evaluating MS spectra quality and their homogeneity between groups are crucial. They were carefully defined and performed in this work.4. DiscussionFiltering of atypical MS spectra with MALDIrppa package was performed on each replicate. The rejection of spectra was operated before averaging spectra per sample to prevent alteration of protein profiles. No significant difference in TIC distribution between the Cov+ and Cov− groups was determined, which ensured homogeneity of the spectra intensities. Quality control steps excluding outlier MS spectra improved the comparison of MS spectra. Although the filtering step is frequently used for the pre-processing of MS spectra [19], the TIC distribution is seldom considered. Despite TIC results being linked to the sample composition, important variations of TIC could occur between samples of the same type. These TIC variations generally reflect experimental or technical variations such as sample preparation (e.g., treatment or amount) and apparatus performances (e.g., laser power or detector sensitivity) [44,45], which could hamper the detection of pertinent biological information. The application of a normalization to TIC values allows all samples to be equalized.4. DiscussionThe establishment of peak detection threshold is another decisive parameter for the detection of biological markers [46]. Peak detection depends on the determination of the optimal SNR value. Applying an insufficiently strict SNR value increases the risk of including peaks corresponding to background noise, which could distort the statistical analysis and lead to an inappropriate interpretation of the results. Inversely, choosing too high an SNR value may lead to the miss-detection of true peaks, and this lack of information could be deleterious for further analysis steps. Here, the analysis of the number of peaks detected and its variation among samples according to the SNR value, allowed the selection of a threshold of 4. Indeed, for SNR values lower than 4, the high number of peaks detected and its high dispersion among samples were likely related to peaks detected in the background of spectra. Moreover, at an SNR of 4, we controlled that the number of peaks detected between the Cov+ and Cov− groups were comparable, limiting any bias in the analysis. The recent studies evaluating the performance of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate SARS-CoV-2-positive from negative individuals, using either NPS or serum samples, did not clearly detail the criteria for selecting the SNR value [19,21,47].4. DiscussionFor serum samples, the selection of an SNR value of 5 appeared sufficient to separate COVID-19 patients into three levels of severity by applying ML models [47]. Nevertheless, the stringency of peak detection might miss some specific peaks that could improve this classification. Conversely, Nachtigall et al. chose an SNR value of 2 for peak detection of NPS from individuals diagnosed as positive or not for COVID-19 [19]. Based on this SNR value, they determined seven significantly different peaks. These discriminant peaks had a very low intensity and could likely not be detected if a higher SNR value was selected. Generally, the SNR value is chosen to be high enough to prevent the detection of peaks in background noise. However, it is likely that too high an SNR value will filter out decisive peaks for classification. Therefore, establishing an accurate strategy to optimize the SNR value becomes compulsory to avoid miss- or over-detection of peaks. The application of these quality control steps should reduce the number of replicates from four to two per sample, allowing 48 samples to be tested in less than 2 h [14].4. DiscussionUsing an SNR value of 4 at the peak detection step, we obtained an intensity matrix of 212 peaks. Among them, nine peaks with a relevant different intensity distribution were identified between positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 and healthy individuals. A significantly higher intensity distribution for the Cov+ group compared to the Cov− group was observed for 7 of the 9 peaks. Natchigall et al. [19] reported in nasal swab samples that five of the seven peaks, distinguishing Cov+ and Cov− groups, have a higher intensity distribution in healthy individuals. Similarly, in another study using swab samples, all of the discriminant peaks possessed a higher intensity distribution for uninfected individuals than for SARS-CoV-2-contaminated patients [20]. Conversely, here in saliva samples, discriminant MS peaks correspond mainly to up-regulation protein expression subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection.4. DiscussionIn parallel to the differential analysis of peak intensity, none of the dimension reduction algorithms (i.e., PCA or UMAP) applied to the intensity matrix of the nine selected peaks were able to show a clear separation between SARS-CoV-2-infected and healthy individuals. Similar observations were noticed by other studies examining MS spectra from Covid-19 patients [19,22]. Effectively, only partial distinctions could be identified between infected and uninfected individuals. Based on the above observations, we can assume that dimension reduction algorithms struggle to separate groups because the inter-individual heterogeneity of spectra profiles is large and stronger than the differences between infected and non-infected groups. These intergroup differences are due to a few biomarkers the differential expression of which contributes little to the overall heterogeneity.4. DiscussionAs the differences between the groups are masked by the overall heterogeneity, five ML models were implemented to specifically identify and combine protein profiles in order to increase their effectiveness in separating the groups. The training process of the models allowed us to determine that the SVM model with linear kernel was the best model, based on the F1-score [12,47]. Saliva spectra were classified with a high accuracy (i.e., 85%). These results are comparable to or better than the performance of ML models already described for COVID-19 diagnosis [12,20]. Several studies established that the SVM model performed the best predictions [12,19,21].4. DiscussionTo confirm the performance and the robustness of the selected classifier, the SVM-LK model was applied to independent datasets (Test 1 to 5). First, an independent set was constructed by including all saliva spectra, excluding the spectra used in the training set and those classified as uncertain negatives. The performance on this set was a little lower than on the training set, with an accuracy of 77.8%. The spectra were then split according to the collection time (i.e., D0, D10, and D30). The separate evaluation on these independent datasets revealed good predictions at D0 (89%) and D30 (81%). In contrast, at D10, a low accuracy was obtained, notably, due to the incorrect classification of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples by the ML model (sensitivity lower than 45%). The weak performance of the ML model on this test set may be due to the gradual recovery of infected patients. It could be hypothesized that a progressive disappearance of the protein pattern linked to the spectra classification in the Cov+ group occurred during the recovery situation. A recent study demonstrated that the concordance of correct classification between saliva and NPS samples by RT-qPCR was lower for convalescent patients [11], and which was corroborated by others [48]. The mitigated results of classification were attributed to an intermediate status of patients, whom are no longer at peak disease but not yet fully recovered.4. DiscussionTest 5 consists of patients defined as uncertain negative samples for SARS-CoV-2. The discrepancy in classification between the molecular results and the model prediction can be explained by several factors. First, as all individuals from the Cov+ group were diagnosed molecularly as positive for SARS-CoV-2 a few days before enrollment, it is likely that several of them remained positive on the enrollment day (D0) and that the incorrect prediction could be attributed to a molecular miss-detection of the virus on NPSs. Effectively, as the initial saliva sample (D0) was carried out less than 5 days after the onset of symptoms (median days—IQR: 2.2—1–3), it was expected that their COVID-19 infectious status was molecularly confirmed at the enrolment day (D0) for nearly all of them. Unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-qPCR were confirmed for solely 76.1% (n = 105/138) of the patients. Previous studies reported that the risk of false-negative diagnosis is not infrequent and was estimated around 30% by molecular detection of the virus in NPSs [49]. Furthermore, others reported that COVID-19 miss-diagnosis could reach up to 50% of suspected cases using NPS specimens [39,50]. For these reasons, patients from the Cov+ group, classified negatives by RT-PCR on NPSs at D0 and D10, were considered as uncertain negatives to avoid miss-interpretation and learning errors. Retesting of NPS samples to control the rate of false-negatives would be advisable, nevertheless, it was not possible because the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 on NPS samples was performed in the frame of routine laboratory diagnosis and we do not have access to these samples. Despite a negative RT-qPCR result, the persistence of virus molecules or infection-related proteins would likely occur, and sustainability of serological inflammatory markers several days or weeks after patients recovery was reported [51,52]. These long-term protein dysregulations could perturb ML classification. 4. DiscussionThe second hypothesis could be that the virus was recently cleared from these individuals, at least in the nasopharyngeal part, and that they are therefore truly negative for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, despite the disappearance of the virus, it is conceivable that traces of the infection could persist for a longer period of time leading to incongruent results between the ML model and the molecular analysis. The correct classification of more than 80% of the samples at D30 by the SVM-LK model comforts this claim. We noted that the majority of studies did not evaluate performances of ML models on an independent dataset [19,21], but established the performance metrics on the training set. Two studies tested the ML models on an independent dataset [12,20]. The performance of the ML models was noticeably lower than that obtained on the training set, suggesting an overfitting of the model to the training data. To avoid this problem and to obtain an unbiased measure of the performance of the model, it is essential to use an independent test set [12]. Interestingly, the exclusion of samples for which doubt persisted after molecular classification (i.e., convalescent patients from Test 3 and uncertain negative samples from Test 5) allowed us to establish the performances of the SVM-LK model. Pooling samples from Test 2 (patients collected at D0 with molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and Test 4 (recovered patients collected at D30 and healthy individuals) revealed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 88.9%, 80.8%, and 84.9%, respectively.4. DiscussionThe main originality of our study was the use of saliva as the specimen. Although previous works reported the potential of MALDI-TOF MS to monitor SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host immune response against the virus using water gargle samples as saliva collection [53,54], these specimen collections would be unappropriated for young children or the elderly. Unlike NPSs, saliva collection is a non-invasive technique which can be performed by the patients themselves and prevents the risk of contamination for healthcare workers [55,56]. Previous works reported the potential of MALDI-TOF MS to monitor SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host immune response against the virus using water gargle samples as saliva collection [53,54]. The introduction of the Salivette® device has standardized the collection and improved the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to NPSs [11]. However, it has recently been reported that mouth washing before collection impaired the detection of the virus in saliva [57], that is why here the molecular results of NPSs were used as a reference for sample classification. A mouth washing was systematically proposed to all individuals enrolled in the present study prior to saliva collection, as numerous patients ate and/or drank while waiting for their turn at the hospital. The record attendance occurred during the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in the south of France, resulting in a long wait to be diagnosed. It is possible that the mouth washing could also have reduced the protein signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and thus altered the performance of ML models for sample classification. To assess the effect of mouthwash on model performance, complementary experiments are required in which individuals who ingested drink or food in the hour prior salivation collection will be excluded [58]. 4. DiscussionRecently, a work associating RT-PCR and MALDI-TOF MS was applied for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva samples [59]. Conversely to the present study which researched a specific protein signature associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection, Hernandez et al. targeted, by MALDI-TOF MS, the detection of RT-PCR products from the virus [59]. The main advantages of the RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF MS-based system are a direct detection of amplicons from the virus and the possibility to detect simultaneously several targets. Although, the saliva quantity (about 300 µL) and time required to obtain the results (> 8 h) are more important than the strategy used here, the opportunity to realize multiplexing could allow virus mutations and consequently SARS-CoV-2 variants to be identified.4. DiscussionThe performance of ML models to predict clinical symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients will also be evaluated using saliva as the specimen. The characterization of such protein markers will be used to predict the favorable or unfavorable clinical course of a patient in order to guide physicians on the actions to be taken. A recent study reported that the application of ML models on serum samples succeeded in predicting the clinical evolution of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients [21]. The main limitation of the present work was the lack of saliva samples from individuals infected by another virus such as influenza. The enrollment of individuals with flu symptoms was initially planned in order to test whether it was also possible to separate COVID-19 infections from other respiratory viruses. Unfortunately for our study, during the 2020 summer period in France, the application of barrier gestures and social distancing participated likely in the prevention of the emergence of respiratory diseases and therefore it was impossible to recruit patients from this group. The potential of ML models to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has already been demonstrated based on the analysis of MS profiles from NPS [20].4. DiscussionThe aim of works using MALDI-TOF MS profiling plus ML models for COVID-19 diagnosis was not to obtain a direct detection of the viral proteins, but rather to identify a specific protein signature associated to viral infection [19,20]. Characterization of the protein(s) involved in this signature is not required at all for successful classification. Characterization of the signature peaks can be carried out in a second step to determine the identity and origin of the proteins involved. Two recent studies [21,22] applying a similar strategy onto NPS or serum specimens demonstrated that the identity of proteins beside MS peaks that allowed for the classification of the samples was of human origin (i.e., serum amyloid proteins A1 and A2), confirming that the detection of viral proteins were not necessary for correct classification of the sample.4. DiscussionA recent publication [60] established an original COVID-19 diagnostic strategy to detect selected viral peptides in NPS specimens. It combines immuno-affinity purification followed by high resolution MS-based target assay and parallel monitoring reaction assays (PRM). The application of ML models on data from PRM assays allowed a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 100% to be reached compared to qRT-PCR for determining COVID-19-positive samples. Moreover, the performance of this strategy compared to Ag RDTs (rapid antigen diagnostic tests) revealed a significantly higher sensitivity for the MS antigen approach compared to nearly all Ag RDTs assessed (3 among 4 tested) [61]. These works confirmed the high potential of MS approaches for the clinical diagnosis of infectious agents, which could be helpful when tensions occurred in molecular reagent supply or when the systems are saturated.4. DiscussionIn conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS with the collection of salivary samples offers real new perspectives of SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnostics. The non-necessity of RT-qPCR test and the affordable cost of the MALDI-TOF MS analysis per sample could allow a massive test of the population in order to distinguish infected from uninfected individuals, thus bringing potential improvements to sanitary conditions."
"Resilience, COVID-19-related stress, anxiety and depression during the pandemic in a large population enriched for healthcare providers","The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting humankind in unprecedented and monumental ways and data is needed to plan for next steps following the acute outbreak. In addition to physical health, coping with the pandemic requires mental resilience. Tools have been established to estimate resilience, broadly conceptualized as healthy and adaptive functioning in the aftermath of adversity2. Measuring resilience can (1) allow better planning of resource allocation and (2) inform interventions for individuals and communities to overcome the acute pandemic effects3 expected to impact mental health4. Healthcare providers are on the frontlines of the pandemic response and already show deleterious mental health consequences5. Hence, there is an urgent need to gauge the role of resilience specifically in this population6.IntroductionThe internet has transformed our ability to collect large-scale data through crowdsourcing, with rapid outreach to large samples complying with social distancing7. We previously developed and applied a tool to measure resilience using self-report items8. Here, we applied an interactive online platform to measure resilience in a population enriched for healthcare providers. We hypothesized that (1) COVID-19 related stress (estimated by subjective worries) will be associated with generalized anxiety and depression; (2) higher resilience scores would correlate with less worries, generalized anxiety and depression; (3) healthcare providers will report higher levels of COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety and depression. We also explored differences in COVID-19 related stress and resilience between participants from US and Israel.Participants and procedures ::: Subjects and methodsOn April 6th 2020, we launched a website (https://www.covid19resilience.org/) that included an interactive 21-item resilience survey and assessment of COVID-19-related stress (worries) regarding: (1) getting (contracting), (2) dying from, (3) currently having, (4) family member getting, (5) unknowingly infecting others, and (6) experiencing significant financial burden following COVID-19. Participants were asked to rate how much they worried on a 5-item scale (0—not at all; 1—a little; 2—a moderate amount; 3—a lot; 4—a great deal). At the end of the survey, participants received feedback on their resilience scores with personalized recommendations regarding stress management. The feedback was also meant to incentivize participants to complete the survey carefully. Next, participants were offered to take a second survey on their anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder 7 questionnaire (GAD7))9 and depression (patient health questionnaire 2 (PHQ2))10. The study was advertised through, (1) the researchers’ social networks, including emails to colleagues around the world; (2) social media; (3) the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia internal notifications; and (4) organizational mailing lists. In addition to English, the survey was available in Hebrew after a two-way reverse translation and consensus by three bilingual English-Hebrew speakers. The results presented here are based on data collected from April 6 to 15, 2020. Participation required responders to provide online consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.Resilience survey ::: Subjects and methodsThe survey was based on questions associated with resilience that were recently compiled into a single battery8. The items included were identified following administration of 212 items to >250 participants. The 212 items were reduced, using factor analysis followed by computerized adaptive test simulation, to a 47-item battery comprising seven factors8. For the sake of brevity and scalability of the online survey, we use five of the seven factors, resulting in a 21-item abbreviated version: self-reliance (3 items)11; emotion regulation (5 items)12; positive (4 items) and negative (5 items)13 relationship characteristics; and neighborhood characteristics (4 items)14,15. Resilience items included in the survey and their corresponding scores are described in Supplementary Table 1. To create a resilience score, we summed the score on all 21 items after coding them such that a higher score always indicates higher resilience.Data analysis ::: Subjects and methodsFor COVID-19 related worries, all main and interaction effects were investigated using mixed models to account for within-person variance across items. The mixed model treated the 6 items of COVID-19 worry/stress (evaluated at the same time in this cross-sectional study) as repeated measures within individual. The key dependent variable was item response (5-point scale indicating level of COVID-19-related worry), and we addressed the following questions: (1) Are certain types of worry more common than others? (2) Are there sex differences or age-related effects on the type of worry? (3) Is resilience associated with lower worry? (4) Does the effect of resilience depend on the type of worry? (5) Do the pattern of effects differ in healthcare providers? All models included the following potential confounders: age, gender, race (white/non-white), education, income, occupation (healthcare, engineering/computers and other), marital status (married, single or other), country of residence (US, Israel or other), number of people in household, date at which the survey was taken (days and (days squared) since study launch), and exposures related directly to COVID-19 including getting tested for COVID-19, knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and knowing someone who died from COVID-19. All analyses were performed using the lmerTest16 package in R.Data analysis ::: Subjects and methodsTo evaluate the association of COVID-19 related stress with anxiety and depression, we used regression models with COVID-19-related worries (standardized z-score of the sum all 6 worry questions) as the independent variable. The key dependent variable was either a dichotomized measure of meeting screening levels of GAD and depression (binary logistic regression); or continuous GAD7 and PHQ2 score (linear regression). Based on reports of overall higher scoring in anxiety17 and depression18 in web-based compared to paper and pencil surveys, we chose more conservative cutoffs to capture moderate and above anxiety or depression. GAD7 score > 10 was considered a case of probable generalized anxiety19, PHQ2 score > 2 was considered a case of probable depression20. Models covaried for age, gender, race, education, income, occupation, marital status, country of residence, number of people in household, and date at which the survey was taken.Data analysis ::: Subjects and methodsTo evaluate the mitigating effect of resilience on generalized anxiety and depression, resilience score was considered as the independent variable, with continuous GAD7 or PHQ2 score (using linear regression) or dichotomous GAD/depression (using binary logistic model) as the dependent variables. All models included multiple co-variates as described above. Effects of gender, age, and being a healthcare provider were tested in separate models including interaction terms of all of the above with resilience overall score.Data analysis ::: Subjects and methodsIn an exploratory analysis we compared participants from the US and Israel using regression models with US/Israel as a binary independent variable and COVID-19 worries/stress, resilience, anxiety, and depression as the dependent variables. Models included all covariates listed above.Data analysis ::: Subjects and methodsAll regression analyses were conducted in SPSS version 26 (IBM).COVID-19-related worries ::: ResultsParticipants were significantly more worried about a family member contracting COVID-19 or about unknowingly infecting others than about getting COVID-19 themselves (Fig. 1a, item main effect F5,15205 = 1536.0, p < 0.00001, model included age, gender, education, income, marital status, number of people in household and country of residence). Participants worried to a similar extent about financial burden following COVID-19 as about getting COVID-19; worried less about dying from COVID-19; and worried least about currently having COVID-19. Females had overall higher COVID-19-related worries than males, except for the financial burden, where they were comparable to males (Fig. 1b, item-by-sex interaction F5,15200 = 25.9; p < 0.00001). The pattern of worrying more about others compared to self was consistent throughout the lifespan. Older participants worried more about themselves than their younger counterparts, but still worried more about others (Fig. 1c, item-by-age interaction F5,15200 = 71.6; p < 0.00001).Anxiety and depression ::: ResultsWe evaluated generalized anxiety and depression in a subsample of n = 1350 who completed the GAD7 and PHQ2 questionnaire (Fig. 2). This subsample did not differ from the participants who did not complete GAD7/PHQ2 scales (n = 1692) in terms COVID-19-related worries (worry sum score, t test, p = 0.387) or composite resilience score (t-test p = 0.932). Female gender was associated with higher scores on GAD7 (standardized beta = 0.143, p < 0.001) and PHQ2 (standardized beta = 0.069, p = 0.03), and with higher rates of meeting threshold screening for GAD (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.24–2.99, p = 0.004), but not with meeting threshold depression (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.93–2.32, p = 0.103). Older age was associated with lower likelihood of meeting threshold anxiety (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.98, p < 0.00001) but not for depression (p = 0.17). Models included race, education, income, occupation, country of residence and number of people in household as co-variates.Association among COVID-19-related worries, generalized anxiety, and depression ::: ResultsHigher endorsement of COVID-19-related worries was strongly associated with meeting threshold screening for generalized anxiety (GAD7 score > 10, n = 300, 22.2%) and depression (PHQ2 score > 2, n = 217, 16.1%), such that for every 1 SD increase in the standardized composite score of COVID-19 worries, there was more than 2-fold increased probability of generalized anxiety (binary logistic regression OR = 2.23 95% CI: 1.88–2.65, p < 0.001; linear regression standardized beta = 0.396, t = 15.571, p < 0.001) and 67% increased probability of depression (binary logistic regression OR = 1.67 95% CI: 1.41–1.98, p < 0.001; linear regression standardized beta = 0.212, t = 7.266, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the strength of association between different types of COVID-19 related worries (to self, others or financial burden) and anxiety or depression (Supplementary Table 2). Models covaried for age, gender, education, occupation, income, marital status, number of people in household, country of residence, and date taking the survey.Association of resilience score with COVID-19-related worries, generalized anxiety, and depression ::: ResultsThe composite resilience score derived from the 21-item survey buffered all the COVID-19-related worries, such that participants with higher resilience scores worried significantly less than low scoring individuals about COVID-19 (Fig. 3a, main effect F1,3023 = 134.9; p < 0.00001). Furthermore, higher resilience scores were associated with lower generalized anxiety (total GAD7 score, linear regression standardized beta −0.418, t = −16.44, p < 0.001) and depression (total PHQ2 score, linear regression standardized beta −0.451, t = −16.72, p < 0.001). The effect was such that for every 1 SD increase in the resilience score there was a 64.9% decrease in the possibility of positive-GAD screen (binary logistic regression OR = 0.351, 95% CI: 0.29–0.424, p < 0.0001, Fig. 3b) and a 69.3% decrease in the possibility of positive depression screen (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.252–0.383, p < 0.0001, Fig. 3b).Association of resilience score with COVID-19-related worries, generalized anxiety, and depression ::: ResultsThe inverse association of high resilience score with meeting screening threshold of anxiety and depression was consistent across genders (resilience by gender interaction nonsignificant). Overall, the mitigating association of higher resilience with lower probability of anxiety was stronger in older age (resilience score by age interaction Wald = 6.955, p = 0.008 for GAD), with trend level significance for depression (resilience score by age interaction Wald = 3.378, p = 0.066).Comparison between US and Israel participants ::: ResultsThe majority of our study sample were from the US (n = 1607) or Israel (n = 1197). We conducted exploratory comparisons between samples from the two countries. Participants from the two countries differed on demographics (Supplementary Table 3). Except for age that was similar in both countries, the US sample included more females (84 vs. 39%), more healthcare providers (29 vs. 11%) with higher education and higher income compared to Israel.Comparison between US and Israel participants ::: ResultsMultivariate comparison that co-varied for multiple confounders revealed that participants from the US were overall more worried/stressed about COVID-19 (Table 2). US participants were specifically more stressed about self (contracting COVD-19, dying from COVID-19 and currently having COVID-19) compared to Israel participants, with no differences in worries about others (family getting COVID-19/infecting others) or about financial burden due to COVID-19 (Table 2). Israel participants scored higher overall on the resilience scale (standardized beta = 0.163, t = 5.694, p < 0.001). US participants were more likely to meet screening criteria for GAD (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 2.6–9.4, p < 0.001) and for depression (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2–4, p < 0.001).Sensitivity analyses in healthcare providers ::: ResultsDue to the high percentage of healthcare providers (physicians, nurses, and other direct patient care, n = 625) in this sample, we repeated the above analyses including interactions with healthcare profession status. In COVID-19-related worries, the only difference was that healthcare providers worried more than non-healthcare providers about contracting COVID-19 (t15340 = 3.9, p < 0.0005) and less than non-healthcare providers about finances after COVID-19 (t15340 = −6.9, p < 0.00001, Supplementary Fig. 1). We did not detect higher anxiety and depression in healthcare providers compared to non-healthcare providers (Supplementary Fig. 2).Sensitivity analyses in healthcare providers ::: ResultsHigher resilience scores were associated with less COVID-19-related worries similarly across healthcare providers and non-health care professionals (main effect F1,3053 = 102.0, p < 0.00001; resilience by healthcare providers interaction nonsignificant, Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, higher resilience scores were associated with lower likelihood of meeting GAD or depression screening threshold across professions (resilience by healthcare providers interaction nonsignificant, Supplementary Fig. 4).DiscussionThe rapid spread of COVID-19 creates a unique opportunity to evaluate resilience in the face of a single global adversity. Here, we captured a unique snapshot for over 3000 people who were in stressful conditions during the acute pandemic outbreak (>92% of our sample are from US or Israel that were in lockdown during the study period). Participants reported significantly more subjective worries (stress) about others (~50% worried about family member getting COVID-19) than about getting COVID-19 themselves (~20%). This pattern was consistent across genders, throughout the lifespan and was overall similar in healthcare providers compared to non-healthcare providers. This finding is consistent with work reporting increased prosocial behavior under stress21, and may be related to “tend-and-befriend”, where in response to threat humans tend to protect their close ones (tending) and seek out their social group for mutual defense (befriending)22. This finding might be interpreted as a form of altruism during acute stress of the pandemic outbreak. Notably, altruistic behavior described in acute situations throughout history was previously linked to mechanisms of resilience for overcoming adversity23.DiscussionThe COVID-19-related worries were associated with substantial levels of anxiety (22%) and depression (16%) in the subsample that completed the GAD7 and PHQ2 questionnaires (n = 1350). These rates are higher than previously reported point prevalence rates24,25. Several explanations may account for the higher reported levels of anxiety and depression. First, it was previously described that people report more symptoms in web-based surveys17,18. Second, our sample was enriched for women, who are known to report more anxiety and depression. In that sense the expected gender differences we observed support the validity of our data26. Lastly, it is possible that during the acute phase of the pandemic when the data was collected, and in light of the high level of stress and worries related to COVID-19, there are higher levels of anxiety and depression in the population as reflected in our convenience sample. The rates we report here are also higher than the rates reported in healthcare providers during the acute COVID-19 outbreak in China5. This effect might be explained by cultural differences or difference in sampling, as we used an online survey and the Chinese study sampled through hospitals.DiscussionSupporting our hypothesis, the brief online resilience survey inversely correlated with COVID-19 worries, generalized anxiety and depression symptoms. The survey may tap into traits and factors that allow a buffering against COVID-19 related stressors. This “buffering effect” was evident in both genders, throughout the lifespan, and in a similar manner in healthcare and non-healthcare providers. Notably, while there is need for more longitudinal data on resilience27, scarce longitudinal data suggests that baseline resilience mitigates developing anxiety and depression following adversity28. Therefore, the framework described in this study can be used in longitudinal studies that evaluate trajectories of mental health conditions and needs following the pandemic outbreak.DiscussionThis study’s main strength is the large sample and the unique timing of data collection, in which vast majority of the sample (>90% are from the US or Israel) were in lockdown, with closures of school and nonessential businesses. These unusual life circumstances are likely to have major impact on mental health29, and thus provide an opportunity to study resilience in the face of a global stressor. Despite the global nature of the stressor, we found significant differences between participants from Israel and the US, the latter reporting more stress, anxiety and depression. The reasons for these difference require further investigation, but it should be noted that the two countries greatly differ is their size in terms of geographic area, total population, GDP, in addition to differences in other social, cultural, political, economic and health system characteristics. Our findings might imply that local factors may contribute to the levels of stress, resilience and mental health at times of global pandemic. Specifically, it is possible that residents of countries more accustomed to dealing with collective stressors (such as Israel, due to frequent war-related events), can recruit more resilience factors during an acute stressor such as a pandemic outbreak. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether these differences between countries are maintained longitudinally, beyond the acute stress of the outbreak, as the stress is likely to shift from the medical consequences of COVID-19 to the economic impact.DiscussionSeveral study limitations should be considered. These include the biased sampling to a more educated, professional population that is enriched for healthcare providers and academics. More data is required from other sociodemographic backgrounds that appear to be more vulnerable30. There are also the inherent limitations of data collection through crowdsourcing (i.e., how generalizable are people who complete online surveys)31. However, we did not pay participants, but rather provided feedback based on their responses, which mitigates the concern that a participant deliberately answered inaccurately, as a main incentive to take the survey was to receive personalized feedback. In addition, we used brief screening measures for anxiety and depression. As for the healthcare providers’ data, we did not collect data regarding exposure to COVID-19 patients, militating our ability to link this exposure form to the “pandemic response frontline” to the measures studied here. Lastly, the cross-sectional design does not allow causal inferences, which can be addressed in future longitudinal studies.DiscussionTo conclude, we present data collected from a large convenience sample in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the majority of the sample was bound to a “lockdown” with severe social distancing. We report two main findings: (1) People are worried more about others than about self when reporting COVID-19 concerns; (2) Resilience helps reduce worries as well as anxiety and depression. Longitudinal studies are needed to address whether resilience scores are consistent and whether they can predict trajectories of mental and general health as humanity moves toward the post-COVID-19 pandemic era."
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through spike protein-CD147 in an Arf6-dependent manner,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has given rise to a global pandemic, which brought serious harm to human health. The emergence of variants, such as delta and omicron, enhances viral transmission and immune escape, posing a huge challenge to overcome the epidemic [1,2]. Therefore, it is indispensable to elucidate the mechanism of virus infection, providing a theoretical basis for treating COVID-19.IntroductionIt has been reported that the entry modes of most viruses involve membrane fusion and endocytosis, which are the key steps for viral propagation [3]. The process of membrane fusion is initiated by fusion peptides, which then allow the release of the viral genome in the host cells [4]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a vital cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection via membrane fusion [5]. The S1 subunit of spike protein serves the function of binding to ACE2, followed by the fusion of the virus and cell membrane to release the virus genome into the cell, which is mediated by the S2 subunit of spike protein [6,7]. Endocytosis is an important entry mode for virus infection. Most viruses depend on endocytic uptake, vesicular transport, and delivery to intracellular organelles. The main types of endocytosis contain clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, Arf6-dependent endocytosis, and flotillin-dependent endocytosis [8,9]. Numerous viruses employ multiple endocytic pathways to infect the host cells [10–12]. As for SARS-CoV-2, endocytosis plays an essential role in virus infection.IntroductionOur previous study showed that CD147 is a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through CD147-mediated endocytosis [13]. However, the mechanism of CD147-mediated viral endocytosis is still unclear. CD147 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein (also known as basigin, M6, or EMMPRIN [14–16]), which is closely involved in tumor progression, inflammatory response, plasmodium invasion, and viral infection [13,17–21]. The internalization of CD147 depends on clathrin-independent endocytosis, which is closely related to ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), a master regulator of membrane trafficking [22]. Based on the above researches, there still exists a necessity to investigate the possible role of Arf6 in CD147-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection.IntroductionIn our study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry was related to caveolar/lipid raft- and cytoskeleton-mediated endocytosis. CD147 was an important receptor for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, which was regulated by Arf6-dependent endocytosis. Our study gives new insights into the endocytic pathway of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to understanding the process of the virus infection and provides a potential target for COVID-19 treatment.Cell lines ::: Materials and methodsVero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Osaka, Japan), respectively.

Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (H + L) (ZB-2306, ZSGB-Bio), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) secondary antibody, HRP (31460, Invitrogen), and goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody, HRP (31430, Invitrogen) were used in western blot analysis. The endocytic fluorescent markers were used in this study, including Alexa Fluor 555 dextran (D34679, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 555 transferrin from human serum (T35352, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 555 cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, C34776, Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (A12379, Invitrogen). Hoechst 33342 (C1022, Beyotime) and 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine (DAPI, C1002, Beyotime) were used to stain the nuclei. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, C0005, Topscience) and a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (E1980, Promega) were also used in the study.Cytotoxicity assay ::: Materials and methodsVero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 37°C overnight, and then, incubated with different concentrations of the inhibitors for 48 h. Subsequently, the supernatants were removed and the mixed solution (100μl DMEM plus 10 μl cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent) was added to each well. After incubating at 37°C for 1 h, the optical density (OD) value was determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Epoch).Cellular uptake assay ::: Materials and methodsVero E6 cells (8 × 104 cells/dish) were cultured in a confocal dish overnight, and then, incubated with corresponding inhibitors in the DMEM (2% FBS) or DMEM (2% FBS) only for 24 h at 37°C. Next, the cells were kept on ice for 10 min and washed with a cold live cell imaging solution (LCIS, A14291DJ, Invitrogen) containing 20 mM glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubating with the endocytosis fluorescent markers (dextran, transferrin, and CTB) at 37°C for 2–4 h, the cells were washed with the LCIS, and Hoechst 33342 was used to stain the nuclei for 10 min. After being washed with the LCIS twice, the dishes were immediately observed to capture the images in a fluorescent microscope.Pseudovirus infection assay ::: Materials and methodsLuciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit (E1980, Promega). Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells (104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates overnight at 37°C. The cell supernatants were removed and the mixed solution (100 μl DMEM plus 5 μl SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus) was added to each well. After incubating at 37°C for 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a 50 μl passive lysis buffer with gentle rocking for 20 min at room temperature. Then, a 100 μl luciferase assay reagent II was added to each well, and the data were obtained from a luminometer (E5311, Promega). For the virus inhibition assay, the cells were incubated with corresponding inhibitors in the DMEM (2% FBS) for 24 h or were transfected with siRNAs before the virus infection.siRNA transfection ::: Materials and methodsGene silencing was conducted by transfecting siRNA (GenePharma) using a jetPRIME® transfection reagent (PT-114-15, Polyplus) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The siRNA sequences for the targeted genes are listed as follows: Materials and methodsTo obtain the protein samples, the cells were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed in the RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime) supplemented with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, ST505, Beyotime). The protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay kit (P0011, Beyotime); then the lysate was mixed with a 5× loading buffer and heated for 10 min at 100°C. The protein samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to the PVDF membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore). After being blocked with 5% skimmed milk in the TBST buffer for 1 h, the PVDF membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Arf6 antibody, PA1-093, Invitrogen; rabbit anti-Rab5a antibody, 2143T, cell signaling technology; mouse anti-CD147 antibody, orb251620, Biorbyt; goat anti-ACE2 antibody, AF933, R&D Systems; mouse anti-tubulin antibody, 66031-1-Ig, Proteintech) at 4°C overnight. Next, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (H + L), ZB-2306, ZSGB-Bio; goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) secondary antibody, HRP, 31460, Invitrogen; goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody, HRP, 31430, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature and the images were obtained and analyzed using the Image Lab software (BIO-RAD).Immunofluorescence staining ::: Materials and methodsThe cells were cultured in confocal dishes overnight at 37°C, and then, incubated with a 2% FBS DMEM with 30μl SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or a 2% FBS DMEM only for 24 h. Next, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde fix solution (AR1069, Boster) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton X-100 (A600198-0500, BBI Life Sciences) for 3 min, followed by incubation with 5% goat serum for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Arf6 antibody, PA1-093, Invitrogen; rabbit anti-Rab5a antibody, 2143T, cell signaling technology; mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody, Sino Biological; human anti-CD147 antibody, MPZ, Jiangsu Pacific Meinuoke Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd) overnight at 4°C. After being washed three times with PBS, the cells were stained with corresponding immunofluorescent secondary antibodies (goat anti-human IgG (H + L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647, A21445, Invitrogen, donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488, A21202, Invitrogen, donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 555, A31572, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, and DAPI was used to stain the nuclei for 10 min. The images were collected using confocal laser scanning microscopy.Statistical analysis ::: Materials and methodsAll statistical data were performed using the GraphPad Prism V8.0. These experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using a student’s t-test or student’s t-test with Welch's correction. P < 0.05 was considered to be a significant difference.SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through CD147-mediated endocytosis ::: ResultsOur previous study showed that CD147 is a vital receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which facilitates viral entry through endocytosis [13]. In our study, a pseudovirus infection assay was performed using CD147 silencing cells and the result showed that the knockdown of CD147 in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells significantly inhibited pseudovirus infection (Figure 1A, B). Vero E6-CD147KO cell line was also constructed using a CRISPR-Cas9 system and a similar finding was obtained in the pseudovirus infection assay (Figure 1C). Rab5a is located in the plasma membrane and early endosomes, which functions as a key regulatory molecule for vesicle transport during early endocytosis [24–26]. To investigate the role of Rab5a in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, Rab5a knockdown-Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells were constructed and the pseudovirus infection assay that demonstrated Rab5a silencing in these cells markedly attenuated viral infection (Figure 1D, E). We also found that the silencing of CD147 or Rab5a in Vero E6 cells has no impact on the expression of ACE2 in the mRNA and protein levels (Sup. Figure 1A-D). Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining showed the co-localization of CD147 and Rab5a in Vero E6 cells (Figure 1F), as well as the silencing of CD147 in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells, which decreased the expression of Rab5a using RT–PCR (Figure 1G, H). To confirm CD147-mediated SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis, immunofluorescence staining was performed using confocal microscopy to detect the localization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, CD147, and Rab5a. As shown in Figure 1I, J, a strong co-localization among spike protein (green), Rab5a (red), and CD147 (white), characterized a punctate pattern and was observed surrounding the cytoplasm near the membrane regions of Vero E6 cells, while a weakened signal of CD147 (white), Rab5a (red) and spike protein (green) was observed in the CD147 silencing cells. These results further indicated that the deficiency of CD147 prevented the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and Rab5a expression. Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through CD147-mediated endocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through spike protein-CD147 in an Arf6-dependent manner ::: ResultsIt has been reported that the main types of endocytosis for virus infection contain clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis [8,9]. To clarify the endocytic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry, some inhibitors of endocytic routes were used to perform the virus inhibitory assays, including EIPA (an inhibitor of macropinocytosis), CPZ (an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis), cyto D (an inhibitor of actin polymerization), nocodazole (depolymerizing microtubules), MCD, and filipin III (inhibitors of caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis). Primarily, cell cytotoxicity was conducted to screen appropriate working concentrations of pharmacologic inhibitors by the CCK-8 assay. According to the methods adopted in previous study, the concentration of EIPA (10, 20, 30, 50, 100 μM), CPZ (5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 50 μM), MCD (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 9 mM), filipin III (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 μg/ml), cyto D (100, 125, 250, 300, 500, 700, 900, 1000 nM), and nocodazole (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500 nM) were set up. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the optimal concentration of EIPA, CPZ, MCD, filipin III, cyto D, and nocodazole were 30 μM, 25 μM, 3 mM, 1 μg/ml, 300 nM, and 100 nM, respectively (Figure 2A). To verify the inhibitory effect of these inhibitors under the selected concentrations, dextran (an endocytic marker for macropinocytosis), transferrin (a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis), and CTB (a marker for caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis) were used to perform the cellular uptake tests. The results demonstrated that the selected concentrations had an obvious effect on the blocking endocytosis of corresponding markers (Figure 2B). Meanwhile, phalloidin was used to evaluate the effect of cyto D on disrupting actin polymerization, and the result showed that a 300 nM cyto D exhibited a good inhibitory effect (Figure 2C).SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through spike protein-CD147 in an Arf6-dependent manner ::: ResultsSubsequently, the pseudovirus inhibitory assays were performed and we found that cyto D, nocodazole, filipin III, and MCD significantly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection for Vero E6 cells, while no obvious change was observed in the CPZ and EIPA groups (Figure 3A). These findings indicate that the dominating endocytosis pathways, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and micropinocytosis are not involved in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for the host cells. Instead, caveolar/lipid raft- and cytoskeleton-mediated endocytosis might participate or assist in the entry process of SARS-CoV-2. To explore the role of CD147 in the screened endocytosis pathways, Vero E6-CD147KO cells were used to perform the pseudovirus inhibitory assays with four inhibitors of MCD, filipin III, cyto D, and nocodazole. Compared to the control group, all four inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in Vero E6-CD147KO cells, which is consistent with the results obtained in Vero E6 cells (Figure 3B). This result indicated that CD147 was not involved in caveolar/lipid raft- and cytoskeleton-dependent endocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enters the host cells through spike protein-CD147 in an Arf6-dependent manner ::: ResultsIt has been reported that the internalization of CD147 depends on clathrin-independent endocytosis, which is closely related to Arf6 [22,27]. Therefore, we investigated the possible role of Arf6 in CD147-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Arf6 was knocked down in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells using a specific siRNA, and the silencing efficiency of Arf6 was assessed by RT–PCR (Figure 3C, D). Compared to the control group, Arf6 silencing markedly reduced the infection of pseudovirus (Figure 3C, D), which indicated that Arf6 contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. The expression of ACE2 in the mRNA and protein levels has little change in Arf6 knockdown-Vero E6 cells (Sup. Figure 1E, F). On the contrary, in Vero E6-CD147KO cells, pseudovirus entry was not prevented by silencing Arf6 (Figure 3E). In addition, the co-localization of CD147 (white) and Arf6 (red) was observed in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescent staining (Figure 4A). We also found the co-localization of spike protein (green), CD147 (white), and Arf6 (red) in Vero E6 cells in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Figure 4B). Immunofluorescent staining showed that the knockdown of Arf6 caused the reduction of pseudovirus infection (Figure 4B), which in accordance with the results, was obtained from the luciferase reporter assay. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus enter the host cells through spike protein-CD147 in an Arf6-dependent manner. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants poses an international health emergency. The infection of SASR-CoV-2 depends on the binding of spike protein and receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for infection and transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is necessary for spike protein priming, which contributes to ACE2-mediated virus infection [28]. Neuropilin-1 is a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and the antibody against neuropilin-1 attenuates virus infection [29]. AXL is reported to specifically interact with the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which promotes the infection of pulmonary and bronchial epithelial cells [30]. Our previous study shows that CD147 facilitates virus infection for the host cells by interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Interestingly, sequential endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is observed by an electron microscope, and the co-localization of CD147, spike protein, and Rab5 is detected in the lung tissues of a patient with COVID-19. These results show that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through CD147-mediated endocytosis [13]. In this study, the silencing of CD147 and Rab5a significantly inhibits virus entry, and similar observations from immunofluorescence staining are obtained in Vero E6 cells, which are weakened by CD147 silence. Our findings provide abundant evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus employs CD147 to infect the host cells by endocytosis.DiscussionEndocytosis plays a vital role in the infection of numerous viruses. However, the precise endocytic mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 entry are still unclear. The most common pathways of endocytosis include clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and cytoskeleton system. Therefore, we first ascertain whether SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through the above routes. In our study, the use of corresponding pharmacological inhibitors has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The treatment with inhibitors of the caveolar/lipid raft and cytoskeleton reduces the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Therefore, the caveolar/lipid raft and cytoskeleton system may involve or assist in the entry process of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Lipid rafts enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol are functional membrane microdomains, which provide a platform to allow receptors such as ACE2, CD147, and TMPRSS2 to be recruited for binding to the viral spike protein [31–34]. A cytoskeleton is composed of three major types of cytoskeletal polymers including actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments [35]. Dynamic actin rearrangements are crucial for coronavirus entry [36,37]. Therefore, the inhibitors of the caveolar/lipid raft and cytoskeleton system can be used as a potential tool to treat COVID-19.DiscussionIn our study, we also explored the specific endocytosis type for the CD147-mediated viral infection. A previous study showed that the endocytic recycling of CD147 is closely related to Arf6-mediated endocytosis [27,38]. Arf6-mediated internalization requires the involvement of cholesterol and cytoskeleton, and after internalization, cargo-containing endosomes fuse with Rab5-positive sorting endosomes [8,39,40]. Therefore, we investigate the possible role of Arf6 in CD147-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunofluorescence results reveal that CD147, Arf6, and spike protein are co-localized in SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected Vero E6 cells. The pseudovirus infection assay exhibits that Arf6 silencing significantly inhibits the viral infection in Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells, while little change is observed in CD147 knockout-Vero E6 cells. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry to the host cells is CD147 receptor-dependent, and the disruption of Arf6-mediated CD147 trafficking inhibits the viral infection. Our study provides a promising patch for treating COVID-19 by targeting CD147 or Arf6.DiscussionTo sum up, both caveolar/lipid raft- and cytoskeleton-dependent endocytosis contribute to the entry process of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, and Arf6-mediated CD147 endocytosis is required for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide a new insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and further suggest that targeting the endocytic pathway of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be a potential approach to treat COVID-19."
Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intent among Latino SNAP participants in Southern California,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created world-wide challenges to healthcare systems and economies [1–3]. As of January 2022, COVID-19 has caused over 60 million cases and 835,000 deaths in the United States (US) [4]. Repercussions of the pandemic including overburdened hospitals and increased unemployment have highlighted widespread health disparities and the need to prevent COVID-19 with safe and effective vaccines.BackgroundExperts postulate 60–80% of the population need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity [5, 6]. However, increasing vaccine hesitancy (i.e., the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services [7]) and growing anti-vaccine sentiment may pose significant challenges [8–11]. Understanding why some groups are vaccine hesitant is imperative to develop effective public health messaging surrounding the new COVID-19 vaccines [12, 13].BackgroundHistorically, Latino populations have lower vaccination rates compared to non-Latino Whites [14–16]. Recent online surveys regarding the COVID-19 vaccine have shown Latino intent to vaccinate is mixed, either demonstrating a similar rate or decreased likelihood to vaccinate compared to whites [17–21]. This is concerning because Latinos have higher rates of COVID-19 infection (1.7x) and mortality (2.8x) compared to whites [22]. Latinos aged 35–44 years are particularly impacted as they are eight times more likely to die of COVID-19 compared to their white counterparts, and six times more likely if they are 45–54 years-old [23]. This increased risk is potentially devastating since individuals in this age range are more likely to be supporting and caring for children and elderly family members. Factors including occupation (e.g., essential worker), lack of ability to physically distance, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and lung disease), and decreased health care access likely contribute to this increased risk of infection and death [23].BackgroundGiven their increased risk of infection and mortality, it is critically important to understand factors associated with Latino COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The goals of this mixed-methods study were to: (1) determine the intent to become vaccinated against COVID-19 in a primarily female, Latino, low-income population receiving aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Southern California, (2) identify factors associated with vaccination intent, and (3) identify key concerns about potential COVID-19 vaccines. Information gathered in this study can help health providers and public health entities optimize their targeted health communication and increase vaccine receipt.Sample and data collection ::: MethodsWe implemented a cross-sectional survey in June and July 2020 to assess attitudes, behaviors, and perceived impact of COVID-19 on participants in the Southern California Nutrition Incentives Program, ¡Más Fresco! More Fresh. (Supplemental File 1) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02976389). This program provides financial incentives to SNAP recipients to purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables at participating Northgate Gonzalez Markets, the largest Latino supermarket in Southern California [24]. A convenience sample of approximately 1556 out of 4500 program participants across San Diego, Orange, and Los Angeles Counties were invited to complete this survey; this was a targeted sample of participants who had already responded to at least one prior survey invitation. A total of 591 responded to this survey (response rate of 38%). Of these, 541 responded to the COVID-19 vaccine intent question, and 486 identified as Latino; this sample was the focus of the analysis. Based on participant preference, surveys were administered in English or Spanish over the phone by bilingual study staff or self-administered online via email or text message invitation. Qualtrics secure online survey platform was used to record responses for both administration methods. Skip patterns and non-responses led to missing data which are noted in Tables 1 and 2. Participants who did not respond to the question about intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 or had missing data from the independent variables were excluded from the multivariable analyses (Table 3). Respondents were given $50 store credit for fresh fruits and vegetables. This study was approved by the UC San Diego Human Research Protections Program as an amendment to the main intervention study and all participants completed informed consent. The STROBE guideline for cross-sectional studies was followed for reporting purposes [25].Dependent variable ::: Measures ::: MethodsThe primary dependent variable was vaccine intent. Participants were asked “if a COVID-19 vaccine is developed in the future, how likely are you to get it?” Response choices included a five-point Likert scale which was categorized into three groups: (0) “definitely yes/likely yes”, (1) “not sure/don’t know”, and (2) “definitely not/likely not.”Independent variables ::: MethodsParticipants reported sociodemographic information including age, gender, marital status, education, children in the household, food security (6-item USDA module dichotomized into high vs. low and very low) [26], and race/ethnicity, which included identifying Latino of Mexican origin or non-Mexican origin.Independent variables ::: MethodsRisk factors for COVID-19 infection included having an essential worker living in the household [27], a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0–29.9 (overweight) or ≥ 30 (obese), or a COVID-19 health-related risk factor. Participants were asked about multiple health conditions diagnosed in themselves or people in their household [27] and responses were grouped into three categories: no health conditions, one or more conditions not considered a COVID-19 risk factor, and one or more conditions considered a COVID-19 risk factor (e.g., asthma/respiratory disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease) [28, 29]. Self-reported ability to physically distance was measured by contact with people outside their household and dichotomized (“less than before/not at all” or “same/more than before”). Prior influenza vaccine receipt was assessed with two questions: “ever had a flu vaccine” (i.e., lifetime vaccination) and “received the flu vaccine in the past season (2019-2020).”Independent variables ::: MethodsTo assess vaccine-related attitudes and influences, we asked if participants used any social media platforms (any vs. none) and how much they were reading or talking about COVID-19 (“rarely/never” or “occasionally/often/most of the time”) [27]. Finally, we used a 10-item measure to assess COVID-19 Affect, i.e., participants’ emotional reaction to COVID-19 related to the pandemic [30] (Supplemental File 1). This measure was adapted for COVID-19 from an existing validated measure [31], and was available for the research community on the WHO website. To our knowledge, the adapted COVID-19 version of this measure has yet to be validated as a single score variable. We calculated Cronbach’s alpha for the 10 items and found it to be acceptable (α = 0.82). Preliminary factor analyses yielded no discernable subscales. Weighted mean scores were calculated for participants who answered at least five out of 10 questions. The third item (spreading slowly vs. fast) was reverse-scored based on inter-item correlation. A higher score on the COVID-19 Affect scale was associated with a lower emotional response or concern with the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on the individual items in the COVID-19 Affect scale are available in Supplemental File 2: Supplemental Tables 1 & 2.Statistical analysis ::: MethodsFrequencies, means, and medians were used to present sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination intent, and COVID-19 related behaviors. Results were stratified by the dependent variable (COVID-19 vaccine intent). Since the dependent variable had three categorical values, multinomial logistic regressions were completed to identify factors significantly associated with participant vaccine intent. Although an ordinal logistic regression model was considered since there is some inherent order in the response categories, the data did not meet the assumption of proportional odds (i.e., the relationship between vaccine intent groups may not be the same). Moreover, the multinomial logistic regression approach allowed the reference group to be set to those who said they would “definitely yes/likely yes” get vaccinated; in this way, the differences between the reference group and those unsure of the vaccine could be compared with the differences between the reference group and those who were against receiving the vaccine. Univariate analyses were conducted to generate unadjusted odds ratios (OR) for each independent variable among those who would “definitely not/likely not” be vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to the reference group and for those who were “not sure/didn’t know” compared to the reference group.Statistical analysis ::: MethodsAll variables significant at p < 0.10 in the univariate logistic regression analyses were included in a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model to determine which factors were associated with unsure vaccine intent or negative vaccine intent compared to those with positive vaccine intent (i.e., adjusted odds ratios [AOR]). In specifying the final model, theoretical justification, impact on sample size (i.e., missing data), and correlation between predictor variables were considered. Lifetime influenza vaccination and influenza vaccination in 2019–2020 were highly correlated (r = 0.55), therefore only influenza vaccination in 2019–2020 was used in the multivariable model. Potential models were compared using Akaike information criterion. The final model’s goodness-of-fit was found to be appropriate in a Hosmer-Lemershow test adapted for multinomial logistic regression [32]. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.Qualitative analysis ::: MethodsParticipants who indicated they definitely/likely would not or were unsure if they would get a potential COVID-19 vaccine were asked to briefly describe their thoughts in an open-ended question. Phone interview responses were recorded by study staff (n = 191). Qualitative thematic analysis methods were used to generate codes and identify themes and subthemes [33]. Two team members (SHV and YE, both bilingual) translated the Spanish language responses into English. They then conducted preliminary open coding on a subset (approximately 25%) of responses and developed a matrix framework for analysis in Microsoft Excel [34–36]. Two other team members (VPS and KER) reviewed codes, met with the full team to review discrepancies, and made final coding decisions collectively. More than one code could be assigned to a response. The data was recoded (YE) and SHV randomly checked 10% of the data to reconcile any remaining differences. The team then met to group codes into larger themes/subthemes, and frequencies were calculated.Sample characteristics ::: ResultsThe median age of those responding to the vaccine intent question (n = 486) was 40.0 years (IQR, 13.0). The majority were female (93%), of Mexican origin (87%), and primarily Spanish speaking (74%) (Table 1). The majority (81%) also had a high school degree or less and had children living in the household (84%). Almost two-thirds of the sample reported low to very low food security levels. While few participants reported that they had a COVID-19 health risk factor (15%), 72% of the sample had overweight or obesity [29]. A third of the sample also reported that an “essential worker” lived in the home. While relatively few (20%) had never received a flu vaccine in the past, only 54% received a flu vaccine in the 2019–2020 influenza season. When asked about their intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, approximately half (48%) reported “definitely/likely yes”, 39% reported “not sure/don’t know,” and 13% reported “not likely/definitely not”.Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intent ::: ResultsIn the unadjusted multinomial logistic regression models (Table 2), participants with a child between 5 and 17 years old in their household were more likely to report being unsure about getting a COVID-19 vaccine (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.66, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.01–2.71). Those with a higher COVID-19 Affect score (indicating less concern with the virus) were also more likely to be unsure about getting the vaccine (OR = 1.38, CI = 1.06–1.81). Similarly, those with a higher COVID-19 Affect score were more likely to indicate that they would not get the vaccine (OR = 1.55, CI = 1.11–2.17). Those who primarily spoke English (OR = 3.43, CI = 1.91–6.17), were single/separated/divorced (OR = 2.19, CI = 1.23–3.88), did not receive the influenza vaccine last season (OR = 4.01, CI = 2.15–7.50), used social media platforms (OR = 5.56, CI = 1.30–23.82), or rarely talked about COVID-19 (OR = 3.23, CI = 1.79–5.85) were also more likely to report they would not get the vaccine. Those who were older (OR = 0.96, CI = 0.93–0.99) or had a household member with a COVID-19 health risk factor (OR = 0.32, CI = 0.11–0.99) were less likely to indicate that they would not get the vaccine. Significant findings at p < 0.10 included that Latinos not of Mexican origin were more likely to not want the vaccine compared to those of Mexican origin, and those who used social media platforms were more likely to be unsure of the vaccine (Table 2).Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intent ::: ResultsIn the multivariable multinomial logistic regression model (Table 3), participants with a household member with a COVID-19 health risk factor were more likely to report being unsure about getting the vaccine (AOR = 2.43, CI = 1.05–5.64). A higher COVID-19 Affect score remained significant in this model, indicating that those who were less concerned about the virus were more likely to report they were unsure about getting the vaccine (AOR = 1.38, CI = 1.02–1.87). Participants who were primarily English speaking (AOR = 3.05, CI = 1.31–7.12), did not receive the influenza vaccine last season (AOR = 3.14, CI = 1.36–7.23), or reported not reading or talking about COVID-19 (AOR = 4.03, CI = 1.72–9.43) were more likely to report not intending to receive the vaccine (Table 3). This final model was repeated without the variable “received flu vaccine in the past season” and the remaining variables were still significant.Views of the COVID-19 vaccine ::: ResultsParticipants who reported that they were unsure or unlikely to get a COVID-19 vaccine were asked to report their concerns about getting the vaccine. A little under half (n = 191) provided a brief written response or oral response via phone interview (Table 4). The most common theme (51% of respondents) focused on concerns about “side effects and ingredients.” Many were worried about an allergic reaction or that the vaccine might make them “sick,” cause them to “have a bad reaction and die,” or “get the [COVID-19] virus.” Some were concerned that the vaccine might contain toxic elements that would cause harm in the future. A few participants expressed more extreme beliefs that the vaccine included a “chip” that would track them and manipulate them.Views of the COVID-19 vaccine ::: ResultsClose to half the respondents (48%) had a general distrust of the vaccine and the vaccine-making process. Many participants were concerned about the speed of vaccine development and testing, and expressed a desire to wait and see what happens to others who get the vaccine. Overall, there was a general desire for more information about COVID-19 vaccines before making a decision.Views of the COVID-19 vaccine ::: ResultsA smaller proportion of participants (16%) described concerns about “effectiveness” and whether the vaccine would work at all or as intended. Several reported getting “the flu” despite getting the influenza vaccine, so they did not want to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Others reported they were healthy with a strong immune system or preferred taking other precautions (mask wearing, hand washing, not going out unless necessary), so they would not need this vaccine. Finally, a small group of participants (12%) expressed a “general dislike/distrust of vaccines,” and therefore would not trust this vaccine.Limitations ::: DiscussionWhile this study provides unique insight into the views of low-income, primarily female, Latino SNAP participants, there were some limitations. Missing data may have affected our ability to conduct multivariable regressions since participants were allowed to leave questions unanswered or did not complete questions because of skip patterns in the survey. Furthermore, these results may not translate to other Latino sub-groups in other areas of the country. Previous studies have found differences in sub-group analysis among Latinos based on birthplace and education [37]. So while it is important to explore reasons for vaccine hesitancy in the Latino population overall, further research examining sub-group differences is warranted to ensure successful public health campaigns that increase vaccine receipt for a diverse sector of the population.ConclusionIn this group of low-income, primarily female, Latino SNAP participants in Southern California, approximately half reported intent to vaccinate against COVID-19. High levels of distrust about vaccine content, side effects, and the expedited timeline to production persist among this population. Since the time of this survey, more information has been made available regarding the safety and efficacy of several vaccines, and vaccine intent may have increased. As more information about vaccine safety and its longer-term effects are made available, it will be important to disseminate this information to at-risk communities and increase their immunity to this deadly disease."
Proposal for vaccination against SARS coronavirus using avian infectious bronchitis virus strain H from The Netherlands,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has resulted in a number of infections and deaths among healthcare workers (HCWs) and those in contact with SARS-infected persons. The virus, now classified provisionally as a coronavirus in group 4, is highly contagious and treatment of infected persons has so far been disappointing.The first evidence of successful treatment in monkeys (cynomolgus macaques) was reported recently using alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha)4 administered from 1 to 3 days after experimental exposure. This gave only some success, whereas the drug given at 3 days before experimental infection significantly reduced viral replication and excretion from their throats. Lung damage was also reduced by 80% as compared with non-treated monkeys.In a review article on avian infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccine strain H,1 various characteristics of this vaccine were outlined. Here I shall mention the most valuable properties of this IB vaccine so far known to underline the hypothesis that it may be beneficial in people at risk from SARS coronavirus.(1)It has been observed that the IB vaccine H is able to protect against a broad spectrum of different heterologous serotypes of IB challenge viruses.12 These serotypes differ in their surface proteins (spikes-S1) which are responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibody. Differences in S1 of only 2–3% can change the serotype of an IB virus.3 Therefore, it can be concluded that the protection provided by the vaccine strain H is not only dependant on the production of neutralizing antibody, but is also due to the induction of other immunological reactions.(2)The role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) is still not well understood but it may play an important role in protection, inducing specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.2, 7, 8, 9, 10 Thus, the vaccine strain H may be responsible for the induction of protection through its nucleocapsid protein.13 In order to evaluate the importance of cellular mediated immunity (CMI) in protecting against IBV infections more studies would be necessary to explain all the mechanisms of cross-protection of the vaccine strain H, for instance the induction of interleukine 2 (IL 2).(3)The observation that interferon (IF) is poorly induced by IBV and may not be induced by the vaccine strain at passage level 52, could be an indication that IF plays a limited role in heterologous protection.5(4)In a study by Marra et al.6 it was concluded that the SARS coronavirus is a novel coronavirus. Stavrinides and Guttman11 concluded recently that the SARS coronavirus is mammalian-like through the replicase protein, and avian-like through the M and N proteins. They also observed a mammalian-avian mosaic in the S protein. These observations are of extreme importance to the consideration of an avian coronavirus as a possible candidate for a vaccine against SARS coronavirus. In adequately equipped laboratory facilities (P4):(a)It is proposed to use passage 52 of the H strain of vaccine in preliminary experimental studies in monkeys. This passage level has been chosen for its retention of cross-protective characteristics. The vaccine strain H at passage 120 induces only a low level of interferon5 but has lost its heterologous protection characteristics due to the attenuation of the virus.(b)In order to produce a valuable immunological reaction in monkeys with the IB H52 vaccine it will be necessary to inoculate a high dose of live virus vaccine, for example 108 median embryo infectious doses (100.000.000 EID50) intranasally, intramuscularly and/or subcutaneously. It is not expected that the virus will be infectious for macaques, therefore, a high dose will be required in order to achieve an adequate response of the immune system. For more than 50 years avian IB infections have occurred worldwide and there are no reports of infection among human beings, including in poultry farmers or other people who have had direct contact with highly contagious IB viruses of chickens.(c)In the study using alpha IF in macaques the amount of SARS coronavirus virus (SCV) used for challenge was 1×106 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in 5 ml of PBS administered intratracheally.4 However, it was not mentioned in that publication whether or not a prechallenge titration of this virus was performed. It is very important to establish the amount of challenge virus, which will provoke disease and eventually death. Therefore, before starting the experiment titration of the challenge virus in these monkeys should be performed in order to determine the amount of virus, which will produce clinical symptoms in not more than 90% of the infected animals. If an overdose is applied no real effect of the treatment will be demonstrable and if insufficient challenge virus is used no results will become available.(d)It is of extreme importance that the H52 vaccine virus should be free of all micro-organisms other than IB live vaccine virus, therefore, its production and passage in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs is a prerequisite.(e)It is proposed to challenge the vaccinated monkeys at 2 and 14 days after vaccination with a challenge SCV which has been titrated in macaques (see point c). This proposal is based on the likely immediate effect of the vaccine at 2 days through immunostimulation mechanisms and at 2 weeks, if protection is observed, through the heterologous cross-protective activity of the vaccine virus. It is without question that careful consideration by the relevant official health authorities must be given before an animal live virus vaccine is applied to human beings.The application of the IB vaccine strain H in humans should be restricted and only HCWs and other persons at risk but not yet showing any signs of the disease will be considered as candidates for vaccination. If clinical symptoms are observed other methods of treatment, such as administration of alpha IF are recommended."
"Exploring community perceptions, attitudes and practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan","By 29 June 2020, the failure to control the COVID-19 outbreak had resulted in 182 277 425 COVID-19 cases and 3 947 643 deaths worldwide.1 As of 29 July 2021, Pakistan has recorded more than 956 392 COVID-19 cases with 22 254 deaths.2 On 26 February 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was reported from Karachi.3 The cases increased exponentially since the lockdown was lifted in late May and June, 2020.4 The uptick in cases was perhaps due to the Eid festival which happened in late May 2020. Many awareness campaigns were initiated for the general population by both local and federal governments in Pakistan to spread awareness about the risks, signs and symptoms of COVID-19. One of the campaigns involved spreading awareness to the masses through text messages, which were sent by the government of Pakistan on all mobile networks. In addition, recorded voice messages in various local languages including Urdu, Pashto and Sindhi were used as caller tunes before every phone call to warn against the risks of COVID-19, its spread, and complications to help control the COVID-19 spread.The Government of Pakistan has been facing difficulty to contain the surge of COVID-19 due to the country’s social, political, economical and cultural context. The increased resistance by communities and local and religious leaders has made it even more challenging to slow down the spread of COVID-19.6 There have been many generalised and subjective explanations of community interactions with COVID-19 and its control activities. In Pakistan, the initial response of the communities to the rising threat of COVID-19 was that of a generally reported apathy and indifference.7 Despite several public health messages by health ministry,8 communities are not adhering to the infection control precautions which are regularly reinforced through mainstream media. The non-cooperative attitude displayed by the public has further fuelled the rapid transmission of the disease across the country.9 Community practices, and attitudes towards COVID-19 have been described as barriers to an effective response.10 Experiences from the previous epidemic suggest that community perceptions, social norms and cultural practices can impede the containment of COVID-19.11 The fight against Ebola in Africa was subjected to similar challenges.A large body of evidence supports the value of qualitative methods in epidemic and pandemic research. Leading global health agencies like the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using qualitative methods in epidemiological investigations to capture social responses to the pandemic.13 So far various quantitative studies have been conducted on COVID-19 to study the epidemiology of the disease. However, these studies are not well suited to capture the social implications of disease including the reasons for individuals’ behaviour, the social connections or the ways families make sense of what is happening around them. Qualitative lessons from recent epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 and Ebola virus disease11 highlight how to engage with the social, cultural and political facets of the epidemic to build effective interventions. To understand social responses towards COVID-19, it is important to explore the understanding of COVID-19 and the acceptance of control measures among the community. Given the significance of qualitative inquiry, the current situation in Karachi, Pakistan demands an exploration of community perceptions, attitudes, practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The open-ended nature of the study will help focus on how individuals and communities perceive COVID-19 disease.Study design and setting ::: MethodsThis study used an exploratory qualitative research design using a purposive sampling approach. The study was conducted in two muslim communities of Karachi city. These include Karimabad Federal B Area Block 3 Gulberg Town, and Garden East and Garden West area of Karachi city.Study design and setting ::: MethodsKarimabad is a neighbourhood in the Karachi Central district of Karachi, Pakistan. It is situated in the south of Gulberg Town bordering Liaquatabad, Gharibabad and Federal B. Area. The population of this neighbourhood is predominantly Ismailis. People living here belong mostly to the middle class to the lower middle class. It is also known for its wholesale market for sports goods and stationery. Garden is an upmarket neighbourhood, which is in the Karachi South district of Karachi, Pakistan. It is subdivided into two neighbourhoods: Garden East and Garden West. It is the residential area around the Karachi Zoological Gardens; hence, it is popularly known as the ‘Garden’ area. The population of Garden used to be primarily Ismaili and Goan Catholic but has seen increasing numbers of Memons, Pashtuns and Baloch. These areas have been selected purposively to interview members of these communities.Study design and setting ::: MethodsThis design did not intend to look at the differences between the two neighbourhoods with regard to perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 but rather to understand how community members in Karachi, Pakistan perceive COVID-19 disease and its precautionary measures.Data collection methods and study participants ::: MethodsThe data collection methods included in-depth interviews (IDIs) with community members. The IDIs aimed to explore community perceptions, attitudes, practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan. Adult community members of different ages and both genders who have not contracted the COVID-19 disease were purposively recruited from both sites, as mentioned in below table 1.Data collection methods and study participants ::: MethodsSince this study aimed to explore general community perceptions, attitudes, practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were excluded if they or their family members have been tested positive for COVID-19 or have been isolated/quarantined because of recent exposure. Because COVID-19 survivors and their family members might have different perceptions compared with the general community.Data collection procedure ::: MethodsA semi-structured interview guide was developed for conducting IDIs (online supplemental file 1). The interview guide included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, community knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards COVID-19, community practices to prevent exposure from COVID-19, perceived risks associated with poor adherence to safety measures, and perceptions on future preparedness for the second wave of COVID-19. The interview guides were pilot tested with a non-study sample (2 IDIs) with the same characteristics as the study sample. The pilot testing offered evidence-based guidance to improve data collection guides.Data collection procedure ::: MethodsThe IDI participants were identified and contacted via the pre-existing community WhatsApp and email groups. The researchers obtained access to these groups through community leaders of both neighbourhoods. The community leaders, gatekeepers in this study, supported the identification of a purposive sample through both communities. A total of 35 eligible individuals were contacted through these groups, out of which 27 agreed to participate in the study. Interviews were scheduled for participants’ convenient day and time. Before beginning the interview, the study investigators explained the study objectives and procedures to eligible community members and obtained informed consent for their participation in the study. Informed consent was also obtained on either email or WhatsApp, for notetaking and audio recording of the interviews. Participants who were unable to write their names were asked to provide a thumbprint on the consent form to symbolise their consent to participate. Trained researchers, experienced in qualitative research, conducted online interviews via Zoom or Skype. At the start of the interview, each participant was asked to provide sociodemographic details including age, gender, educational level and occupation. The interviews were conducted in the languages of English and/or Urdu. Each interview took around 30–40 min in duration. Study participants were assured that their information will remain confidential, and no identifying features will be mentioned on the transcript.Data collection procedure ::: MethodsData collection was ceased once saturation was achieved; saturation refers to the point in the research process when no new information is discovered in data analysis.14 The sample size was not predetermined, and an iterative approach of simultaneous data collection and analysis was taken to determine the point of data saturation. Data saturation refers to the point in the research process when no new information is discovered in data analysis and this redundancy signals to researchers that data collection may cease. Study data were analysed manually using the conventional content analysis technique.16 First, the audio recordings from the interviews were transcribed and then translated into the English language. No identifying characteristics were included in the transcriptions. Transcripts were read several times by research investigators to develop an interpretation of the community perceptions, attitudes, practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. This involved an iterative process where data were coded, compared, contrasted and refined to generate emergent themes by two independent investigators. The transcribed text was divided into ‘meaning units’ which were later shortened and labelled with a ‘code’ without losing the study context. Codes were then analysed and grouped into similar categories. In the final step, similar categories were assembled under subthemes and main themes.Patient and public involvement ::: MethodsPatient public involvement is a relatively new concept in Pakistan. Our data collection tool was piloted through two IDIs to ensure that it is inclusive and comprehensive. We will also engage them in disseminating the findings of this study, particularly their contribution while developing research briefs in plain language and communicating them to community members will be very valuable.Community knowledge and perceptions around COVID-19 ::: Themes ::: ResultsMixed responses were received for the question on community members’ knowledge on COVID-19. Community members shared that initially they had no knowledge about COVID-19 but with time they were able to acquire fairly good knowledge about this virus in general and its signs and symptoms, since it was first identified in Wuhan, China. Highlighting this point, one respondent stated:Community knowledge and perceptions around COVID-19 ::: Themes ::: ResultsParticipants stated that they are updating their knowledge continuously through certificate courses, journal publications, news, social media and so on.Community knowledge and perceptions around COVID-19 ::: Themes ::: ResultsA few community members verbalised that initially, they were so curious to know about COVID-19 but now they have been avoiding reading about it because it causes a lot of anxiety and stress. Commenting on the negative consequences of too much information, one female community member stated:Trusted and preferred sources of health information ::: Themes ::: ResultsWhen asked about their understanding of trusted sources of information, participants listed several trusted sources including, news channels, information from government authorities, webinar sessions by different hospitals, information from community-based groups, WHO website, updates from relatives and friends working in the medical field, electronic media, research journals and so on.Trusted and preferred sources of health information ::: Themes ::: ResultsHowever, a few community members raised concerns about the authenticity of the information available on electronic and social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on. This point was illustrated by a respondent who stated:Trusted and preferred sources of health information ::: Themes ::: ResultsSome community members mentioned that they prefer to gain information from close friends and relatives who are working in hospitals and are directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19. Others mentioned that their preferred information sources include social media (WhatsApp groups, Instagram), news channels, mainstream media, guidelines from community-based institutions and religious institutions, Aga Khan University hospital sessions and self-study research through WHO and CDC websites and so on.Trusted and preferred sources of health information ::: Themes ::: ResultsExpressing similar concerns, a female community member stated:Initial thoughts and feelings towards COVID-19 pandemic ::: Themes ::: ResultsThe research participants described initial thoughts and feeling towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Most community members perceived a sense of shock and chaos in the initial days because all were quickly shut down from schools, public places, markets to religious places. Further participants expressed the feeling of confusion, depression and anxiety.Initial thoughts and feelings towards COVID-19 pandemic ::: Themes ::: ResultsOn the other hand, few participants mentioned that the initial days were fun as many of them got the opportunity to unwind themselves from busy routines, but after a couple of days, the change felt drastic, shocking and difficult to contain.Initial thoughts and feelings towards COVID-19 pandemic ::: Themes ::: ResultsA few community members indicated that they were initially confused about the overall situation and were trying to figure out whether COVID-19 is a hype or a real danger. The participants verbalised that it took some time to internalise the new normal as it filtered down to them.Community practices to prevent exposure from COVID-19 ::: Themes ::: ResultsSeveral preventive strategies were mentioned by community members to prevent exposure to COVID-19. These include social distancing, staying at home, hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand rubs, steam inhalation and frequent use of the antiseptic spray for disinfection purposes. Many community members mentioned that they make Dettol spray for disinfecting utensils, door handles and other miscellaneous items that are purchased from markets on a routine basis. Also, participants verbalised that they wear masks and gloves if they plan to go outside for groceries or any other necessary task. On return, they wash their hands, take shower and disinfect all their stuff to prevent exposure to infection.Community practices to prevent exposure from COVID-19 ::: Themes ::: ResultsA few community members stated that they have allocated separate rooms and utensils for family members who are working in a hospital setting.Perceived risks associated with poor adherence to infection control practices ::: Themes ::: ResultsMost respondents reported that there will be an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases as a result of poor adherence to infection control practices. In particular, community members notified that the younger generation may inflict damage in the community due to their poor adherence to precautionary measures.Perceived risks associated with poor adherence to infection control practices ::: Themes ::: ResultsBesides, participants highlighted that during the Eid festival, individuals were observed not to follow standard precautions which may result in huge losses. A few participants stated that each member of the community should ensure their social responsibility by wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing and following other standard operating measures (SOPs) set by community leaders.Future preparedness of community to avoid the second wave of the outbreak ::: Themes ::: ResultsWhen asked about community preparedness to prevent the second wave of outbreak, several participants suggested that drills and training should be organised for communities to ensure better preparedness.Future preparedness of community to avoid the second wave of the outbreak ::: Themes ::: ResultsAlso, members of the community recommended that the role of community nursing, basic health units, and community health centres should be recognised to adequately respond to the second wave of COVID-19. Alongside this, community members suggested that the government should ensure strict compliance to SOPs through regulatory reforms. Finally, members recommended that the community should do fundraising activities to ensure fund allocation for underserved individuals.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore community perceptions, attitudes, practices regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Karachi, Pakistan. The study investigated initial thoughts and feelings of the community towards COVID-19, community knowledge around COVID-19, trusted sources of information and preferred communication channels, current community practices to prevent exposure, perceived risks associated with poor adherence to safety measures and future preparedness of the community to avoid second COVID-19 wave.DiscussionIn general, study participants in our research had a fairly good level of knowledge about COVID-19, its spread and prevention techniques. Our study participants acquired knowledge about disease via several sources including, certificate courses, journal publications, news and social media. These findings are generally consistent with the results of the study conducted on Egyptian adults, in which participants gained a good general knowledge of the disease, its methods of spread and prevention via several novel channels including, social media platforms.17 Concurrently, a few members of the community showed reluctance to obtain new knowledge as it tends to generate anxiety and stress among them. The reluctance among community members was also apparent in a study conducted with the Indian population, where nearly half the participants felt panic after reading reports of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronic and print media over the past week. When we asked participants about trusted and preferred sources of information to learn about COVID-19, participants listed several trusted sources including electronic media, print media, mainstream media, social media and so on. The preferred sources of information also indicated internet literacy in the community members, to some extent. Another interesting and unique finding is that participants preferred receiving information from religious institutions and relatives and friends working in hospital facilities. Participants also indicated that although these sources provide a simple and accessible way of being informed, they can also be a cause of misinformation. Abdelhafiz et al study reported one such example of misinformation, where Facebook disseminated fake news about the drug, hydroxychloroquine and its potential to treat patients with COVID-19. This fake information encouraged a lot of individuals to keep stock of this drug, leading to a shortage of this medicine.17 Thus, these sources of information should be used with caution, to avoid the spread of fabricated data, rumours and unauthentic information.17 Future research is needed to study the impact of the misinformation that is received from religious institutions, relatives and friends working in hospital facilities.DiscussionIn our study, most participants perceived a sense of shock and chaos in the initial days of the pandemic because of the lockdown and closure of all routine activities. Participants expressed a feeling of confusion, depression and anxiety as a result of unexpected turmoil. Similar thoughts and emotions have been reported by many others in COVID-19 studies conducted in China, where participants perceived COVID-19 as a life-threatening danger.19 20 Alternatively, few participants enjoyed the initial lockdown days as it provided them an opportunity to reset their lives. Interestingly, a few community members believed that media has created artificial hype or hysteria around the new virus for some potential gain. This finding is interesting as it reflects the growing awareness of the community regarding COVID-19 and highlights the cons of using social media platforms as a trusted source of information. The outbreak of the Swine influenza also linked the virus with media hype.21 The COVID-19 pandemic has already seen a rise in conspiracy theories, fake news and misinformation. Therefore, it is hard for communities to distinguish scientific evidence and facts from less reliable sources of information.22 The Nature Medicine article clarified that the virus is not purposefully manipulated or created in laboratories.23 Our study found that participants needed adequate time to internalise the new normal as it filtered down to them. Thus, a systemic resilience approach is essential to deal with a sense of shock and drastic change associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.Our results undoubtedly show that participants have a positive general attitude towards safety measures to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Participants believed in the value of maintaining social distancing, staying at home, cleaning hands with soap water or alcohol-based sanitizer, wearing a facemask and using Dettol disinfectant spray. It has also been seen in another COVID-19 study that community members are adhering to safety precautions to avoid virus transmission. This indicates the positive behaviour and attitude of the community towards COVID-19, as a result of better community sensitisation.18 A unique yet encouraging finding reported by our study was that the community members allocated separate rooms and utensils for family members who are working in a hospital setting. This indicates that most participants in our study had adequate awareness of safety measures for preventing exposure to COVID-19.DiscussionCommenting on the perceived risk associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, the majority of the participants in this study expressed a high level of susceptibility in contracting COVID-19 as a result of poor adherence to safety measures by some community members. Our study participants notified that the younger generation may inflict damage in the community as safety precautions are not being followed. WHO also confirms that the younger generation is driving COVID-19 spread because symptoms are often milder or none at all in the young people, and many are unaware that they are infected and unknowingly passing on the virus to others.24 This finding indicates that community mobilisation and sensitisation activities are still weak and require concentrated efforts to raise awareness and resolve misconceptions that are associated with an increase in COVID-19 cases. In such circumstances, it is recommended that community leadership should set rules and regulations to help individuals avoid behaviours that are no longer considered socially responsible.Finally, community members recommended ongoing training and drills to prevent the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A viewpoint by Dzigbedeet al reported that local governments should implement disaster training exercises to prepare for the second wave of COVID-19.25 Such training have the potential to strengthen local response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.25 One encouraging finding of the study was that the members of the community recognised that the role of community nursing, and community health centres to prepare for the second wave of COVID-19. This has also been emphasised by Bavel et al in a perspective paper. Since the COVID-19 crisis requires large-scale behaviour change, the role of community health sciences and social and behavioural sciences is of utmost value to help align human behaviours with the recommendations of epidemiologists and public health experts.the study was conducted in the month of May and June 2020, it provides an initial evidence base of communities’ perceptions, and attitudes towards COVID-19 in an early stage of the pandemic when the communities just start to learn about the COVID-19 virus. The study data collection period observed an uptick in the daily new COVID-19 cases as well as total deaths perhaps due to the Eid festival.26 The uptick in the cases might have influenced the community perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 and community members might have taken stringent measures to prevent exposure during the surge. The community perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 and its precautionary measures may be different at the present time given that the community has acquainted with the current situation. One of the limitations of this study was that all study respondents were interviewed online, to minimise the risk of infection. In online interviews, the authors did not have the opportunity to build rapport with community members over Zoom or obtain non-verbal cues during interviews. Second, due to the nature of outbreak prevention, the study was unable to conduct focus group discussions with community members, which would have provided detailed information about personal and group feelings. Besides, the timings of interviews (May–June 2020) is also one of the limitations of this study as the results would have yielded a different picture if participants would have been interviewed in Feb and March 2020, when the pandemic just occurred in Pakistan. Lastly, this was a short-term study and does not involve long-term perceptions of the community members with this pandemic.DiscussionThe findings from this study will help tailor existing public health interventions to address the social and behavioural problems related to this pandemic. The findings from this study can be directly used for improving community preparedness and response for possible future COVID-19 waves or other outbreaks. Future research should be directed at developing and implementing contextual interventions to improve community understanding and social responses towards COVID-19. In addition, future research could be conducted to capture any temporal changes in community perceptions and attitudes, especially with respect to vaccinations.ConclusionThis study provides an in-depth view of communities’ perspectives and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, community members had good knowledge about COVID-19, and positive behaviour and attitude towards using standard precautions, which is important to prevent exposure to COVID-19. The knowledge is mainly acquired through electronic media, print media and social media platforms, which have pros and cons. However, some community members including younger individuals had poor adherence to safety measures. This may necessitate concentrated efforts to raise awareness and resolve misconceptions through community mobilisation and sensitisation activities. The study emphasises that sufficient knowledge and awareness about COVID-19, adequate training and drills, and adherence to safety measures, are necessary to better prepare for the second wave of COVID-19. Lessons learnt from this study are extremely valuable and can be transferable to community settings in Pakistan that have similar sociodemographic characteristics. However, findings cannot be extrapolated to other countries because of the differences in participant demographics and health system constraints.

Negotiating Safety and Wellbeing: The Collaboration Between Faith-Based Communities and Public Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the urgency of limiting the transmission of the virus led to immediate and strict physical distancing measures in many countries, including Canada. The province of Quebec rapidly put in place public health measures, including a general confinement order, with good adherence from the population. However, as the confinement order extended, the collateral effects of these measures on the psychosocial wellbeing of the population became increasingly evident. The pandemic and the related containment measures, such as self-isolation, quarantine and physical distancing, have been shown to lead to an increase in stress, distress, and loneliness; worsening of previous mental health issues; and an increase in family conflicts (Laforest, Roberge, and Maurice, 2020). These consequences seem to disproportionately affect minority groups because these groups experience multiple vulnerabilities (linguistic, migratory, employment-related, socioeconomic) that may make it harder for them to understand and apply public health measures (Cleveland, Hanley, Jaimes and Wolofsky, 2020; ""Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux"", 2020). Furthermore, while mental health needs grew during the crisis, barriers to accessing help also increased. Mental health services were often perceived as low priority, telehealth was prioritized indiscriminately, and individuals’ fear of infection made it more difficult to access in-person care when needed (Laforest et al., 2020; Reger et al., 2020). Although these barriers impacted everyone, they did not impact everyone equally. Individuals from minority groups who have most of their mental health needs met through community support interventions and emphasis on spiritual wellbeing supported by faith-based organizations were significantly impacted when these resources became almost impossible to access (Cleveland et al., 2020; Madan, 2011).IntroductionReligious gatherings were banned for valid public health reasons: they present a high risk of viral transmission with the difficulty of respecting physical distancing measures in closed spaces. (Hernandez, Scarr, and Sharma, 2020). However, faith and spiritual practices are important individual coping mechanisms in times of crisis, especially for elderly persons and minority groups who may have stronger affiliations with religious groups than the general population. Furthermore, faith-based organizations may also provide frontline psychosocial services that are often more accessible and acceptable to individuals from minority communities (Madan, 2011; Wang et al., 2003). On a community level, collective religious practices play an important role in fostering connectedness and community resilience (Koenig, 2009; Sheikhi et al., 2020). To face adversity, religious communities have sought to reorganize their activities to foster spirituality and connectedness through virtual platforms (Campbell, 2020), as was the case in Quebec. However, some factors limited the outreach capacity of these new modalities, such as technological literacy and structural factors, including access to the internet (Girdhar, Srivastava, & Sethi, 2020; Gunnell et al., 2020). Despite these challenges, many religious people have mentioned that their faith has been strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it served as a coping mechanism in uncertain times (Gecewicz, 2020; Pirutinsky et al., 2020). During the pandemic, international organizations have emphasized the key role of religious leaders in relaying public health information about COVID-19 to their communities and encouraging people to adhere to governmental measures (""World Health Organization"", 2020b). Maintaining their support in a context of the unilateral imposition of measures that significantly limit their actions may, however, become difficult as time passes and the crisis endangers their mission and survival.IntroductionBalancing the risk to the safety of the population with its wellbeing is a challenging exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic because it requires ongoing negotiations in a dynamic, unpredictable and ever-evolving crisis. Beyond the challenges associated with uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered the social fabric of societies, provoking divisions around what was deemed essential during the confinement period. Often, voices from majority groups have prevailed; in other cases, some attention has been given to the specific needs of minorities (Cleveland et al., 2020; Luft, 2020). The processes leading to these delicate choices has not yet been described although some attention has been given in the literature to medical-religious partnerships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Monson, 2021; Galiatsatos, 2020). Further knowledge could help institutions promote a public health agenda while preserving social harmony and protecting the rights of minorities. In Quebec (Canada), a series of intersectional negotiations among health authorities, faith-based organizations, and sometimes police forces were conducted during the COVID-19 crisis in spring 2020. The main aim of this paper is to document these negotiation processes in terms of their benefits and limitations, with the objective of informing the implementation of future dialogues in times of crisis. More specifically, we aim to explore how these collaborative negotiations were established among the Montreal Regional Public Health Unit (PHU), a transcultural psychiatry team (TP), the police, and two different religious communities and to identify the outcomes, obstacles and facilitators.Setting ::: MethodsThis is a multicase observational report describing the negotiations between public health and religious communities by documenting the initiation of the negotiation, the actors, the processes and outcomes of the meetings (obstacles and facilitators) and the follow-up processes. This mediation initiative emerged in a crisis context from a previous partnership between the PHU and the TP, and the idea of writing up the experience as an observational report emerged, as some of the participants expressed the desire to share the lessons learned. As a community case report, there is no collection of human participants’ data and no ethics approval. The process was documented with the verbal consent of all participants, and feedback on the article was sought with particular attention to including the voices of participants from the religious communities. The negotiation processes involved two faith-based communities in the greater Montreal area (Jewish and Muslim) and the PHU. Montreal is a major city in the province of Quebec and was at the epicenter of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada during the first wave of the pandemic. Strict physical distancing measures and closure of nonessential services, including places of worship, were imposed by the provincial government on March 13, which preceded important religious events, including Easter for the Christian communities, Passover for the Jewish community and the month of Ramadan for the Muslim community. Meetings of the PHU, the members of each religious community and other actors were organized remotely using the virtual platform Zoom in April 2020.The Montreal Regional Public Health Unit ::: The Institutional Actors ::: MethodsThe PHU has the legal mandate to protect and promote the health and wellbeing of the Montreal population while addressing social inequities. In the context of the pandemic, the PHU played a central role in supporting municipal and community partners and informing policy-making. Professionals from the emergency coordination center and the ethnocultural response team represented PHU during the meetings.The Transcultural Team ::: The Institutional Actors ::: MethodsThe TP is composed of a psychiatrist, psychiatry residents, psychologists and social workers who are based in a highly multiethnic borough of Montreal called Parc-Extension and have expertise in intercommunity relationships and polarization (Rousseau et al., 2021). The team often mediates between majority and minority groups in socially divisive situations.The Police Force ::: The Institutional Actors ::: MethodsThe municipal police of Montreal is divided into 31 local police stations. Representatives from local stations near where early outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred among Orthodox Jewish communities were present for the conversations with the Jewish community. The Montreal police also has a unit responsible for hate crimes and hate incidents, which was solicited in response to reported intercommunity tensions.Process Documentation ::: MethodsThe interventions were documented via field notes and diaries by observers of the meetings. Three participants from the transcultural team who acted as observers completed a grid for the Jewish community and the Muslim community. The grid has three sections: the initial requests and the organization of the meeting, the process and outcome of the dialogue and the mediation and the follow-up process. The questions are open-ended, and there is room in the grid for reflections and observations. The field notes and diaries were read repeatedly to identify emerging themes and were subsequently coded manually. A thematic analysis across cases was subsequently performed.Approach ::: MethodsThe TP used a transformative framework when approaching the mediation between different institutions and cultural groups with power differentials. They drew from the dialogic approach, first described by Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin (Hermans and Hermans-Konopka, 2010) (Baxtin, [1934/35] 1981) theorizes that a person has multiple inner voices that reflect the many influences that shape their identities as well as the contexts in which they evolve: family, cultural group, religion, career, personal interests, etc. This particular perspective facilitates the acknowledgment of power relations and of personal and collective blind spots. Therefore, the emphasis in the interventions is not only on the content of what it being said. Rather, an effort is also made to understand the implicit meaning in the specific context and the interactions of the multitude of voices, identities and systems. This approach helps create a form of horizontal communication to move away from interactions where one party tries to convince the other of the superiority of its views. The objective is to launch an intercultural dialogue that can lead to the co-construction of creative solutions, drawing on the resilience and strengths of the communities (Broome et al., 2019).Process ::: The Jewish Community ::: ResultsThe first meeting was initiated by the PHU, whereas the following meetings were initiated by the community. The PHU approached the TP, asking them to mediate a meeting where they wanted to discuss in a culturally sensitive way the decision to close the mikvah. The mikvah is an indoor pool of water where observant married Jewish women take a ritual bath 7 days after the end of their menstruation to purify themselves. Immersion usually occurs in a group under the supervision of an attendant. Very observant Jews cannot have sexual contact with a woman until she has performed her ritual cleansing.Spiritual Importance of Rituals ::: The Jewish Community ::: ResultsThe PHU started the meeting by announcing that the mikvah had to be closed for public health reasons and by reinforcing the importance of respecting the physical distancing measures during Passover. Rabbinic authorities defended the spiritual importance of the mikvah and referred to how they were kept open in Israel. The TP highlighted the conflict among sanitary safety, spiritual needs and the prejudices of the host society toward the Jewish community, which were exacerbated by the fact that the community was one of the first to be severely affected by outbreaks in Montreal. The TP invited both parties to find a solution that would be acceptable from a public health perspective while pushing the majority’s position slightly out of its comfort zone by endorsing the mikvah as an essential religious practice. The community suggested ways of keeping the mikvah safely open by having individual appointments and implementing distancing and more rigorous disinfection and cleaning. The community also explored ways of continuing communal prayers by praying together on balconies, thus respecting physical distancing. The PHU agreed that these adjustments would respect public health directives and stated that they would support this position.Experiences of Discrimination ::: The Jewish Community ::: ResultsIn addition to the mikvah, the TP explored the impact of the negative media coverage and of the profiling of the Jewish families. This intervention uncovered intercommunity tensions, and the TP suggested follow-up meetings with the police to address the upsurge in hate crime and incidents and to buffer the profiling while endorsing respect for the law. The police had noticed no increase in reports of hate crimes or incidents by the Jewish community, which the TP linked to possible fear and past negative experiences with the police while inviting the community representative to speak up in order to collectively help restore a feeling of community safety. Thereafter, the community actors described numerous incidents of discrimination and of unfounded accusations made by the neighborhood for what was perceived as a lack of respect for the physical distancing measures. Orthodox Jewish families in the neighborhood have large households, and the number of people congregating made the neighbors nervous. The police would check on the complaints visibly and loudly, sometimes with multiple police cars that further terrified the community while increasing prejudice toward them. This opened a dialogue about the duty of the police to verify complaints versus the stigmatization (or discrimination) the community felt from their presence.Outcomes ::: The Jewish Community ::: ResultsRegarding the outcomes, the meetings did not lead to the immediate reopening of the mikvah, as the government of Quebec opted to maintain a complete ban on all religious activities. The PHU stayed in regular contact with the community to answer questions regarding governmental measures, and the mikvah reopened in June as part of the deconfinement plan. The police made themselves less visible in their interventions, and the community was encouraged to file reports of phone harassment and hate incidents. The community respected public health measures during Passover. However, the discontent of the neighborhood toward the Jewish community and neighbors’ negative perceptions continued and were made known to the TP through a neighborhood collaboration network that is ongoing.Process ::: The Muslim Community ::: ResultsThe PHU considered that the intervention with the Jewish community was helpful and asked the TP to mediate a meeting with the Muslim community in anticipation of the month of Ramadan starting on April 24 to reinforce respect for physical distancing measures. The TP presented the meeting as an invitation to see how the community was impacted by the pandemic and the public health measures and to explore what was planned for Ramadan. Discrimination against Muslim communities was also mentioned.The Multiple Roles Played by the Place of Worship ::: The Muslim Community ::: ResultsThe recurrent themes raised by the community participants were the importance of mosques and imams not only for spiritual reasons but also for social and community needs—to provide social support for vulnerable individuals in the form of food, family conflict resolution, marriages/divorces/funerals and individual counseling. They found the closure of the mosques challenging as some imams could not talk to their congregants without being physically at the mosque, and they wondered if they could still provide food boxes and cook food for the breaking of the fast, Iftar, as they usually do every night of Ramadan. Additionally, some expressed their worry about the financial health of their mosques, as most of the donations that maintain them throughout the year are collected in person during the daily evening communal prayers of Ramadan, considered the month of charity. Many of the mosques had set up virtual religious services but insisted on the limits of these interventions, especially for elderly and isolated individuals. They did not report an increase in intercommunity tensions or discrimination. The PHU expressed concerns regarding the physical presence of community members in the mosques and the fact that such would constitute a precedent vis-à-vis other faith groups.Equity Between Faith-Based Organizations ::: The Muslim Community ::: ResultsThe TP thus proposed framing the response to the community’s demands in terms of three categories: yes/no/maybe. For the yes, the PHU gave the green light to open mosque kitchens to cook Iftar meals for vulnerable people that could be picked up and to distribute food boxes using sanitary protocols. The TP suggested that the community members inform the police of their activities to avoid denunciation by neighbors. For the no, it was reiterated that gatherings were not allowed except with members of the same household and that the mosques could not be reopened at this point. The PHU and TP cited equity between faith-based organizations in justifying what was allowed, a position that was not well received by community representatives. For the maybe, the TP invited the community to submit suggestions on how they would apply sanitary measures to ensure that the activities they wished to resume were safe enough and would have more benefits than harms and proposed that the PHU would subsequently analyze the situation and respond with its rationale. Many imams wanted to offer individual spiritual support at the mosques. The TP validated the key role of the spiritual leaders in maintaining the psychosocial wellbeing of their community.Outcomes ::: The Muslim Community ::: ResultsOne mosque submitted a formal request for small group (5–10 individuals) gatherings at the mosque by appointment for worship with physical distancing. This was responded to with a grid explaining how the risks of such activity would outweigh the benefits. Some members of the community expressed gratitude for the meetings and went on to organize food banks and Iftar distribution during the month of Ramadan. The community did not request follow-up meetings. There were no denunciations from the neighbors or complaints to the police during Ramadan. The festivities of the end of Ramadan coincided with the first phase of deconfinement in Quebec, where 10 people from three different households were allowed to gather outdoors while maintaining physical distancing. This was welcomed very positively by the community.Outcomes ::: The Muslim Community ::: ResultsUltimately, these experiences led to formalizing the involvement of the TP with the creation of a program named CoVivre. CoVivre is a financed project that works on addressing inequities experienced by marginalized groups in the context of the pandemic by acting as a catalyst for actions and partnerships with key actors. These experiences also led to the writing of a mediation guide in collaboration with public health.Study Limitations ::: DiscussionThe absence of decision-makers in these negotiations was an obstacle to putting in motion suggestions from the community that were acceptable from a public health lens, such as opening the mikvah and providing individual in-person counseling. The meetings led the PHU and TP to recognize the importance of individual spiritual counseling from faith-based leaders. Thus, an evidence-based argument for individual counseling was built to continue advocating for the inclusion of religious communities and community organizations’ activities within the governmental deconfinement plan, with some delays related to institutional barriers.Study Limitations ::: DiscussionAlthough some members of the majority community were present representing the institutions in these meetings, it could have been beneficial to have people representing the neighborhoods that were experiencing increased intercommunity tension to work on the underlying issues with religious communities that were perceived to be putting the whole neighborhood at risk.Study Limitations ::: DiscussionAdditionally, virtual meetings posed communication challenges that grew with the number of participants in the meeting. The lack of subsequent requests from the Muslim community may reflect these communication challenges. The community’s participants might have been satisfied with only clarifying some of the rules and stating their needs, and they did not request further meetings because they did not expect to be able to make more gains or because they did not wish to be too visible, having endured more than their share of discrimination (Moreau, 2020; Samari et al., 2018). Follow-up meetings could have helped clarify these hypotheses and kept the dialogue open.ConclusionIn a health crisis such as COVID-19 that disproportionately impacts minority communities, the collaboration process with faith-based communities can provide a voice to some marginalized groups and promote an inclusive public health approach (Curtis et al., 2019; Weinberger-Litman et al., 2020). These collaborative approaches should try to include actors from all sectors, such as decision-makers and representatives of the majority, to build bridges among them. However, these processes come with limitations stemming from a rapidly evolving health situation requiring quick decision making. Dialogue has to remain open with regular iterations and follow-ups on suggestions and decisions. Consultation and mediation can be the first steps in fostering mutual trust between minority communities and public institutions to prepare for subsequent waves of viral transmission and future crises."
The incidence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with critically ill non-COVID patients,"SARS-CoV2 is a novel coronavirus that is currently responsible for the global pandemic of 2019–2020. The infection is associated with a marked alveolar inflammatory cell infiltrate that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ultimately to multiorgan failure. Several studies have also reported evidence of a COVID-19-associated coagulopathy [3–7]. The most frequent findings are fibrinogen and D-dimer elevation, both of which correlate with rising inflammatory markers [8]. It has been reported that up to 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop venous thromboembolism (VTE), and this figure can be as high as 31% [2] in ICU patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to determine if VTE rates are higher in ICU patients with COVID compared to ICU patients admitted with seasonal influenza and to ICU patients admitted for non-respiratory reasons.MethodsWe performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients that were admitted to ICU at our hospital. We included three distinct groups:The COVID group: This included the first 38 patients admitted to ICU during the first wave of COVID in Ireland between March 31, 2020, and April 13, 2020.The influenza group: This included the last 38 patients admitted to our ICU with influenza. They were cared for between February 06, 2016, and March 22, 2020.The control group: This included the last 37 patients that required invasive ventilation for a non-respiratory reason for greater than 48 h, and these were admitted between November 02, 2019, and January 29, 2020.MethodsWe aimed to establish the incidence rate of VTE in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU compared to patients admitted with influenza and the control group.MethodsWe recorded each patient’s background and comorbidities, results of investigations and whether they developed VTE or not. The severity of illness was indicated by SAPSII and SOFA scores. We reviewed the radiological evidence that confirmed VTE or lack thereof. Imaging predominantly included ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, ordered for clinical suspicion of VTE, but some patients were found to have VTE, incidentally on CT TAP, that was ordered for a different reason.MethodsWe also looked at each patient’s coagulation profile on admission and how they were anticoagulated in ICU both before and after diagnosis of VTE. The majority of patients received prophylactic anticoagulation, subcutaneous enoxaparin. A number of patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation for a different reason, for example, atrial fibrillation.MethodsStatistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA tests with SPSS and Stata with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. The study was approved by the hospital.ResultsSAPSII scores and SOFA scores were similar in the COVID and influenza groups, but significantly higher in the control group (Table 1). The ICU mortality in the COVID-19 group, the influenza group and the control group was 21.1%, 31.6% and 35.1%, respectively. It is important to keep in mind that the control group included a vast range of illnesses that lead these patients to requiring intensive care.ResultsMale patients were more frequently represented than female patients in all groups. Mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar. There was no significant difference in the rates of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease between the groups (Table 1).ResultsIn terms of blood results, the COVID group showed a significantly elevated aPTT compared to the other two groups, but PT and platelet counts were similar. Fibrinogen levels were increased above the normal range in the COVID group but were significantly more elevated in the two comparison groups. A significant rise in LDH was seen in the COVID-19 group compared to the other two groups, but no significant difference was identified between the other parameters (Table 2).ResultsThe incidence rate of VTE in the COVID group was 13.2% (DVT 5.3%, PE 10.5%) compared to the influenza group 15.8% (DVT 13.2%, PE 2.6%) and the control group, 8.1% (DVT 8.1%, PE 2.7%). Although VTE rates were similar, there was a higher rate of PE in the COVID group, but this did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). All patients that developed VTE had received prophylactic anticoagulation before diagnosis, and all received therapeutic anticoagulation once the diagnosis was made.DiscussionA large number of observational studies of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in general ICU patients [9–13] have been conducted. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is estimated to occur in at least 10% of ICU admissions, but some estimates are as high as 37%. The incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), however, is considerably lower. Studies report that COVID-19 is associated with increased rates of VTE that have been reported to be as high as 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with the infection. Even higher rates (31%) have been reported in COVID-19 patients who are admitted to ICU [2]. In this study, we found a much lower rate of 13.2%. This may reflect population differences, admission criteria to ICU, difference in thromboprophylaxis regimens or small study numbers. In a large study, Klok et al. [2] evaluated the incidence of DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and systemic arterial embolism in COVID-positive ICU patients. Thirty-one out of 184 cases (16.8%) had a thromboembolic event (arterial 3 and CT pulmonary angiogram/ultrasound-confirmed DVT/PE in 28). Compared to non-COVID patients, the incidence of VTE (28/184 [15.2%]) does not seem particularly high. However, a recent study suggests that patients with COVID who received prophylactic LMWH have a better prognosis [14]. In this study, Tang et al. retrospectively reported the outcomes for 449 COVID-19 patients, of which 99 had received some form of prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin 40–60 u/day or unfractionated heparin (UFH) 10,000–15,000 u/day).DiscussionWe compared our cohort of COVID-19 patients with a cohort of patients admitted to ICU with influenza, a viral illness associated with respiratory morbidity and systemic inflammatory response. The VTE rates were similar in both. Of note, the group with influenza was cared for from 2016 to date, and there was no change in thromboprophylaxis policies in the ICU over this time. We also selected a second control group of patients admitted to ICU with non-respiratory pathology. VTE rates were lower in this group but not significantly so. Of interest, PE was more frequent than DVT in the COVID-19 group, but the numbers are small.DiscussionIn our study, we noted that aPTT levels were significantly elevated in the COVID group, compared to the other groups, who were within normal range. Fibrinogen levels were elevated above the normal range throughout all groups, but there was a significant elevation in the non-COVID groups. These findings are consistent with those reported in another study of coagulation profiles in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU and the ward [15]. Of interest, fibrinogen levels were even more elevated in patients admitted to ICU with influenza and other reasons, highlighting the importance of thromboprophylaxis in critical care [16]. Zuo et al. described eight types of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 patients that may account for the prolonged aPTT. They also found that 50% of their cohort were positive for at least one autoantibody. We do not have this data in our group, but it would be an interesting study going forward and may shed more light on the coagulation profile demonstrated.DiscussionThe limitation of the study is that it is retrospective, and imaging to detect VTE was only conducted in patients if clinically indicated.DiscussionIn conclusion, patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 did have a VTE rate of 13.2%, but this was not significantly different from ICU admissions with seasonal influenza and non-respiratory conditions. VTE still occurred in the COVID and influenza groups despite prophylactic anticoagulation and emphasizes the importance of vigilance for thrombosis in these patients."
Predictors of COVID-19 Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors Among Millennials: Two Cross-sectional Survey Studies,"COVID-19 is a major global health threat, with 155 million global cases and 3.2 million related deaths as of May 6, 2021, including 32 million cases and 580,012 deaths in the United States [1]. Two pandemic time frames are especially pertinent to this manuscript: April 10 to 14, 2020, and April 27 to May 7, 2020. By April 14, there were 1.8 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 120,548 related deaths globally, including 582,594 confirmed cases and 23,649 deaths in the United States [2]. By May 7, there were 3.72 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 263,489 related deaths, including 1.23 million confirmed cases and 73,431 deaths in the United States.Background ::: IntroductionBefore and across these time frames, there were school and workplace closures and stay-at-home orders across the United States, as well as recommendations of preventive measures, such as social distancing and face-mask wearing. In its declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, the World Health Organization labeled the plethora of coronavirus information as an infodemic [3], which stresses the importance of health information. Without effective vaccines prior to 2021, a significant challenge for policy and practical intervention has been encouraging individuals to adopt preventive behaviors (eg, wearing face masks and social distancing) as a means of preventing the virus’ continued spread and the further escalation of negative outcomes. To identify what types of individuals are most likely—and least likely—to adopt COVID-19 preventive behaviors, this manuscript investigates preventive perceptions and behaviors and their predictors, including digital health information–seeking behavior (HISB), political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status.Background ::: IntroductionWith implications for theory, policy, and practical intervention, this study focuses on COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors of US millennials, who have been an especially important population for COVID-19 preventive efforts [4], given their high levels of social activity and tendency to have no or mild symptoms [5]. According to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, millennials are “the core group that will stop this virus” [6]. Millennials make up the largest generational segment in the United States in terms of both the population and workforce [7,8] and are considered digital natives [9], being lifelong users of internet and digital media and the most active and experienced generation in terms of new and emerging technologies [10].Theoretical Basis ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionHealth behavioral theory provides a framework for understanding psychological processes by which people confront health threats such as COVID-19. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) entails two predictive processes: danger control and fear control [11]. EPPM postulates that health messaging can influence four types of preventive perceptions (ie, severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy), with these effect processes determining whether individuals enter danger control or fear control. Individuals who develop sufficient levels of these four perceptions are expected to enter danger control, develop protection motivation, undergo an adaptive response, and adopt preventive behaviors. In EPPM, preventive behavior is an “action to prevent, detect, or control illness conditions” (page 76 in Skinner et al [12]). COVID-19 preventive behaviors include wearing a face mask, staying at home, avoiding public or crowded places, avoiding travel, avoiding contact with high-risk individuals, washing or sanitizing hands, and social distancing [13,14]. Perceived severity entails a person’s conception of a health threat’s seriousness, whereas perceived susceptibility involves a person’s conception of the likelihood of undergoing the threat [11]. Self-efficacy entails individuals’ perceptions that they can perform a suggested response, whereas response efficacy refers to individuals’ perceptions of whether a response will prevent a threat [11].Theoretical Basis ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionWith a basis in EPPM, this manuscript employs the following COVID-19 outcomes: preventive behaviors (ie, avoiding travel, avoiding gatherings, staying at home, wearing a face mask, washing hands, social distancing, and sheltering in place) and four preventive perceptions (ie, severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy). The four preventive perceptions align with recent research that has modeled COVID-19 preventive behaviors. In particular, studies have identified fear and threat components, such as severity and susceptibility [15,16], as well as self-efficacy [15-17] and response efficacy [16], as instrumental in predicting preventive behaviors. Research has documented US millennials’ perceived risk of COVID-19 and practice of social distancing. There is evidence that millennials are less likely to social distance than prior generations, but have higher risk perceptions than other generations [18]. Other research has considered the predictors of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors, focusing on either HISB [19] or political party identification [20]. To advance this area of research, we hypothesize that both HISB and political party identification are influential in the development of preventive perceptions and behaviors related to infectious disease. We also consider the effects of COVID-19 testing status.Health Information–Seeking Behavior ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionHISB entails how individuals purposively seek out health information from media and other sources [21] and is a means to coping with a health threat and emotions that result from the threat [22]. This manuscript’s measurement of HISB is specific to digital access via computer, smartphone, or other electronic means. With the advance of new media technologies, HISB has increased among US adults, with their reliance on the internet for health information rising from 41% in 2005 to 66% in 2014 [23]. Among US millennials, internet use expanded from 83% in 2005 to 90% in 2010, which was higher than for other generations [10]. Particular to internet-using US millennials, 92% in 2017 and 91% in 2019 conducted a digital search for health or medical information for self [24,25].Health Information–Seeking Behavior ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionAcross the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has been a powerful conduit for COVID-19 information. In one study of social media posts in China, it was documented that the public was attentive to such information, especially given that the pandemic had closed off some normal interpersonal communication conduits [26]. During the pandemic, US adults have commonly accessed coronavirus news and other related mediated information. In late March 2020, 92% reported having fairly or very closely followed news about the coronavirus pandemic [27], whereas in early April 2020, 87% reported that the internet had been important or essential to them during the pandemic [28]. HISB is imperative given its documented effects on health-related knowledge, preventive behaviors, social support, and emotional health [29-32]. Specific to US millennials, use of the internet for health information neared saturation (ie, 99.3%) prior to the pandemic, which was markedly higher than for members of Generation X and baby boomers [33]. In the context of COVID-19, one study documented that information receptivity was positively associated with COVID-19 preventive behaviors [15]. Another study found that digital COVID-19 information seeking had positive direct effects on preventive behaviors, as well as indirect effects as mediated by perceived worry [19]. Given this basis in the literature, Hypothesis 1 (H1) states the following: Digital HISB is positively associated with COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors.Health Information–Seeking Behavior ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionThe surveys used in this manuscript also permit a nuanced examination of HISB. While most research has operationalized HISB in terms of a person’s HISB for self, some research has considered a person’s HISB for another person [34]. HISB for self entails a person seeking out health information to address a personal health risk or threat, whereas HISB for another person entails a person seeking out health information to address another person’s health risk or threat. This second type of HISB could entail a person seeking out health information for a family member, friend, or other care recipient. This leads to Research Question 1 (RQ1): Does the relationship between digital HISB and COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors vary according to HISB typology—for self versus for another person?Political Party Identification ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionPolitical party identification entails individuals’ identification as Democrat, Republican, or Independent, as well as their strength of identification in the first two regards and their leaning toward Democrat or Republican in the third regard [35]. The opposition of Republicans and Democrats to one another, as well as the divide in related sentiments and mutual antipathy, has broadened in recent decades [36]. This growing division has been instrumental in the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has manifested itself in public health practices and related misinformation [37] and in the polarization of coverage in partisan news media [38]. Misinformation in the media has led to political divides in terms of what is said by opinion leaders and understood by their constituents, including in regard to whether the pandemic actually exists, whether people should adopt preventive behaviors, whether vaccines are safe, and whether people should get them. In this manner, news and other media content have augmented partisan differences in COVID-19 perceptions and practices.Political Party Identification ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionExemplifying the partisan nature of COVID-19, research in the United States has found that Republican counties have been much less likely to practice social distancing than Democrat counties, with these county-level differences associated with individuals’ viewership of the conservative Fox News channel [20]. Another study documented that, as compared to liberals, conservatives have reported lower levels of fear of COVID-19 [39]. Given this basis, Hypothesis 2 (H2) is as follows: Political party identification is inversely associated with COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors, with respondents who are more Republican exhibiting lower levels than respondents who are more Democrat.COVID-19 Testing Status ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionAn individual’s COVID-19 testing status can be viewed as an indicator of personal relevance [21]. The presence of personal experiences enhances the social significance of related health information and disease processes and can be operationalized in terms of a person’s testing and diagnosis for a disease and experiencing of symptomology [21].COVID-19 Testing Status ::: Predictors of Preventive Perceptions and Behaviors ::: IntroductionAcross the pandemic, the implementation of COVID-19 testing has been important to documenting who has the virus. As of May 6, 2021, there had been 439 million tests conducted in the United States [1]. As a predictor of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors, it is unclear whether coronavirus testing status would have a positive or negative effect. On one hand, it could be that individuals who tested positive would have a higher perception of the relevance of the coronavirus and, thus, may have elevated levels of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors. On the other hand, it could be that individuals who tested positive and did not experience negative results would have diminished levels of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors. Given this uncertainty, Research Question 2 (RQ2) is as follows: What is the relationship between testing positive for COVID-19 and COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors?Overview ::: MethodsTo address the two hypotheses and two research questions, we implemented two empirical studies. For both studies, data were collected via online self-report survey questionnaires. Study 1 examined the effects of digital HISB for self, political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status on four preventive perceptions. Study 2 examined the effects of digital HISB for self, digital HISB for another person, political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status on preventive behaviors and two preventive perceptions. This two-study approach permitted several benefits, including the replication of results specific to the effects of the key antecedents on perceived severity and susceptibility across two separate time frames in April and May 2020. It also permitted the expansion of results to include effects on perceived self-efficacy and response efficacy in Study 1 and to include effects on preventive behaviors in Study 2.Overview ::: MethodsInstitutional Review Board approval for both cross-sectional survey studies was attained at the research university of the authors (Study 1: 5550X; Study 2: 5572X). Prior to the online surveys, respondents were provided with an informed consent statement, which included specification of the survey’s purpose, length, and investigators and an indication that participation was voluntary and respondents could stop answering questions at any point across the questionnaire. Qualtrics hosted both surveys and recruited and compensated respondents. Qualtrics recruits samples from traditional research panels. To guarantee the validity, reliability, and integrity of survey data, Qualtrics checks all IP addresses and implements digital fingerprinting technology. Qualtrics and its sample partners implement various procedures to confirm respondent identity and randomly select respondents from survey panels who appear to meet a study’s articulated population parameters. Crafted in a general manner as a means of decreasing potential selection bias, respondent invitations included email, in-app, and SMS notifications. In these studies, panelists who met the sought-after sampling frame were provided with an opportunity to partake in the survey. After the completion of the survey, Qualtrics created a variable in the data set that it recommended for usage that excluded respondents who refused consent, did not complete the survey, completed it in shorter than one-half the median survey completion time, or did not match the sought-after sample quotas.Sample ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsThe first study used data from a cross-sectional online survey of US adults aged 18 years and older. Interviews were conducted from April 10 to 14, 2020 (N=1014). Qualtrics hosted the survey and derived the sample, aiming to match quotas for the US adult population in terms of age, gender, education, household income, and ethnicity. After excluding incompletes and after Qualtrics adjustments to ensure data quality and to match the sought-after sample quotas (n=393), the final sample was comprised of 1014 completed survey interviews. Given this manuscript’s focus on millennials, the subset of respondents aged 25 to 39 years (N=274) was used for all statistical analyses.Measurement ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsThe survey questionnaire’s item wording for key independent and dependent variables is depicted in Textbox 1 [13,14,25,35,36,40-42]. Instructions across the questionnaire referred to the COVID-19 coronavirus and used the term the coronavirus in the specific questions. Three survey items for perceived severity (α=.87) and three survey items for perceived susceptibility (α=.83) were adapted from prior research [40]. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale as follows: strongly disagree, 1; disagree, 2; neither agree nor disagree, 3; agree, 4; and strongly agree, 5. Six survey items for perceived self-efficacy (α=.88) and six survey items for perceived response efficacy (α=.89) were adapted from prior research [40]. These items were split across two preventive behaviors: wearing a face mask and social distancing. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale as follows: strongly disagree, 1; disagree, 2; neither agree nor disagree, 3; agree, 4; and strongly agree, 5.Measurement ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsDigital HISB for self was measured specific to the novel coronavirus. Using the basic structure of the HISB question from Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, Cycle 3 [25], there was one item that entailed seeking of coronavirus information for oneself in the past month via computer, smartphone, or other electronic means. Responses were rated on a 6-point scale with six possible responses—never, once, several times, once per week, several times per week, and every day—and, with reference to prior research [43], they were then recoded in terms of days per month (0 to 30).Measurement ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsOther key independent variables included political party identification and COVID-19 testing status. For political party identification [35,36], there was a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (strong Democrat) to 6 (strong Republican). In terms of COVID-19 testing status, a dichotomous (ie, yes or no) measure was instituted for whether respondents had tested positive for COVID-19 [41].Measurement ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsControl demographics included age, education, household income, ethnicity, employment, and gender. In terms of the millennial subsample, age responses were from 25 to 39 years. Education was measured at the ordinal level with seven responses ranging from less than 8 years to postgraduate. Household income was measured at the ordinal level with nine responses ranging from US $9999 or less to US $200,000 or more. For ethnicity, a dichotomous variable of White or non-White was created. For employment, a dichotomous variable for full-time employment was created.Statistical Analysis ::: Study 1 ::: MethodsStatistical analysis was conducted with Stata 16 (StataCorp LLC). The internal consistency of composite measures was assessed with Cronbach α. Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported for each study variable. To test the predictors of preventive perceptions, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The dependent variables in the models were severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy. Independent variables were entered in two hierarchical steps: (1) control demographics and (2) digital HISB for self, political party identification, and tested positive for COVID-19. This second block of variables permitted testing of the hypotheses and answering of the research questions. We calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) for the regression models to gauge for multicollinearity [44]. For the regression models in Study 1 and Study 2, VIF levels were low (ie, <2.00), which indicates no evidence of multicollinearity [44].Sample ::: Study 2 ::: MethodsThe second study used data from a cross-sectional online survey that targeted millennials, in particular US adults aged 25 to 39 years (N=1037). Interviews were conducted from April 27 to May 7, 2020. Qualtrics hosted the survey and derived the sample, aiming to match quotas for the US adult population in terms of gender, education, and ethnicity. After excluding incompletes and after Qualtrics adjustments to ensure data quality and to match the sought-after sample quotas (n=80), the final sample included 1037 completed survey interviews.Measurement ::: Study 2 ::: MethodsThe survey questionnaire’s item wording for key independent and dependent variables is depicted in Textbox 1. Consistent with Study 1, three survey items for perceived severity (α=.84) and three survey items for perceived susceptibility (α=.76) were adapted from prior research [40] and had the same Likert scale response options as described above. Preventive behaviors were measured with a 7-item additive index (α=.79), with dichotomous (ie, yes or no) questions specific to the following practices: avoiding travel, avoiding gatherings, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, social distancing, and sheltering in place [13,14].Measurement ::: Study 2 ::: MethodsDigital HISB was measured in two ways: for self and for another person. Using the basic structure of the question on HISB for self from HINTS 5, Cycle 3 [25], the measurement was expanded to include HISB for another person, with adaption from HINTS 4, Cycle 1 [42]. Like Study 1, the first item specific to digital HISB for self entailed seeking of coronavirus information for oneself in the past month via computer, smartphone, or other electronic means. The second item specific to digital HISB for another person entailed seeking of coronavirus information for another person in the past month via computer, smartphone, or other electronic means. Like Study 1, responses were rated on a 6-point scale and then recoded in terms of days per month (0 to 30) [43].Measurement ::: Study 2 ::: MethodsPolitical party identification and COVID-19 testing status were measured with the same survey items as in Study 1. Also like Study 1, control demographics included age, education, household income, ethnicity, employment, and gender.Statistical Analysis ::: Study 2 ::: MethodsStatistical analysis was similar to Study 1, also using Stata 16 (StataCorp LLC). The internal consistency of composite measures was assessed with Cronbach α, and descriptive statistics were reported for all measures. To test the predictors of preventive perceptions and behaviors, we used OLS regression. Dependent variables in the models were severity, susceptibility, and preventive behaviors. Independent variables were entered in two hierarchical steps: (1) control demographics and (2) digital HISB for self, digital HISB for another person, political party identification, and tested positive for COVID-19. The second block of variables allowed for testing of the hypotheses and answering of the research questions. As with Study 1, there was no evidence of multicollinearity in the regression models, which had low VIF levels (ie, <2.00) [44].Study 1 ::: ResultsDescriptive statistics appear in Table 1. Of the sample, more than 64% were White, and more than 45% were male. The mean age was more than 32 years, the mode for household income was $50,000 to $74,999, and the mode for education was 12 years or completed high school. Finally, more than 51% of the sample reported full-time employment. Among the key predictors, the average for digital HISB for self was 15 days per month. Average levels of the four preventive perceptions were between 3.13 and 4.05 on the 5-point Likert scale.Study 1 ::: ResultsTable 2 depicts the hierarchical regression models for this study. The effects of only control variables can be found in Block 1 in Models 1, 3, 5, and 7. At the level of nearing significance (ie, P<.10), age was positively associated with severity (see Model 1), White respondents had higher levels of perceived susceptibility (see Model 3), and household income was positively associated with response efficacy (see Model 7). Finally, full-time employed respondents had lower levels of severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy, with the final relationship nearing significance (see Models 1, 5, and 7).Study 1 ::: ResultsThe regression results in Table 2 also pertain to H1 and H2 as well as to RQ2 (see Block 2 in Models 2, 4, 6, and 8). Supportive of H1, digital HISB for self was positively associated with severity (β=.22, P<.001), self-efficacy (β=.15, P=.02), and response efficacy (β=.25, P<.001) (see Models 2, 6, and 8). Also, there was a near-significant positive association between digital HISB for self and susceptibility (β=.11, P=.07) (see Model 4). In each case, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had higher perception levels. Supportive of H2, political party identification was negatively associated with self-efficacy (β=−.14, P=.02) and response efficacy (β=−.13, P=.03) (see Models 6 and 8). Notably, political party identification also had near-significant inverse associations with severity (β=−.10, P=.08) and susceptibility (β=−.12, P=.06) (see Models 2 and 4). In each of the four cases, respondents who identified as being more Republican had lower perception levels. Finally, in terms of RQ2, respondents who tested positive for COVID-19 had higher levels of susceptibility (β=.17, P=.006) (see Model 4).Study 2 ::: ResultsDescriptive statistics appear in Table 3. Of the sample, more than 63% were White and more than 46% were male. The mean age was almost 32 years, the mode for household income was US $20,000 to US $34,999, and the mode for education was 12 years or completed high school. Finally, 52.3% of the sample reported full-time employment. Among the key predictors, the mean for digital HISB for self was more than 13 days per month, whereas the mean for digital HISB for another person was more than 8 days per month. Average levels of severity and self-efficacy were between 3 and 4 on the 5-point Likert scale, and respondents reported having performed an average of almost six of the seven preventive behaviors, with frequently washing hands ranking the highest.Study 2 ::: ResultsTable 4 depicts the hierarchical regression models for this study. The effects of only control variables can be found in Block 1 in Models 1, 3, and 5. Household income had significant positive associations with susceptibility and preventive behaviors (see Models 3 and 5). At the level of nearing significance, education and age had positive associations with severity (see Model 1). In addition, education was positively associated with preventive behaviors, and, nearing significance, employment was inversely associated with preventive behaviors (see Model 5).Study 2 ::: ResultsThe regression results in Table 4 also pertain to H1 and H2 as well as to RQ1 and RQ2 (see Block 2 in Models 2, 4, and 6). The results for digital HISB for self and digital HISB for another person relate to H1. Support is limited to digital HISB for self, which was positively associated with severity (β=.25, P<.001), susceptibility (β=.14, P<.001), and preventive behaviors (β=.24, P<.001) (see Models 2, 4, and 6). The effects of digital HISB for another person were nonsignificant in each of these models. Thus, in terms of RQ1, digital HISB for self had significant positive associations with each outcome, while digital HISB for another person did not. Supportive of H2, political party identification had a negative association with severity (β=−.08, P=.009) (see Model 2). Thus, respondents who identified as being more Republican had lower perceptions of severity. Political party identification did not have significant associations with perceived susceptibility or preventive behaviors. In terms of RQ2, respondents who had tested positive for COVID-19 reported lower levels of perceived severity (β=−.012, P<.001) (see Model 2).Principal Findings ::: DiscussionOur analyses depict US millennials’ levels of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors. Danger control, the beneficial process entailing protection motivation and behavior change, requires heightened levels of preventive perceptions: severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy [11]. Of these four perceptions, levels of susceptibility were lowest in both studies, suggesting a gap in millennials’ understanding of their potential vulnerability in contracting COVID-19. It is somewhat surprising that respondents had what seem to be low perceptions of the likelihood that they could be infected with COVID-19 given that, across this study’s two time frames (ie, April 10 to 14, 2020, and April 27 to May 7, 2020), the virus was widespread and expected to spread further. Thus, whereas levels of perceived severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy were near 4.00 on the respective 5-point scales, perceptions of susceptibility lagged behind, posing a gap that could be targeted with preventive messaging. Study 2 also provided a picture of whether millennials had performed COVID-19 preventive behaviors. In particular, more than 80% of millennials reported having performed the seven separate preventive behaviors.Principal Findings ::: DiscussionIn addition, our analyses identified different types of US millennials who were most likely—as well as least likely—to adopt preventive perceptions and behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic; in a nutshell, health information seeking matters, at least when it comes to self. Across the two empirical studies, digital HISB for self was positively associated with preventive behaviors and each preventive perception; the association was nearing significance in terms of one of the preventive perceptions (ie, susceptibility) in Study 1, which implemented the smaller of the two survey samples. The positive effects of digital HISB are generally consistent with prior research specific to the COVID-19 pandemic [15,19] and other health contexts [29-32]. For example, research has documented that individuals with higher information receptivity [15] and COVID-19 information seeking [19] are more likely to practice COVID-19 preventive behaviors. The results of our two studies underscore the importance of digital health information in the contemporary media world, where mediated health information is widespread and the technical affordances of digital and social media allow users to search out health information in a manner that is purposive or incidental, unbounded by constraints of location and privacy, and diverse in information content and information sources. These findings are also instructive for practical interventions, suggesting the importance of disseminating credible and purposive preventive information across the pandemic. While there is evidence in the literature of misinformation and its negative influence on COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors [45], the overall effect, as documented in this manuscript, is a favorable one in terms of digital HISB for self. Notably, digital HISB for another person was not a significant predictor of any of the outcomes, which suggests that millennials’ danger control processes are a function of their drive to protect themselves, not other people [11]. That the related processes of millennials are driven by digital HISB for self, but not digital HISB for another person, may relate to research that has documented millennials as being more self-centered than previous generations [46].Principal Findings ::: DiscussionPolitical party identification had negative coefficients in each regression model for preventive perceptions, achieving significance in three models and nearing significance in the other three. In each case, respondents who identified more as being Republican had lower perception levels, which underscores how preventive perceptions are a function of political party identification. The related findings on perceived severity and susceptibility are generally in line with prior research that documented that, as compared to liberals, conservatives have lower levels of fear of COVID-19 [39], with fear considered to be an outcome of elevated perceptions of severity and susceptibility [11]. However, arguably, what matters more is that preventive behaviors did not vary significantly by political party identification. This result differs from one prior county-level study that demonstrated that people in Republican counties were much less likely to practice social distancing than people in Democrat counties [20]. That preventive perceptions vary significantly by political party identification is indicative of the contemporary political divide in the United States and the polarization of news coverage in the partisan media [20,36,38]. While altering the predominant slant of news coverage in Fox News and related conservative media may be impossible, public health interventions that disseminate preventive information via other sources and help build media literacy to depoliticize health topics such as COVID-19 could help narrow the perceptual gap between Republicans and Democrats. Interestingly, though preventive perceptions vary by political party identification, preventive behaviors do not. Nevertheless, given the vast literature that indicates that perceptions drive behavior change, we believe that media can still play an important role in educating the public on politicized health topics such as COVID-19.Principal Findings ::: DiscussionThe results were less consistent when it came to the indicator of COVID-19 testing status, which was a measure of personal relevance [21]. Respondents who tested positive for COVID-19 had significantly higher perceptions of susceptibility in Study 1 and lower perceptions of severity in Study 2. The first result, which occurred very early in the pandemic when testing was not widely available, makes sense in that respondents who had tested positive would think they were more susceptible to COVID-19. In terms of the significant result in Study 2, it could be that respondents who tested positive for COVID-19 considered this infectious disease to be less severe because they did not experience major negative effects.Limitations ::: DiscussionFive limitations deserve acknowledgement. First, given this study’s reliance on two cross-sectional data sets, no inferences of causation can be made. Second, self-report survey data have some measurement limitations, including social desirability concerns. Third, while the sample size of Study 2 (N=1037) is sufficient, the smaller sample size of Study 1 (N=274) may pose concerns in terms of elevated sampling error and attenuated statistical power. There is evidence of this in the regression results, where standardized coefficients of a certain size were deemed significant at P values of less than .05 in Table 4, but not in Table 2. For this reason, we referred to results that were nearing significance (ie, P<.10) in the reporting of results for Study 1. Fourth, dichotomous (ie, yes or no) questions, which have been used in prior research [13,14,41], provide a general picture of behavioral compliance, but not one of behavioral frequency. By using frequency measurement with a continuous scale for each preventive behavior, future research could depict how often millennials perform recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Fifth, given changes across the pandemic in terms of COVID-19 risks and behavioral recommendations, we caution researchers in generalizing these results to other time frames across the pandemic, as well as to populations other than millennials. That said, this manuscript’s use of two data sets helps mitigate some such concerns related to time frame.Conclusions ::: DiscussionIn conclusion, this manuscript depicts US millennials’ levels of COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors, as well as their predictive factors. Understanding these levels and predictive factors has implications for theory, policy, and practical intervention. The analyses in both empirical studies highlight the importance of health information seeking in the face of a global pandemic, as well as the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should continue to investigate related processes in terms of COVID-19 and other pandemics. It could advance this manuscript’s results by using panel survey data to derive inferences of causation and making assessments across later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Covid-19 Infection in India: A Comparative Analysis of the Second Wave with the First Wave,"SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious coronavirus, expanded from Wuhan, China to all over the world within a few months and by the end of March 2020, COVID-19 spread was considered as the first wave of infection. Isolation, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) as a novel etiological agent which belongs to the same family of SARS-CoV-1 and sequence-wise close to bat derived Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 coronavirus strain [1]. To date, seven human coronaviruses have been isolated, of which OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E [2] cause self-limited mild symptoms, while SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for severe respiratory syndromes [3]. Phylogenetic studies showed that the rodent is the primary host for HCoV-43 and HKU1, while bat is the primary host for the remaining five viruses [4]. The primary host is the place where genetic recombination, deletion, insertion, missense mutations, etc. give rise to different variants which may be capable of infecting other hosts such as dogs, camels and humans. In this article, we will focus on SARS-CoV-2, more specifically on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.1. IntroductionProteomic analysis of the first SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan revealed the presence of four major viral proteins, i.e., the spike surface glycoprotein (S), the envelope protein (E), the matrix protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Moreover, 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1-16) and 8 accessory proteins viz., 3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, and 10 were also found in SARS-CoV-2 [5,6]. Structural and biochemical analysis disclosed that the S protein, crucial for virus binding with the host receptor, comprised two subunits- S1 and S2. The S1 subunit (14–684 residues) contains an N-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD domain of S1 has an affinity for the ACE2 receptor of humans and other species. The junction between S1 and S2 has a polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) and during viral infection, cleavage of this junction is carried out by the host serine proteases TMPRSS2 [7]. 1. IntroductionThe S1/S2 cleavage site is the key region for determining virus infectivity and mutations (deletion/missense) in S1/S2 cleavage site generated more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants [8]. The SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan, China, continually modifies itself by random mutations, developing new variants with higher transmissibility and severity. To track the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, GISAID has introduced a nomenclature of viral clades. Although at the onset of the pandemic, there were three clades—O, S, and L—soon the situation changed with the appearance of six additional clades, namely, G, GR, GH, GRY, GV, and V [9,10]. Clade G was defined as carrying the D614G mutation in the spike protein; the other clades, which emerged in September 2020 and spread globally, were defined as follows: GH (S: D614G, NS3: Q57H), GR (S: D614G, N: G204R), GV (S: D614G, S: A222V) and GRY (S: H69del, S: V70del, S: Y144del, S: N501Y, S: D614G, N: G204R) [9].1. IntroductionIrrespective of the clade, SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins are capable of activating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8 [11] at the onset of infection. At the late stage of infection, uncontrolled secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines results in the generation of cytokine storm and associated multi organ failure [12]. However, the impact of COVID-19 infection is not restricted to the physical health of the patient but is also evident on patient’s mental health. Patients suffering from chronic autoimmune diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Hashimoto’s disease experience pandemic-related anxiety and depression and are at risk of insomnia [13,14]. The continual evolution in the viral genome has made COVID-19 unmanageable over the time because of its more contagious nature, and the virus has developed the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies, which has contributed to the surge of the fatality rate (CFR).1. IntroductionWhile the first case of COVID-19 in India was registered in January 2020 [15], it took more than a year to complete the first wave of infection. During the prolonged first wave, India registered a low number of daily confirmed cases/million inhabitants in comparison to many other countries; however, the scenario started changing from March 2021, with the rapid rise of COVID-19-positive cases throughout the country. A comparison of COVID-19 positive cases/day between India and the rest of the world, as represented in the repository ‘ourworldindata’, showed that the first wave in India started in March 2020, achieved a peak in September 2020 with more than 90,000 confirmed cases/day, and gradually decreased in intensity with 10,000 confirmed cases/day in February 2021. Except for few countries including India, most of the other countries/continents witnessed the first wave of COVID-19 before August 2020 while the second wave started appearing in August–September 2020 [16] followed by the third wave in March 2021, which is still ongoing [17].1. A comparative analysis of the number of COVID-19-positive patients in India with respect to other continents showed that India was behind or missed one wave that raised from September 2020 to February 2021. In this article, we comprehensively examined the scenario in India and comparatively analyzed the global COVID-19 dataset to describe clade variation, patient age and gender distribution, emergence of new lineages, and the Government’s stringent policies in the first and the second wave of COVID-19.2.1. Global Distribution of Clade Variations in March 2020–February 2021 (Period I) and March 2021–First Week of April 2021 (Period II)  ::: 2. ResultsIn this study, metadata were downloaded from the GISAID EpiCoV™ Database. We categorized the globally collected COVID-19 patient data into period I and period II, during which India faced the first and second waves of COVID-19infection respectively. Continent-wise analysis in period I (n = 2, 76,049) showed that among all clades, GR was highly prevalent in Oceania (82.8%) and South America (71.5%) and GH diffused in three continents, i.e., North America (61.73%), Africa (34.4%) and Asia (33.9%), whereas, GRY was mostly prevalent in Europe (27.9%). Surprisingly, clade distribution completely transformed over time, as in period II (n = 55,029), the GH clade became the most common clade in Asia (82.5%), Africa (68.9%), North America (61.65%) and Oceania (58.9%). Although the high prevalence of the GH clade in Oceania in period II looks surprising, this is not the case for Asia, North America and Africa, as this clade dominated these continents earlier in period I. On the other hand, the GRY and GR clades were mostly prevalent in Europe (65.3%) and South America (91.9%) in both the periods (Figure 1). Lineage analysis in Oceania revealed the absence of the prevalent D.2 lineage (GR clade) of SARS-CoV-2 in period II, which might be one of the key reasons for the variation in clade distribution. Clade distribution also varied in India with a shift from the highly prevalent GR clade (40.09%) in period I to the G clade (46%) in period II. As clade variation corresponded to the emergence of new variants or the disappearance of prevalent variants, PANGOLIN lineage analysis in these two periods in India revealed that the outbreak was due to the emergence of B.1.617 and B.1.618 SARS-CoV-2 variants, which might be responsible for the variation in clade distribution.2.2.1. Patient Age ::: 2.2. Relationship of Patient Age or Gender with SARS-CoV-2 Clade Variations: A Global Analysis ::: 2. ResultsPatient age is considered as one of the important factors for hospitalization and mortality [18]. Irrespective of gender and ethnicity, older patients appear to be at higher risk of mortality than younger patients. However, in terms of viral transmission, all age groups were equally susceptible to COVID-19 infection [19]. In a recent report, it was claimed that the population under 35 years of age has a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [20]. In the dataset used in the current study, epidemiologically categorized patient data were compared with COVID-19 patient age in periods I and II. The analysis showed that in both periods, three age groups, viz., 11–30 years, 31–45 years and 46–60 years were the most affected followed by the 61–80 years, 81–100 years and 1–10 years age groups. A comparative analysis showed the most affected population was aged 31–45 years in Africa and Asia and 11–30 years in North America and Oceania. However, in Europe, three age groups, i.e., 11–30 years, 31–45 years and 46–60 years appeared to be equally vulnerable in both periods of infection. Surprisingly, in South America, the most affected age group in period I was the 31–45 years (31.23%), though in the following two months it was the 11–30 years (29.73%) (Figure 2A). Similarly, in India the most highly infected patient age groups were the 11–30 years (30.01%) and the 31–45 years (30.48%) in period I, which changed to the 31–45 years (32.03%) and the 46–60 years (30.47%) groups (Figure 2A) in period II of COVID-19. 2.2.1. Patient Age ::: 2.2. Relationship of Patient Age or Gender with SARS-CoV-2 Clade Variations: A Global Analysis ::: 2. ResultsTo test whether the viral clade has any impact on the age group, clade-wise analysis was performed and it was found that the GH clade (currently the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 clade) infected a higher percentage of the people of the 11–30 years group, from 8% in period I (odds ratio 0.3, CI 95% 0.29–0.31) to 34.3% in period II (odds ratio 1.41, CI 95% 1.38–1.49) (Figure 2B). In contrast, the percentage of GRY clade-infected patients in the 31–45 years group was reduced from 37.52% in period I (odds ratio 1.25 CI 95% 1.21–1.28) to 22.85% in period II (odds ratio 0.93 CI 95% 0.89–0.97) (Figure 2B). Notably, children under 10 years of age were affected less compared to adults [21] irrespective of ethnicity and clade. In this study, clade-wise and continent-wise analysis also showed that children under 10 years were at low risk of infection in both the periods of COVID-19 spread.2.2.2. Patient Gender ::: 2.2. Relationship of Patient Age or Gender with SARS-CoV-2 Clade Variations: A Global Analysis ::: 2. ResultsA literature survey revealed that male patients were more strongly affected than females in terms of mortality or disease severity [22,23]. However, with respect to COVID-19 incidence and patient gender, no significant relation has been reported [24,25] so far. To study whether COVID-19 spread was affected by gender, confirmed cases in all continents were arranged depending on patient’s gender in the two periods of this study; no increased susceptibility in relation to gender was found. However, India and the rest of the Asia registered a higher number of male than female patients in both period I (male patients: Asia, 61.4%, India, 64.9%) and period II (male patients: Asia, 59.54%, India, 71.09%). Interestingly, COVID-19 spread in Oceania showed no significant relationship to gender in period I (female patients, 51.9%, male patients, 48.08%) but the percentage of male patients was higher (73.68%) than that of the female patients (26.3%) in period II (Figure 3A). To understand these changes, PANGOLIN lineages were studied and it was found that the new lineage B.1.466.2 infected preferentially the Oceanian male population (n = 19) than the female (n = 1) population but infected equally males and females in the Asian community. Therefore, more information may be required for any further conclusion.2.2.2. Patient Gender ::: 2.2. Relationship of Patient Age or Gender with SARS-CoV-2 Clade Variations: A Global Analysis ::: 2. ResultsTo identify any relationship between clades and COVID-19 patient gender, a clade-wise analysis was performed. A dataset analysis showed no significant relationship between G, GH, and GR with patient gender in both periods. However, the male population was more likely to be susceptible to the GRY (odds ratio 1.83 CI 95% 1.78–1.88) and GV clades (odds ratio 1.71 CI 95% 1.66–1.75) in period I as compared to period II (GRY: odds ratio 0.85 CI 95% 0.82–0.88; GV: odds ratio 1.05 CI 95% 0.94–1.18) (Figure 3B).2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis of the First and Second Waves of COVID-19 Infection in India ::: 2. ResultsTo determine the route of evolution of the highly infective SARS-CoV-2 variants, whole-genome sequences of 10 highly prevalent variants in the first wave of infection (B.1.36, B.1.1.306, B.1, B.1.36.29, B.1.1, B.1.1.216, B.1.617.1, B.1.1.326, B.1.36.8, B.6) and 10 highly prevalent variants in the second wave of infection in India (B.1.617.2, B.1.617.1, B.1.17, B.1, B.1.617.3, B.1.36.29, B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.1.306) were downloaded from the GISAID repository and analyzed by the MEGA-X software. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 variants of the GH and GR clades were highly prevalent in the first wave of infection. However, in the second wave of infection, the G clade infected the Indian population at a higher rate as compared to the GH and GR clades. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that B.1.617.1, present in both the waves, was the evolutionary ancestor of B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 (Figure 4) and might be responsible for the variation in clade distribution in India from the GR clade to the G clade, as shown in Figure 1.2.4. Current Scenario (April 2021–May 2021) in India ::: 2. ResultsIn India, COVID-19-positive cases increased and touched a peak during the period of April–May 2021. However, in comparison to the rate of infection, the number of deaths/million Indian inhabitants is not alarming. As the emergence of highly propagating SARS-CoV-2 lineages may contribute to the rise of COVID-19 cases, it is essential to study the appearance of new variants and clades in April–May 2021 in India. Analysis using the COVID-19 CoV genetic tool (COVID-19 CG), an open-source tool for visualizing GISAID SARS-CoV-2 data, showed a sudden increase of infections due to the G clade (82.34%) in the period of April–May 2021 (Figure 5A). The spread of the G clade corresponded to the outbreak of the new variant carrying the D614G spike mutation, which is capable of infecting people at a higher transmission rate than other clade variants. Lineage analysis showed that in this period, B.1.617.2 (52%) and B.1.617.1 (17.96%) were the two prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants in India (Figure 5B).2.4. Current Scenario (April 2021–May 2021) in India ::: 2. ResultsIn Table 1, we listed the nine most prevalent variants in India and studied their mutation status. Among these, the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 variants were most prevalent in India compared to the rest of the World. Analysis based on an available public resource (https://outbreak.info/situation-reports, accessed on 27 May 2021) showed that B.1.617.2 has mutations in ORF1b, S, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8, M and N genes, as shown in Table 1. Location-wise analysis showed that the prevalence of the B.1.617.2 lineage in India was 14% as compared to 1% worldwide. Similarly, B.1.617.1 has mutations in ORF1b, S, ORF3a, ORF7a and N genes and this lineage has been highly prevalent in India (19%) in comparison to the World (5%) [26].2.5. Government Stringent Policies ::: 2. ResultsThe emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the second wave of infection may be considered as a predominant reason for the rising of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the Indian community as compared to the first wave. The implementation of Government’s stringent policies was another key factor for COVID-19 case management in both periods I and II. To track the transmission of infectious diseases, a real-time reproduction number (Rt) is calculated depending on the number of cases. Rt > 1 indicates that the infection transmission is progressing exponentially [27]. During the first wave, nearly all countries’ governments calculated the Rt on a daily basis to follow up viral transmission and implement stringent policies. Near all countries except Sweden and Japan, implemented partial or full lockdown on the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Lockdown has several positive effects such as (1) it could break the chain of the exponential increase of virus infection by inhibiting the rates of contact between people [28]; (2) provided time to strengthen countries’ medical capacity, such as obtaining test kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) kit, organizing quarantine centers, increasing the number of beds and ventilation equipment etc.; (3) as high dust or air particulates may act as virus carriers [29], a long lockdown markedly reduced pollution as well as viral transmission; (4) could limit viral diffusion, since as reported, high ground ozone levels and low nitrous oxide levels favor viral growth in summer (April–June), a time when India was under full lockdown [30]. 2.5. Government Stringent Policies ::: 2. ResultsA detailed description of the lockdown and the unlock phases in India is presented in Figure 6. With the onset of the first wave in India, the Government imposed a lockdown all over the country in four phases, i.e., Phase 1: 25 March–14 April 2020, Phase 2: 15 April–3 May 2020, Phase 3: 4 May–17 May 2020, Phase 4: 18 May–31 May 2020. The lockdown was gradually withdrawn in several steps to balance the need to provide safety from the virus and restore the economic growth of the country. Lockdown withdrawal phases were as follows: Unlock 1.0: 30 May–8 June 2020, Unlock 2.0: 1 July–31 July 2020, Unlock 3.0: August 2020, Unlock4.0: September 2020, Unlock 5.0: October 2020, Unlock 6.0: November 2020, Unlock 7.0: December2020. Over time, India started experiencing a low number of CODID-19-positive cases and during February 2021, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases/day was very low, which indicated that the first wave of COVID-19 was close to an end. However, the unexpected sharp rise of confirmed cases towards the end of March 2021 indicated the initiation of the second wave in India. State-wide lockdown was found beneficial for managing COVID-19 confirmed cases in the second wave of infection as after few weeks of the implementation of the lockdown, the number of confirmed cases/day dropped evidently.2.5. Government Stringent Policies ::: 2. ResultsAlong with lockdown implementation, early tracing of variants, maintaining strict preventive measures like wearing a face mask, frequent use of sanitizers, maintaining social distance of at least six feet, increasing the number of tests/day, ensuring the availability of test kits, performing timely serosurveys were found helpful to restrict the spread of new variants to other states.2.5. Government Stringent Policies ::: 2. ResultsThe Government of India started to vaccinate the community in January 2021, which might be a key factor to restrict community transmission and reduce case fatality rate (CFR). The government continually encourages the public to be vaccinated against COVID-19, as experts estimate that if 80–90% of the population is vaccinated or has recovered from COVID-19, herd immunity would be achieved. However, there is always a disagreement as to whether COVID vaccines create herd immunity; in fact, continuous viral transmission and variants generation, as well as waning of vaccine-induced immunity are the three hurdles for achieving the herd immunity threshold [31]. The average numbers of daily vaccinations and average daily full vaccinations are summarized in Table 2. A rapid vaccination is the only way to limit community transmission and restrict COVID-19 recurrence in India.3. DiscussionThe goal of this study was to comprehensively analyze the key factors responsible for the sharp rising of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India in the second wave of infection as compared to the first wave. Dataset analysis explored the link between gradual changes in clade distribution due to virus mutations and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants globally. Continual mutations in spike gene, ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3a, ORF8, N gene, E gene and M gene generated different clades (G, GH, GR, GRY), leading to the different degrees of virulence across the world. The frequent determination of viral load in patients and associated clades of the circulating viral strains may be crucial to understand the molecular evolution of the virus and make decisions regarding COVID-19 treatment. Our study showed that clade distribution in India varied over time, with a rise of the G clades from 21.6% in period I to 46% in period II and an escalation to 82.34% by the end of May 2021. COVID CG analysis confirmed that during the period of April–May 2021, the rapid emergence of few lineages such as B.1.617.2 (52%) and B.1.617.1 (17.96%) of the G clade might have been responsible for the expansion of the G clade in India. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the B.1.617.1 lineage evolutionary generated the B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3 lineages in the second wave of infection in India. As the G clade was associated with a higher viral load than other clades [32], it can be inferred that the rapid rising of the G clade in India during period II of infection played a significant role in augmenting the rate of COVID-19 infection. Previous studies showed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 clade L/V was strongly associated with the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [33], severe COVID-19 lung infection [34] and increased creatinine levels in COVID-19 patients [35]. On the contrary, infection with viral clades carrying the 614G amino acid mutation in the spike protein did not increase patient severity significantly [32]. Therefore, the high number of daily confirmed cases but the low number of deaths /million Indian individuals could be explained by the high distribution of the G clades across India in period II of COVID-19 infection. 3. DiscussionStudying the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 clades in relation to patient age indicated that all viral clades infected patients irrespective of their age. However, in terms of mortality, G clades viral infection led to mortality in 37.43% of older patients in 58 countries [36]. The presence of comorbid factors like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, deep venous thrombosis and chronic renal disease in older patients may have contributed to the rise of patient mortality due to COVID-19 [37]. Our study showed that patients in the age groups of 11–30 years, 31–45 years and 61–80 years were at high risk of COVID-19 infection in both periods across the world. Moreover, the clade-wise analysis showed that the 11–30-year-old population was at high risk of infection with the GH clade in period II of COVID-19 spread.3. DiscussionA metadata analysis by Hamid et al. concluded that disease severity and mortality in male patients were higher than those in female patients of the same age [38]. One report explained that this gender bias was due to a dwindling T cell activation system in older males compared to older females [39]. Our analysis revealed that except for India and the rest of Asia, the two genders were equally infected in periods I and II of COVID-19 spread across the world. However, the clade-wise analysis showed that in period II, both genders were equally susceptible to infection globally.3. DiscussionAlong with the emergence of highly transmissible variants in India, the ‘implementation of lockdown’ factor need to be discussed. In India, the calculated Rt in the first week of March 2020 was 3.2 and further stabilized to 1.09 in the third week of April when India was under lockdown [40]. The Rt went below 1 from September 2020 to February 2021, when the Government of India relieved the lockdown in the country. In April 2021, the Rt in India reached 1.37, and this time, lockdown was necessary to arrest the virus diffusion [41]. State-wise lockdown proved effective in terms of managing daily COVID-19 cases, as imposing lockdown in April–May 2021 lowered the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases/day from 400,000 cases on 8 May 2021 to 127,000 cases on 31 May 2021. 3. DiscussionAlong with its strengths, this study has several limitations. The first limitation is that the data derived from the GISAID database do not contain patient clinical history. Several studies showed that diseases like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease may be important comorbid factors influencing patient hospitalization and mortality. Secondly, along with comorbid factors, the presence of influenza A H1N1 and other seasonal coinfections and the type of care provided by different hospital systems need to be considered. Thirdly, the information on the number of recovered and deceased patients in relation to each viral clade was also not available. Fourthly, we did not include asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients in this study. 3. DiscussionCollectively, our results demonstrate that the analysis of viral clade distribution is important to understand changes in COVID-19 clinical manifestations over time. The shifting of highly prevalent viral clades from 1st wave to 2nd wave of COVID-19 infection in India explains the high infection rate per million of individuals. Studies explored that the 31–45-year-old Indian population was infected more extensively in the second wave as compared to the first wave of infection. The implementation of lockdown was one of the most effective strategies to manage viral propagation and helped lower COVID-19 spread in India. In addition, a rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 variants, strict adherence to preventive measures, prompt diagnosis and treatment, appropriate and rapid launch of vaccination throughout the whole population were equally important to restrict viral transmission in the Indian community.4. ConclusionsThe current study indicates the importance of clade variation analysis to understand the evolution of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis presented in this study indicates that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 clade G was one of the prime reasons for the onset of the second wave and associated increase of COVID-19-positive cases in India, which were >400,000/day in May 2021. Besides the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 lineages, a comparative analysis also showed the importance of lockdown in preventing the spread of infection in India. Considering the current trend of the pandemic, India is still in the second wave of infection and there is a fear that the third wave will develop. Only time can tell whether the third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection will hit India, but results from this comparative analysis would definitely encourage to create new and appropriate policies to mitigate COVID-19 severity and manage the second and third waves of the pandemic successfully.5.1. SARS-CoV-2 Metadata Analysis ::: 5. Materials and MethodsDeposited COVID-19 information as metadata was downloaded from the GISAID database (https://www.epicov.org, accessed on 21 April 2021). Metadata of COVID-19 included information on date of collection, geographic location, patient gender, patient age, and viral genome clade. Firstly, depending upon the date of collection, the data were categorized into two periods i.e. period I (March 2020–February 2021) and period II (March 2021–first week of April 2021). Only data having proper information viz. patient gender, patient age (1–100 years), and viral isolation from the human host were included in the study. By using ‘filter’ in Microsoft excel, we screened the data and found n = 212,550 out of n = 850,559 and n = 55,029 out of n = 170,776, which were subsequently selected for the current study of period I and period II respectively. All the filtered data used in this study were further assorted depending on the geographic location viz. Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania and India. The collected data included in the current study were as follows: Africa 8,953 (period I), 164 (period II); Asia 17,724 (period I), 873 (period II); Europe 83,850 (period I), 22,091 (period II); North America 82,969 (period I), 31,429 (period II); South America 8,035 (period I), 419 (period II); Oceania 11,524 (period I), 58 (period II); India 6,438 (period I), 128 (period II). For comparing the changes over these two periods, clades variations i.e. G, GH, GR, GRY, GV and others clades (S, L, V, O), patient age groups (1–10 years, 11–30 years, 31–45 years, 46–60 years, 61–80 years, and 81–100 years) and patient gender (male or female) were further classified in their respective continents or India. 5.2. Case Study of Clades and Lineages in April–May 2021 in India ::: 5. Materials and MethodsTo analyze the current scenario of COVID-19 spread in India in the period April–May 2021, GISAID Initiative COVID CG (https://covidcg.org, accessed on 27 May 2021) developed by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (USA) was used. Setting of clade or lineages in the period of April–May 2021 in India was used to understand the current scenario of clades and lineages distribution in India [9].5.3. Mutation Status of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in India  ::: 5. Materials and MethodsGISAID Initiative ‘Mutation Situation Reports’, developed by the Anderson Lab at Scripps Research (USA), explored the mutation status of nine highly prevalent lineages in India. This data were also used to analyze the prevalence percentages of these SARS-CoV-2 variants in India and worldwide [26].5.4. Vaccination Data Sources ::: 5. Materials and MethodsFor information regarding vaccination in India, data were collected from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/country_data/India.csv, accessed on 27 May 2021). The data were divided into groups recording the number of daily vaccinations/month and that of daily fully vaccinations/month. The vaccination data for January–25 May 2021 reflect the current situation of vaccination in India.5.5. Phylogenetic Analysis ::: 5. Materials and MethodsWhole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in period I and period II of COVID-19 pandemic in India were downloaded from the GISAID database (www.epicov.org/, accessed on 15 July 2021). The sequences were aligned, and a neighbor-joining phylogeny tree was constructed by using MEGA-X software.5.6. Statistical Analysis ::: 5. Materials and MethodsAll the data in the figures are presented as percentages. For evaluating the association of a viral clade with population age or patient gender, odds ratios were calculated. An odds ratio > 1 indicated that a clade infection was more likely to be associated with the patient age or gender, whereas an odds ratio < 1 indicated that a clade infection was less likely to be associated with patient age or gender. Confidence of interval (CI) was set at 95%. All calculations were done by using https://select-statistics.co.uk/calculators/confidence-interval-calculator-odds-ratio/software, accessed on 31 May 2021.

The role of artificial intelligence in tackling COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 The etiological agent was named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy on 11 February 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus of zoonotic origin belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily of the family Coronaviridae transmitted to humans in a spillover event. Bats are thought to be the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 but the other likely intermediate animal host is yet to be identified. The virus is a spherical particle of 70–90 nm [8], having spikes of glycoprotein projecting from its surface that bind to receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on the surface of the cell. These spikes give the virus a crown-like appearance.SARS-CoV-2The glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a furin polybasic cleavage site (PRRARS|V) located between the residues 682 and 685 at the boundary of two subunits S1/S2 that is catalyzed during biogenesis [9]. The presence of this cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 that is observed in avian influenza viruses but not related viruses like SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoVs makes it distinct and has an impact on entry, tropism, spread and pathogenicity of the virus [9,10]. Expression of furin proteases in the respiratory tract, brain, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs of the host enables the virus to infect different organs and also facilitates its release into the surrounding environment in many ways. At present, 249 protein structures and 255 whole-genome sequences belonging to SARS-CoV-2 are available in the public domain.SARS-CoV-2 genomeA recent study suggested a single-source origin of SARS-CoV-2, as genomic sequences collected from different patients showed strikingly high identity and also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 [11]. Its genome size is approximately 30 kb [12]. A vast portion of the genome is occupied by two open-reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that translate into pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are then cleaved to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) like cysteine proteases, chymotrypsin-like, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase and so on. The rest of the genome encodes structural proteins like the spike(S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid protein and 6–7 accessory proteins [13]. Genetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved in two lineages: ancestral S type and other more prevalent, aggressive and virulent L type derived from S type [14]. It is interesting to note that in the early stages of the epidemic, L type was more frequent, but its frequency decreased later and the frequency of S type increased, which can be attributed to differential selection pressure and epidemiological features [14].TransmissionCOVID-19 mainly spreads from human to human through direct contact by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing and through indirect contact route by fomites and regularly touched surfaces [15]. SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable on various surfaces for several hours to days [16]. Air-borne transmission is possible in a medical or hospital setting in processes that generate aerosols. Although fecal–oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been reported to date, it remains a potential route [17,18].Clinical symptomsMost patients experience mild flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, malaise, fatigue, sputum production and respiratory problems. Less common symptoms such as headache, hemoptysis and gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhea and serious symptoms like pneumonia and bronchitis were also observed. Complications like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and secondary infections [19] were reported in some patients. Other lab parameters associated with COVID-19 were low white blood cells and lymphocyte count, an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, infiltrates and bilateral ground-glass opacity in lung CT scans.Prevention & controlIt is imperative to adopt control measures such as case isolation, contact tracing, quarantine to limit human-to-human COVID-19 transmission. Personal hygiene measures such as frequent hand washing, respiratory hygiene, social distancing, use of face masks/shields and disinfection of surfaces can help in reducing the transmission.Screening & diagnosisDiscriminant clinical features like hyposmia (loss of smell) and hypogeusia (loss of taste) can be explored for preliminary diagnosis in telemedicine and mass screening [20]. Specimen samples collected from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs or blood samples are used for diagnosis. Although routinely used for COVID-19 diagnosis in outbreak settings, sole reliance on CT scans can be misleading due to indistinguishable images with other viral pneumonia. Molecular test reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is recommended by WHO as the method of choice for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid for diagnosis of COVID-19. As the false-negative rate of RT-PCR is high, it is imperative to use CT scan of the chest as a supplementary diagnostic measure to confirm the diagnosis. Point-of-care immunodiagnostic assays that detect proteins from the COVID-19 virus or human antibodies generated against the virus in blood samples are also being used routinely to complement molecular tests due to low cost and fast results, but these methods suffer from poor sensitivity and are only qualitative [1]. Utility of these serological methods in public health settings for contact tracing and evaluating the success of nonpharmaceutical interventions has been discussed elsewhere [21]. These serological methods have now received Emergency Use Authorization by the US FDA. CRISPR-Cas12-based assay that provides rapid results can be used in point-of-care testing in the future [22].Screening & diagnosisAccording to recent data from WHO, 13 candidate vaccines are being evaluated. An experimental vaccine developed by the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca has entered Phase III of clinical trials while vaccine candidates from CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and Moderna/NIAID have reached Phase II trials and ten vaccine candidates have reached Phase I/II and Phase I stages. 129 other candidate vaccines are in the preclinical stage (WHO) and many are in pipeline [23,24].Therapeutic agentsSome of the potential drugs against COVID-19 beingconsidered and evaluated are remdesivir (GS-5734), baricitinib, a combination drug ritonavir/lopinavir, Ribavirin®, umifenovir and IFN-β and other broad spectrum antiviral agents. Remdesivir was not found to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients in a placebo-controlled randomized trial of remdesivir [25]. In a recent development, the FDA has approved the use of remdesivir in confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19. As of 25 June 2020, about 1235 clinical trials for various therapeutic agents against COVID-19 are being conducted across the globe [26].AI in prediction & tracking ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI can be harnessed for forecasting the spread of virus and developing early warning systems by extracting information from social media platforms, calls and news sites and provide useful information about the vulnerable regions and for prediction of morbidity and mortality. Bluedot identified a cluster of pneumonia cases and predicted the outbreak and geographical location of the COVID-19 outbreak based on available data using machine learning. HealthMap collects the publicly available data on COVID-19 and makes it readily available to facilitate the effective tracking of its spread. Recently, the role of AI in identification and forecasting of COVID-19 outbreaks by employing multitudinal and multimodal data was emphasized [27].AI in contact tracing ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI can augment mobile heath applications where smart devices like watches, mobile phones, cameras and range of wearable device can be employed for diagnosis, contact tracing and efficient monitoring in COVID-19 [28]. Applications like AI4COVID-19 that rely on audio recording samples of 2 s cough can be used in telemedicine [29].AI in monitoring of COVID-19 cases ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI techniques are applied for monitoring patients in clinical settings and prediction of course of treatment. Based on the data derived from vital statistics and clinical parameters, AI may provide critical information for resource allocation and decision-making by prioritizing the need of ventilators and respiratory supports in the Intensive Care Unit [30]. AI can also be used for predicting the chances of recovery or mortality in COVID-19 and to provide daily updates, storage and trend analysis and charting the course of treatment.AI in early diagnosis ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI was used for the detection and quantification of COVID-19 cases from chest x-ray and CT scan images [31–33]. Researchers have developed a deep learning model called COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), for differentiating between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia based on visual 2D and 3D features extracted from volumetric chest CT scan [34]. Singh et al. developed a novel deep learning model using Multi-Objective Differential Evolution and convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 diagnosis using a chest CT scan [35]. COVID-ResNet developed using automatic and discriminative learning rate and progressive image resizing performed better than COVID-Net in diagnosing COVID-19 [36]. Alom et al. developed a system called COVID_MTNet by applying improved Inception Recurrent Residual Neural Network and NABLA-3 network models for detection and localization of regions of interests from both x-ray images and chest CT scan [37]. Another study used AI-based classifiers for predicting the outcome of RT-PCR results of COVID-19 cases using 16 simple parameters derived from complete blood profile [38]. This may find application in reducing the number of RT-PCR tests in resource-poor settings.AI in reducing the burden from medical practitioners & healthcare staff ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI-based triage systems can help in reducing the work burden of medical staff and healthcare workers by automating several processes such as imparting training to practitioners, determination of the mode of treatment and care by analyzing clinical data using pattern recognition approaches, digitalization of patient’s reports and also by offering solutions that minimize their contact with the patients [39–41]. AI can be used for classification of patients based on the severity of symptoms, genetic disposition and clinical reports in different categories like mild, moderate and severe, so that different approaches can be adopted for handling the patients in the most effective manner. AI in telemedicine can also be used to eliminate the need of frequent and unnecessary hospital visits by distant monitoring of cases and recording of patient’s data in asymptomatic cases or patients with mild symptoms. AI-based medical chatbots can also be used for consultations, thereby reducing the physical crowding of hospitals as well as the spread of infection and thus prevent weighing down of efficient operation of critical care services [42,43]. Chatbots like Clara from the Centre for Disease Control and Zini are providing much needed support to patients in remote settings [44]. A prognostic prediction algorithm predicted the mortality risk of patients by machine learning methods using extracted features derived from the data of other patients as training dataset [45]. A similar approach was used to predict the possibility of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome [46]. Service robots and anthropomorphic robots with AI core can be used for the delivery of essential services and routine tasks like cleaning, disinfecting and monitoring in hospital settings [47,48].AI in protein structure prediction ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI can help in predicting the structure of important proteins crucial for virus entry and replication and provide useful insight that can pave way for drug development in a very short time. AlphaFold algorithm of Google Deep mind employed deep residual networks (DRN) called ResNets for predicting protein structures of membrane protein, protein 3a, nsp2, nsp4, nsp6 and papain-like C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2, which will give huge impetus to drug discovery programs [49]. DeepTracer, a program based on customized deep convolutional neural network, was used to derive protein complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 from high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy density maps and amino acid sequence [50].AI in development of therapeutics ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementAI techniques can boost and complement traditional technologies by reducing the time required in bringing a drug from bench to bed by speeding up lead discovery, virtual screening and validation processes by a huge margin. AI can also accelerate the pace by deriving useful data for drug repurposing or drug repositioning by screening properties of already approved and validated drugs based on molecular descriptors and properties, which may not be possible for a human expert. BenevolentAI used machine learning methods to accelerate its drug discovery program and identified baricitinib as a potential drug against COVID-19 [51,52]. Insilico Medicine has identified several small molecules against COVID-19 using AI [53]. Another study combined virtual screening and supervised learning to identify potential drugs against COVID-19 [54]. Zhou et al. adopted an integrative network-based systems pharmacological methodology for finding potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 from the already existing repertoire of drug molecules and drug combinations [53]. Several other AI-based endeavors including inclProject IDentif.AI (identifying infectious disease combination therapy with artificial intelligence) [55] and PolypharmDB [56] have been successful in identifying candidates against COVID-19. Many machine learning approaches and deep learning-based applications are also being used for expediting the drug discovery process [57–60].AI in development of vaccines ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementNever before has mankind witnessed such a race for the development of a vaccine against a pathogen. The pace of the discovery can be accelerated manifold by harnessing the power of AI. Ong et al. predicted possible vaccine candidates for COVID-19 using the Vaxign reverse vaccinology-machine learning platform that relied on supervised classification models [61].AI in curbing spread of misinformation ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementDue to the avalanche of information, this pandemic has turned into an infodemic. Understanding knowledge, awareness and practices toward COVID-19 by tapping information from social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook etc. can help in devising the strategy to assemble and disseminate timely and correct information for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 [62,63]. Machine learning techniques can be used to identify trends and sentiment analysis and provide information regarding the origin of false information and help in curtailing the rumors and misinformation [64]. AI techniques can further be used for presenting a clear picture of recovery rates, accessibility and availability to healthcare and identification of the gaps. AI can provide the latest updates about the emerging evidence in diagnosis, treatment, spectrum of symptoms and therapeutic outcomes in this highly dynamic situation, which will help clinicians in real-world scenario and help public in overcoming fear and panic [65].AI in genomics ::: Application of artificial intelligence in COVID-19 disease managementRandhawa et al. devised a method for fast and accurate classification of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes by applying machine learning on identified genomic signatures [51]. Wang et al. used ontology-based side effect prediction framework and Artificial Neural Network to evaluate the side effects of Traditional Chinese Medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [66].Conclusion & future perspectiveAdopting a three-pronged approach based on testing, isolation and contact tracing is warranted to combat COVID-19. It is necessary to exploit the available knowledge base to develop effective chemotherapeutic agents against COVID-19, taking cues from lessons learnt in the past during other such outbreaks.Conclusion & future perspectiveAs there is no silver bullet available to cure the disease, we need to hasten progress on all fronts ranging from surveillance and monitoring to prevention and treatment. As this is the third outbreak of a coronavirus in recent times and many coronaviruses are circulating in animal reservoirs, we must focus on deciphering the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and increasing our preparedness by capacity building for preventing future outbreaks [67]. As the current scenario warrants the need for immediate delivery of solutions, response to this outbreak was hugely augmented by various digital technologies and AI [68]. AI was found to be on par with and even more accurate than human experts in COVID-19 diagnosis and drug discovery. We need bigger datasets for training AI models and a legal framework and ethical considerations for sharing data before AI takes the forefront in diagnosis and other areas. Several bottlenecks in harnessing AI to its full potential in the current scenario are availability and sharing of clinical and epidemiological data, computational resources, scalability, privacy and ethical concerns."
Association Between the Use of Psychotropic Medications and the Risk of COVID-19 Infection,"Individuals with serious mental illness are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Patients with psychiatric disorders are more likely to have medical comorbidities associated with worse outcomes and have a higher mortality rate from COVID-19 independent of these medical risk factors.1,2,3,4,5 Among psychiatric diagnoses, schizophrenia is associated with the greatest increase in mortality risk.1,3,5,6 Although increased mortality risk after COVID-19 infection has been consistently observed among patients with psychiatric disorders, some studies have found lower rates of COVID-19 infection among patients with major psychiatric disorders.3,6,7 This finding may reflect a true decrease in infection rates, possibly owing to social isolation, or failure to detect infection among individuals who do not receive testing.8 In contrast, inpatients residing in psychiatric treatment facilities are at high risk of viral exposure and often have greater access to testing.IntroductionIdentifying factors associated with the risk of infection among inpatients with serious mental illness is of critical importance given their susceptibility to severe infection. A study of adults with serious mental illness infected with COVID-19 found equivalent mortality rates among those taking antipsychotic medications compared with those not taking antipsychotic medications,9 suggesting that antipsychotic treatment is unlikely to account for increased mortality risk. However, individual medications within and across pharmacologic classes may differ in their associations with infection and adverse outcomes. Several psychotropic medications—including some first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol10 and chlorpromazine11) and antidepressants (fluvoxamine, in particular12) were identified as potential therapeutic agents based on in vitro evidence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 activity. Clinical evidence to support these in vitro findings has been mixed. Although several studies have established an association between the use of antidepressants 13,14,15 and a less severe course of infection in patients with COVID-19, small observational studies have found no association between the use of haloperidol16 or chlorpromazine17 and the severity of COVID-19 infection. These medications and several other psychotropic drugs, including second-generation antipsychotics, may affect the host response to COVID-19 by modifying the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and through other mechanisms.18,19 Several of these medications are common treatments for adults with serious mental illness, but their associations with the risk of COVID-19 infection have not been systematically examined in this population, to our knowledge.IntroductionThe primary aim of this study was to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection associated with psychopharmacologic treatments among adult long-term inpatients with serious mental illness in a statewide psychiatric hospital system in New York. We also aimed to assess the risk of COVID-19 mortality among patients with laboratory-confirmed infection.Study Design and Participants ::: MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a centralized COVID-19 registry used by all psychiatric hospitals operated by the New York State (NYS) Office of Mental Health (OMH). The study protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board of the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and deemed exempt from the requirement of informed consent based on use of deidentified data and designation of non–human participants research. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.Study Design and Participants ::: MethodsThe NYS-OMH operates psychiatric hospitals across the state that provide treatment for adults with serious mental illness in civil units as well as specially designated forensic centers. Adults admitted to civil units meet criteria for involuntary commitment under the Mental Hygiene Law and are typically referred from inpatient psychiatric units in community hospitals for treatment of severe and persistent psychiatric symptoms. In contrast to the relatively brief length of stay at acute care hospitals, the mean length of stay in NYS-OMH facilities varies from 6 months to several years. All hospitals have nursing staff coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and ensure medication adherence through direct observation while patients are taking prescribed medication.Study Design and Participants ::: MethodsAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the NYS-OMH implemented a centralized COVID-19 registry that included COVID-19 test results and clinical status for every patient in a NYS-OMH facility, including medical transfers to other facilities for COVID-19 treatment and COVID-19–related deaths. The registry was updated daily, with required reporting retroactive to March 1, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of suspected cases began March 1, 2020, using multiple commercial laboratories; as of March 24, 2020, RT-PCR testing was performed by a single laboratory (Bioreference Laboratories Inc). The NYS-OMH made universal testing available to all hospitalized patients beginning May 7, 2020; patients were offered screening by RT-PCR and antibody testing using the ARCHITECT SARS CoV-2 antinucleocapsid protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay (Abbott). This assay has a reported sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.6% for detecting SARS-CoV-2 within several days after infection,20 with detectable antibodies for at least 3 to 6 months after infection.21 As of July 1, 2020, 93% of patients in a NYS-OMH facility had received COVID-19 testing.Study Design and Participants ::: MethodsIncluded in this study were adult inpatients (≥18 years of age) with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, or depression with psychotic features) who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or by serum IgG assay and were continuously hospitalized from March 8, 2020, until medical discharge for COVID-19 or July 1, 2020. Patients who were admitted within 30 days prior to testing were excluded because we assessed medication exposure during the 30 days prior to testing, and information about medications could not be confirmed for patients admitted during this assessment window (eFigure in the Supplement). The primary outcome was infection; patients with any positive test result were considered positive. The secondary outcome was COVID-19–related deaths among patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, as reported in the registry and confirmed in the EHR. Deaths were monitored through December 1, 2020.Procedures ::: MethodsThe exposure of interest was psychotropic medications taken prior to COVID-19 testing. Medication data were extracted from the EHR. Patients were considered exposed to a medication if it was (1) prescribed prior to their index test date, (2) used for at least 7 days, and (3) received via scheduled administration (as-needed medications were excluded). Medications were grouped by pharmacologic class: first-generation antipsychotic, second-generation antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, benzodiazepine, or antidepressant (eTable 1 in the Supplement).Procedures ::: MethodsThe medication exposure period was defined based on the date of SARS-CoV-2 test and the type of test (RT-PCR or antibody). The date of the first positive test result was used as the index date for patients with any positive test result. A positive RT-PCR test result was considered a proxy of active infection, and the exposure period was limited to 30 days. Patients who were transferred to a medical facility for COVID-19 treatment prior to receiving confirmatory testing were also considered to have active infection, and the exposure period included 30 days prior to transfer. For patients without a positive RT-PCR test result or medical transfer for COVID-19 treatment, the date of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG test was used as the index date. Because this was considered a measure of prior infection, the exposure period included the full study period prior to testing (starting from March 8, 2020).Procedures ::: MethodsThe following covariates were extracted from the EHR and assessed as potential confounders based on their known or hypothesized association with medication exposure and COVID-19 infection and/or death: age, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, medical comorbid conditions, and psychiatric diagnoses. Race and ethnicity were based on patient self-report and categorized as Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Latinx, White, and other (including Native American, multiple races, or “other race”) or unknown. Missing data for race and ethnicity and smoking status were assigned to unknown categories. Medical comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision medical billing category codes (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Psychiatric diagnoses were determined based on admission diagnosis and grouped into nonaffective psychotic disorders (schizophrenia and delusional disorder) and affective psychotic disorders (schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, and major depressive disorder with psychotic features). Hospital size (number of inpatients) as well as geographic location were also included as model covariates.Statistical Analysis ::: MethodsWe first used unadjusted binary logistic regression to estimate associations between baseline characteristics and psychopharmacologic classes, with COVID-19 infection as the primary outcome (Table 1) and COVID-19–related death (Table 2) as the secondary outcome.Statistical Analysis ::: MethodsStatistical tests were 2-sided. Multivariable statistical modeling retained individual medications with at least 5% exposure in the study population from psychopharmacologic classes identified as being associated with infection at the P < .10 significance level.22 Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the association between use of each medication and infection using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Three types of ORs were estimated: (1) unadjusted, (2) adjusted for age and sex, and (3) fully adjusted for age and sex in addition to covariates that were significantly associated with infection in binary logistic regression (P < .05). Because patients could have been exposed to multiple medications within and across drug classes, medications were retained in each step to empirically adjust for polypharmacy. A Bonferroni-type correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons within medication classes.Statistical Analysis ::: MethodsA similar approach was used to assess the association between medication exposure and mortality among patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Medications retained for statistical modeling included those from drug classes associated with mortality (P < .10) and medications significantly associated with infection (P < .05) after adjusting for age and sex. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).ResultsA total of 2087 adults with serious mental illness were continuously inpatients at 18 NYS-OMH psychiatric hospitals between March 8 and July 1, 2020; of these 2087 inpatients, 125 (6.0%) were excluded owing to lack of testing information, and 4 were excluded owing to admission within 30 days prior to the test result (eFigure in the Supplement). The eligible cohort included 1958 patients with a mean (SD) age of 51.4 (4.3) years; 1442 (73.6%) were male and 516 (26.4%) were female (Table 1). Of these 1958 patients, 969 (49.5%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection; 572 cases (59.0%) were identified by antibody testing. Among the 969 inpatients with confirmed infections, 38 (3.9%) were determined to have had a COVID-19–related death (Table 2).ResultsPatients prescribed second-generation antipsychotics were less likely to test positive for COVID-19 infection than those not prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.86), whereas patients prescribed mood stabilizers were more likely to test positive than patients who were not exposed to medications in this class (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03-1.47) (Table 1). First-generation antipsychotic use was associated with a nonsignificant increase in odds of infection (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.40; P = .08). No difference in the rate of infection was observed in association with benzodiazepine or antidepressant exposure.ResultsEach of the second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and paliperidone), mood stabilizers (valproic acid, lithium, and lamotrigine), and first-generation antipsychotics (haloperidol, fluphenazine, and chlorpromazine) with at least 5% exposure in the study population were retained for regression modeling of infection (Table 3). After adjustment for age and sex, decreased odds of infection were observed in association with use of chlorpromazine (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.86), clozapine (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98), paliperidone (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42-0.81), risperidone (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86), and olanzapine (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86). Conversely, valproic acid use was associated with increased odds of infection after adjusting for age and sex (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.65). After full adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, sex, race and ethnicity, facility size, and region), medical risk factors (including body mass index, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease), and exposure to other medications, use of paliperidone remained significantly associated with decreased infection (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.84), whereas use of valproic acid remained significantly associated with increased infection (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.76) (Figure). Results of a sensitivity analysis limited to RT-PCR testing, with a 30-day medication exposure period for all participants, can be found in eTable 3 in the Supplement.ResultsIn the secondary analysis of mortality of 969 inpatients with infection, antidepressant medications were retained for statistical modeling based on bivariate analysis of medication class (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.21-1.20; P = .10). Chlorpromazine, clozapine, paliperidone, risperidone, olanzapine, and valproic acid were retained based on their significant association with infection after adjusting for age and sex. Clozapine was the only medication associated with decreased odds of mortality in the unadjusted model (OR, 0.25, 95% 0.10-0.62); this association did not remain statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.16-1.03) or after additional adjustment for medical risk factors (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.17-1.12) (Table 4). There were no deaths among COVID-19–positive patients prescribed chlorpromazine (n = 53) or escitalopram (n = 48). A list of individual psychotropic medications prescribed to the full study cohort and by outcomes (infection and mortality) is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement.Strengths and Limitations ::: DiscussionThis study has several strengths. Restricting the sample to inpatients with chronic psychotic disorders minimized differences in risk associated with community exposures, underlying psychiatric diagnosis, medication adherence, and access to care, thus facilitating assessment of the association between psychotropic medications and outcomes. Implementation of universal screening and use of antibody testing to detect prior infection helped identify patients who may not have received confirmatory testing by RT-PCR when infected owing to lack of test availability or other factors.Strengths and Limitations ::: DiscussionThis study also has several limitations. During the study period, the pandemic was at its first peak in New York. Interventions, including regular testing of staff and a statewide vaccination campaign, which successfully limited the spread of COVID-19 during the second surge of the virus,36 had not yet been implemented. The availability of tests and criteria for testing evolved during the study period and varied across facilities. Duration of medication use, medication dose, and polypharmacy may have been associated with differences in outcomes and were not explored in this analysis. In addition, medication exposure after infection could not be evaluated for patients who were transferred to outside facilities for medical treatment. Medication adherence, although likely high, was not directly assessed. Additionally, the study population represents a subset of adults with serious mental illness: those with persistent and severe illness, chronically exposed to psychotropic medications, who reside in long-term state psychiatric hospitals. The association between the use of psychotropic medications and the risk of COVID-19 infection may differ between patients with less severe psychiatric disease and those without prior medication exposure.ConclusionsExposures to several psychotropic medications were associated with risk of COVID-19 infection among inpatients with serious mental illness; decreased risk was observed with the use of second-generation antipsychotics, with paliperidone use associated with the largest effect size. Valproic acid use was associated with an increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to replicate our findings, evaluate their generalizability, and explore underlying mechanisms."
"Rapid Antigen Test Performance with the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern—Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron","Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a wide variety of diagnostic assays have been developed. These assays primarily use quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) which detect viral RNA. Due to their high sensitivity and specificity, qRT-PCRs function as the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics [1]. However, qRT-PCR-based diagnostics require advanced laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel. Furthermore, the relatively long time to receive results could hamper direct decision making.1. Another diagnostic assay is the rapid antigen-detecting test (RDT). RDTs can be performed at home, produce results within hours [2,3,4,5], and complement qRT-PCR-based diagnostics [6]. As the name suggests, RDTs are based on the detection of antigen presence.1. IntroductionThe emergence of new variants of concern (VOCs) highlights the need to continuously validate current diagnostic assays. Here, we assess the sensitivity of the OraSure InteliSwab™ using all currently identified VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron [7]) compared to the ancestral lineage (lineage A) of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we employ the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model to determine the InteliSwab™ performance in a controlled infection environment.2.1. Recombinant Nucleocapsid Protein Assay ::: 2. Materials and MethodsSARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) of described variants were expressed with an N-terminus poly-histidine tag in BL21(DE3) cells. Affinity capture of the protein was performed using nickel sepharose HP, followed by a buffer exchange into Tris/NaCl using a GE HiTrap 26/10 desalting column. The lineage A variant was expressed using reference sequence QHD43423.2, amino acids 1–419. Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations were cloned via mutagenesis and sequenced confirmed. All recombinant NPs used for device testing were of >95% purity. Expression levels of purified NP were 80–150 mg/L depending on the variant. To load the sample on the test device, 50 µL of sample was introduced at the center of the flat pad. With the developer solution vials resting in the test stand’s slots, the loaded test devices were placed in separate vials containing the developer solution. Each test device was left in the developer solution for 30 min, after which the result was read. A positive result was a red line at the test and control zones.2.2. Cells and Viruses ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in this study are summarized in Table S1. Virus propagation was performed in VeroE6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin (DMEM2). VeroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. At regular intervals, mycoplasma testing was performed. No mycoplasma and no contaminants were detected. Sequencing from viral stocks included libraries prepared from Stranded Total RNA Prep Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus kit per the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq at 2 × 150 base pair reads. No nucleotide change was found >5%.2.3. InteliSwab™ Assay on SARS-CoV-2 Isolates ::: 2. Materials and MethodsPrior to dilutions and tests, each SARS-CoV-2 stock variant was inactivated using irradiation with 2 Mrad. To evaluate the effect of the irradiation process on the InteliSwab™ results, the test was performed on irradiated and unirradiated 10-fold serially diluted Delta variant stocks. The results showed that the sensitivity of OraSure InteliSwab™ COVID-19 Rapid Test was the same for both the irradiated and the unirradiated stocks (Figure S1).2.3. InteliSwab™ Assay on SARS-CoV-2 Isolates ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThen, 10-fold serial dilutions of irradiated SARS-CoV-2 variants were performed with 1× Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Three OraSure InteliSwab™ COVID-19 Rapid Tests were used to test each dilution, making a total of 15 test devices per variant. The test procedure was carried out as above. More precise limits of detection (LODs) for the test were determined by performing 2-fold serial dilutions in 3 replicates for each variant beginning at the 10-fold dilution LOD. Three test devices were used for each dilution. The same procedures for loading samples and analyzing test results were followed for the 10-fold serial dilutions. The final LOD for each variant was determined to be the minimum concentration (dilution) for which all 9 test devices were positive.2.4. Ethics Statement ::: 2. Materials and MethodsAnimal experiments were conducted in an AAALAC International-accredited facility and approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Institutional Care and Use Committee following the guidelines put forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 8th edition, the Animal Welfare Act, United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.2.4. Ethics Statement ::: 2. Materials and MethodsThe Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with SARS-CoV-2 strains under BSL3 conditions. Virus inactivation of all samples was performed according to IBC-approved standard operating procedures for the removal of specimens from high containment areas.2.5. Animal Experiment ::: 2. Materials and MethodsFour six-week-old Syrian golden hamsters (N = 6 per group, Envigo Indianapolis) were challenged intranasally with 40 µL of 1 × 103 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50)/mL virus in sterile DMEM. All virus stocks were full genome sequenced, and no SNPs >10% in spike or nucleoprotein were detected. Weights were recorded daily. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected in 1 mL of DMEM2 on day post infection (DPI) 1–7. A volume of 50 µL of medium was pipetted onto the absorbent pad of the InteliSwab™ as outlined in the instructions for use, described previously.2.6. RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR ::: 2. Materials and MethodsRNA was extracted from 140 µL of sample for each dilution with the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an elution volume of 60 µL. Following the extraction, copies of genomic RNA were determined by qRT-PCR with the TaqMan™ Fast Virus One-Step Master Mix and QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System from Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The qRT-PCR applied targets the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 [8]. Ten-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 standards with known copy numbers were used to construct a standard curve and calculate copies/mL.3. ResultsThrough the use of monoclonal antibodies, the OraSure InteliSwab™ COVID-19 Rapid Test detects the conserved SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). To assess the performance of the InteliSwab™ for different VOCs, we first generated recombinant NP for the identified SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and the ancestral lineage A (Table 1). Sample dilutions were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 50 µL of the dilution was used on each RDT. In order to determine the limit of detection (LOD), the assay was performed for each of the variant NPs with N = 20 tests. Limited variation was observed between the different NPs; the NP LOD was either 0.313 ng/mL for Alpha and Gamma or 0.469 ng/mL for lineage A, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (Table 2).3. ResultsThe sensitivity of the RDT was also evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates. Virus stocks were serially diluted 10-fold, starting at 1 × 105 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL, and SARS-CoV-2 genome copy number and cycle-threshold value (Ct value) were determined. Next, 50 µL of each dilution was tested in triplicate. The lowest virus concentration at which all 3 RDTs were positive was 1 × 103 TCID50/mL for all variants except Gamma, which was 1 × 104 TCID50/mL. These lowest virus dilutions with 3 positive RDTs represented Ct values between 21 and 23 and corresponded to genome copy numbers between 7.72 × 106 and 1.59 × 106 copies/mL.3. ResultsTo differentiate further, 2-fold dilutions were performed in triplicate, beginning at the lowest virus concentration with 3 positive RDTs from the 10-fold dilutions described above. Each of these dilutions was then evaluated in triplicate using 50 µL on the RDT. The LOD was defined as the lowest virus concentration with all 9 positive RDTs. The LODs based on TCID50/mL were 2.50 × 102 for both lineage A and Alpha, 5.00 × 102 for Beta, Delta, and Omicron, and 2.50 × 103 for Gamma (Table 2, Figure 1b). For Ct values, the LODs were 24.85 for lineage A, 25.16 for Alpha, 25.41 for Beta, 25.03 for Gamma, 24.36 for Delta, and 25.04 for Omicron (Figure 1c and Figure S2). These values corresponded to genome copies/mL of 5.61 × 105, 6.06 × 105, 3.77 × 105, 4.30 × 105, 9.13 × 105, and 4.51 × 105, respectively.3. ResultsTo determine the performance of the RDT in a controlled infection environment, we used the SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster model. Six 4–6-week-old male and female Syrian golden hamsters were intranasally inoculated with 1 × 103 TCID50/mL for each variant. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected daily in 1 mL DMEM containing 2% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Swabs were analyzed by qRT-PCR and tested on the InteliSwab™ (1 RDT per hamster per day, 50 µL). On average, all 6 animals were positive for 4 consecutive days, starting at 1 day post infection (DPI), for lineage A, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. For Omicron, however, the RDTs were positive 6/6 on 2 DPI, 5/6 on 3 DPI, and 3/6 on 3 and 4 DPI. At 6 and 7 DPI, the tests were all negative (Figure 2a). This was explained by decreased shedding after Omicron infection as compared to the other variants, and not by decreased test sensitivity (Figure 2b). The overall Ct values of positive RDTs were comparable between the different viruses and were at most 24–26 (Figure 2c). Combined with the reduction in shedding in this animal model, this suggests that the functioning of the RDT is directly related to the infection kinetics within the host.4. DiscussionAs SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve in the human population, there is a concern that diagnostic assays originally designed using the ancestral lineage A strain will not be able to detect new variants. Previous studies have demonstrated no variation in sensitivity for some of the RDT tests between the variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and the ancestral strain [9,10,11,12]. However, only a few studies have included Omicron [13]. Because such a pan-variant of concern antigen test is crucial for public health, there is a need to evaluate RDTs on the current VOCs.4. DiscussionUsing recombinant protein and cell-cultured SARS-CoV-2 variants, we observed only minor differences in the sensitivity of the InteliSwab™ for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron compared to the initial lineage A variant. Thus, we conclude that the mutations present in the NPs for the current VOCs do not affect the detection ability of this RDT. In addition, based on Ct values, no difference in sensitivity was observed when using the InteliSwab™ on Syrian golden hamsters experimentally infected with the different VOCs.4. DiscussionWhen compared to other manufactured RDTs, the InteliSwab™ demonstrated similar sensitivity for lineage A and the VOCs. For example, the commonly used Abbott BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test was initially reported to have a LOD between 8 × 105–2 × 106 genome copies/mL, while the Quidel QuickVue® At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test was determined to have a LOD of 2 × 104 TCID50/mL for lineage A [14,15]. Additionally, when evaluating the sensitivity of 4 other rapid tests, a study found all tests to have a general LOD between 2 × 106–5 × 106 genome copies/mL for lineage A, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta [9]. Ten rapid tests were also previously shown to be capable of detecting the Omicron variant at 2 × 106 copies/mL [13].4. Based on our results, recombinant NP can act as a valuable analytical tool for rapid screening the function of RDTs. Differences in post-translational modification in E. coli expressed NP appear not to impact monoclonal antibodies cross recognition of the de facto proteins clinically. This suggests that recombinant NP could be used as a surrogate to live viral testing and would enable easy routine monitoring of emerging VOCs.4. DiscussionIt is worth noting that peak shedding of lineage A, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, as determined by the lowest Ct value, was observed at 1 DPI, while peak shedding of Omicron was observed at 2 DPI. In addition, shedding with Omicron in the hamster model trailed off faster as compared to the other VOCs. Therefore, the delay in the detection ability of this RDT in the samples obtained from Syrian golden hamsters inoculated with Omicron suggests that the overall temporal dynamics in viral shedding might have an impact on the RDT’s ability to detect infection. Preliminary human data suggest a shift towards a delay in the peak of viral shedding in humans with Omicron, similar to what is shown here in the hamster model [16,17]. This shedding delay could result in an inability for the RDTs to detect a SARS-CoV-2 infection in its early stages.4. DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 has previously shown to have Ct values ranging between 18.77–40 in human oropharyngeal/nasal swabs [18]. While our study is limited by not evaluating the LOD of the InteliSwab™ for human samples, our results support the current rapid antigen testing guidelines made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: a negative result should not be used as a confirmatory result [19].4. DiscussionTo conclude, the OraSure InteliSwab™ Test showed comparable sensitivity between the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and all the VOCs including Omicron. Our data would suggest that the InteliSwab™ Test is not affected by the current mutations in the NP; however, it is not clear if future mutations may affect the RDT’s sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need to continuously evaluate existing diagnostic tests. With the potential changes in the temporal dynamics of viral shedding in humans, this should also include the real-world performance of RDTs."
COVID-19: Prevention and control measures in community,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, now designated SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, which may result in death [1]. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread.1. IntroductionThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Other routes have also been implicated in the transmission of coronaviruses, such as contact with contaminated fomites and inhalation of aerosols, produced during aerosol generating procedures. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been described. However, the extent to which this occurs remains unknown [2].1. IntroductionUnfortunately, there is no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic. Although there are cures for illnesses and developments made by leaps and bounds in our day, the strongest and most effective weapon that society has against this virus that is effecting not just health but also economics, politics, and social order, is the prevention of its spread. The interim guidance published by the WHO on 7 March 2020, “Responding to community spread of COVID-19,” states that preventing COVID-19 from spreading is through the development of coordination mechanisms not just in health but in areas such as transportation, travel, commerce, finance, security and other sectors which encompasses the entirety of society [3]. 1. IntroductionPreventive measures are the current strategy to limit the spread of cases. Early screening, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment are necessary to prevent further spread. Preventive strategies are focused on the isolation of patients and careful infection control, including appropriate measures to be adopted during the diagnosis and the provision of clinical care to an infected patient. Important COVID-19 prevention and control measures in community are summarized in Table.1. IntroductionThe most important strategy for the population to undertake is to frequently wash their hands and use portable hand sanitizer and avoid contact with their face and mouth after interacting with a possibly contaminated environment. To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (i.e., cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. There are posters and brochures prepared by many organizations on all issues related to protection from COVID-19 and are widely used all over the world (Figure 1).The WHO and other similar health organizations have published visual tools such as videos and posters to demonstrate the correct application of hand hygiene throughout the entire society (Figure 2).These posters, distributed throughout different parts of society in order to draw maximum attention to the importance of hand hygiene, created awareness among all of them. With the increase in the number of people carrying hand sanitizer with them for the application of instant hand hygiene and the spread of mask usage among people in countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, the pandemic was brought under control much more quickly. In those countries where such measures were not made mandatory, the exponential rise in the number of cases continues. 1. IntroductionSocial distancing is advised, particularly in locations that have community transmission. Many countries have installed quarantine and social/physical distancing as measures to prevent the further spread of the virus.1. IntroductionThese measures can include:1. Introduction· The full or partial closure of educational institutions and workplaces,1. Introduction· Limiting the number of visitors and limiting the contact between the residents of confined settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons,1. Introduction· Cancellation, prohibition and restriction of mass gatherings and smaller meetings,1. Introduction· Mandatory quarantine of buildings or residential areas,1. Introduction· Internal or external border closures, and1. Introduction· Stay-at-home restrictions for entire regions or countries.1. IntroductionPersonal protective equipment1. IntroductionFor people without respiratory symptoms, the WHO does not recommend wearing a medical mask in the community, since it does not decrease the importance of other general measures to prevent infection. The single use of a mask does not obstruct the disease; the improper use of the mask actually increases the risk of COVID-19 infection. In the WHO’s “Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19” interim guidance, the prioritized use of medical masks by health personnel was emphasized [4]. 1. IntroductionTo reduce COVID-19 transmission from potentially asymptomatic or presymptomatic people, the ECDC recommends the use of face masks [5]. The use of face masks in the community may primarily serve as a means of source control. This measure can be particularly relevant in epidemic situations when the number of asymptomatic but infectious persons in the community can be assumed to be high. Wearing a face mask could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, such as grocery stores, shopping centres, etc.; when using public transport; and for certain workplaces and professions that involve physical proximity to many other people (such as members of the police force, cashiers – if not behind a glass partition, etc.) and when teleworking is not possible.1. IntroductionIn the United States, the CDC updated its recommendations in early April to advise individuals to wear a cloth face covering (i.e., homemade masks or bandanas) when in public settings where social distancing is difficult to achieve, especially in areas with substantial community transmission [6]. Individuals should be counseled to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing the covering, practice hand hygiene after handling it, and launder it routinely. 1. IntroductionThe rationale for the face covering is primarily to contain secretions of and prevent transmission from individuals who have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection. The CDC also reiterates that the face covering recommendation does not include medical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers.1. IntroductionIndividuals who are caring for patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 at home should also wear a face cover when in the same room as that patient (if the patient cannot wear a face cover).1. IntroductionSocial distancing1. IntroductionSocial distancing is designed to reduce interactions between people in a broader community, in which individuals may be infectious but have not yet been identified hence not yet isolated [7]. As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing of persons will reduce transmission. Social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission. Examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets, and cancellation of gatherings. In public markets where it is difficult to maintain social distance, limitation of the entered person and encouraging online shopping can reduce the amount of contact.1. IntroductionWorkplaces are also one of the high-risk areas for COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, home office working must be encouraged if possible. In workplaces where home office working is not possible, adherence to recommendations of WHO remains quite important [8].1. IntroductionStudies have been conducted that support the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in the presymptomatic stage; social distancing is thus of critical importance in establishing control over the pandemic[2].1. IntroductionQuarantine 1. IntroductionQuarantine is one of the oldest and most effective tools of controlling communicable disease outbreaks. This public health practice was used widely in fourteenth century Italy, when ships arriving at the Venice port from plague-infected ports had to anchor and wait for 40 days (in Italian: quaranta for 40) before disembarking their surviving passengers. The quarantine of persons is the restriction of activities of or the separation of persons who are not ill but who may been exposed to an infectious agent or disease, with the objective of monitoring their symptoms and ensuring the early detection of cases. Quarantine is different from isolation, which is the separation of ill or infected persons from others to prevent the spread of infection or contamination. 1. IntroductionLooking at the available studies in the literature, quarantine is the most effective method in reducing both the number of infected and dead [9,10]. It has been much more effective in countries which initiated strict quarantine rules right from the beginning. In an article quickly published by the Cochrane Library evaluating 29 studies, results indicate that quarantine can reduce the number of infected at rates from 81% to 44%, and in the number of dead from 61% to 31% [11]. 1. IntroductionIn a mathematical model done on the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, it was shown that without strict quarantine rules the pandemic could not be controlled and that the number of secondary cases increased in proportion to the size of households. According to the simulation, if the household is comprised of 2 people and full quarantine has been put in place, expected secondary cases are 3 within the 14-day period; with a household of 6, this number increases to 16 [12]. 1. IntroductionDespite more than 2 months passing after the discovery of the first case in the US, the calls to stay at home put out in 33 states and by many local governments were insufficient. On the other hand, while it was greatly criticized, the quarantine and severe rules applied by China’s central government to people from Wuhan meant that they were able to effectively control the number of cases in states outside of Hubei and that death rates were reduced. 1. IntroductionIn the influenza pandemic in 1918, the importance of quarantine measures was demonstrated very clearly [13]. The most striking example of this comes from the US–the first case in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was observed on September 17, but social restrictions to prevent spread such as reducing crowds in public spaces were instituted on October 3, when there were 40 deaths per every 100,000 people. Unfortunately, the measures instituted after this point were insufficient and by the middle of October, this number reached 250/100,000 people. In contrast, the first case in St. Louis, Missouri, was observed on October 5, social restrictions were instituted on October 7, and both the number of cases and the rate of mortality was kept at low numbers. 1. IntroductionThe WHO recommends that contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 be quarantined for 14 days from the last time they were exposed to the patient [14]. For the purpose of implementing quarantine, a contact is a person who is involved in any of the following from 2 days before and up to 14 days after the onset of symptoms in the patient: 1. Introduction· Having face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 patient within 1 meter and for >15 min,1. Introduction· Providing direct care for patients with COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment,1. Introduction· Staying in the same close environment as a COVID-19 patient (including sharing a workplace, classroom or household or being at the same gathering) for any amount of time,1. Introduction· Travelling in close proximity with (that is, within 1 m separation from) a COVID-19 patient in any kind of conveyance.1. IntroductionActive monitoring of people who are quarantined is one of the important points for controlling the epidemic in the society. There are several mandatory mobile phone applications that control the compliance of people to quarantine in countries such as China, Japan and Korea. In Turkey, with the support of mobile phone operators, all persons who are quarantined are alerted instantly when they move away from their location. Certainly, deterrent fines will also increase compliance with quarantine.1. IntroductionCleaning and disinfection 1. IntroductionHigh-touch areas such as bedside tables and door handles should be disinfected daily with regular household disinfectant containing a diluted bleach solution (that is, 1-part bleach to 99 parts water). For surfaces that cannot be cleaned with bleach, 70% ethanol can be used. Toilets and bathrooms should be cleaned and disinfected with a diluted bleach solution (one part bleach to 9 parts water to make a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution). Disposable gloves should be used when cleaning or handling surfaces, clothing, or linen soiled with body fluids. All used disposable contaminated items should be placed in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clothes, bed linens, and bath and hand towels should cleaned using regular laundry soap and water or machine washed at 60–90°C with common laundry detergent. Disposable gloves should be used when cleaning or handling surfaces, clothing, or linen soiled with body fluids. All used disposable contaminated items should be placed in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste.1. IntroductionIncreasing testing capacity1. IntroductionAnother important point in preventing the spread of the disease throughout society is to increase the number of tests and thus pinpoint more cases, isolate them, and trace those who have been in contact. For this reason, increasing laboratories’ test capacity and developing new testing strategies are of utmost importance. Different methods such as rapid-testing kits, serologic methods and self-collected specimen tests are being used throughout the world to determine cases which in turn help adherence to isolation rules. 1. IntroductionIn South Korea, which acted quickly to administer free-of-charge and extensive public testing for COVID-19, “drive through testing” was initiated for the first time [15]. The ease of its application, reduction in the number of people who applied to health centres, and the capacity to investigate more people in lesser time appears as a successful strategy. Similar applications based on this model are being instituted in Germany and other countries after South Korea. 1. IntroductionPrevention and control measures in Turkey1. IntroductionSeveral different containment measures were implemented by the Turkish government. These included social distancing, travel restrictions on visitors arriving from high-risk counties, quarantine for nationals returning from high-risk locations, and closure of schools and certain types of workplaces. The government declared on March 12th that all schools including universities were to be closed starting from March 16th.1. IntroductionTurkey put into place several measures to limit movement of people. Citizens 65 years old or older, patients with immune system deficiency, chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease as well as users of drugs that disrupt the immune system were restricted from leaving their homes and using public transportation. 1. IntroductionMajor containment actions taken are summarized in Figure 3. All ministries published general instructions on COVID-19 prevention and control measures in their organizations [16]. As of April 13, approximately 40,000 tests have been reached per day with a total of 73 authorized laboratories, and the number of performed daily tests is gradually increasing.2. ConclusionIn COVID-19, which has no approved treatment, it is very important to prevent the spread in the society. The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.AcknowledgmentsRahmet GÜNER and Firdevs AKTAŞ are the members of the COVID-19 Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey.

Cryo-EM Structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Endoribonuclease Nsp15,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus at the center of the unprecedented Covid-19 global health pandemic. All coronaviruses have large single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that harbor two open reading frames that are translated upon entry into the host (Fig. 1). The two open reading frames in SARS-CoV-2 are translated by host ribosomes into two long polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases into distinct non-structural proteins (designated by the Nsp acronym). These non-structural proteins serve a variety of roles in virus replication, virus assembly, and evasion of host viral sensors, but the precise function of many of these proteins are poorly understood (1). Although some inhibitors show promise as antiviral drugs directed specifically against SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins, there is a pressing need to understand the structure and function of the non-structural proteins to aid in the development of new and effective antiviral therapies for Covid-19 (2).Introduction:Nsp15-like endoribonucleases are a characteristic of all coronavirus family members(3). Biochemical experiments with recombinant Nsp15 have established that it preferentially cleaves RNA substrates 3′ of uridines, and therefore Nsp15 is commonly called endoU alluding to its cleavage specificity (4–7). Conservation of Nsp15 across Coronaviridae suggests that its endonuclease function is critical for their viral life cycle, however the specific role of Nsp15 in viral propagation is still unclear. Nsp15 was initially thought to play an essential proofreading role in viral replication until it was shown that the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), can replicate with a catalytically-deficient variant of Nsp15 (3, 6). More recent work suggests that rather than functioning in viral replication, Nsp15 processes viral RNA to evade host sensors to foreign nucleic acids (8, 9). For instance, analysis of viral RNA from MHV-infected cells harboring a catalytically-deficient Nsp15 revealed an accumulation of 12–17 polyuridine tracts at the 5′-end of the negative-strand viral RNA intermediates. Considering that polyuridine negative-strand RNA elicits an interferon mediated response, this suggests a role for Nsp15 in regulating the length of polyuridines found at the 5′-end of negative-strand viral RNA to evade activation of the host innate immune response (Fig. 1)(8). High-throughput sequencing from MHV-infected macrophages also recently identified additional Nsp15 cleavage sites within the viral positive-strand RNA (Fig. 1)(10). Collectively, these studies suggest the existence of multiple Nsp15 cleavage targets that are important to regulate the accumulation of viral RNA and prevent activation of RNA-activated antiviral responses.Introduction:Crystal structures of Nsp15 have been reported for a number of Coronaviridae. These structures of Nsp15 have revealed a common hexameric assembly made up of a dimer of Nsp15 trimers (4, 5, 11–13). Each Nsp15 protomer is composed of three domains including an N-terminal domain (ND) that is important for oligomerization, a variable middle domain (MD), and a C-terminal endonuclease (endoU) domain that shares homology with other endoU enzymes (Fig. 2A)(14). Nsp15 is only active as a hexamer, but the molecular requirement for Nsp15 oligomerization is unknown. A crystal structure of Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-1 lacking the first 28 residues of the ND is monomeric and reveals a misfolded endoU active site suggesting that Nsp15 may rely on oligomerization as an allosteric activation switch (12). How Nsp15 specifically cleaves the phosphodiester bond following uridines is also poorly understood. The Nsp15 active site contains two well conserved histidine residues that are important for catalysis and reminiscent of the well characterized RNase A active site (4, 11, 13, 15). RNase A catalyzes a two-step reaction that first generates a 2′3′-cyclic phosphate (2′3′-cP) that is then hydrolyzed to form a 3′-phosphate (3′-P) (16). It is currently unclear if Nsp15 facilitates the second hydrolysis step like RNase A (17, 18). To gain insight into the structure and catalytic mechanism of Nsp15, we solved a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2. The cryo-EM derived atomic model identified Nsp15 residues important for uridine recognition and molecular dynamic simulations uncovered the conformational malleability of the endoU domain. Furthermore, biochemistry and mass spectrometry revealed molecular details into how the Nsp15 hexamer processes RNA.Cryo-EM reconstruction reveals the hexameric arrangement of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 ::: Results:We characterized SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 bound to a UTP nucleotide by single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recombinant wild-type (wt) Nsp15 was purified as a stable hexamer using a bacterial expression system (Fig. S1). Over 1000 micrographs were collected from grids prepared with recombinant wt-Nsp15 and an excess of UTP. Following 3D classification, the particles converged into a single prominent class with a resolution of 3.36 Å (Fig. S2). The cryo-EM reconstruction of wt-Nsp15 bound to UTP revealed a hexameric assembly containing 6 protomers of Nsp15 (designated as P1-P6) (Fig. 2B) with D3 symmetry. Classification and refinement were performed with and without imposing D3 symmetry, however no asymmetric conformational states were observed. A combination of rigid-body and real space refinement was used to fit the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 (PDB ID: 6wlc) into the cryo-EM reconstruction (Table 1).Cryo-EM reconstruction reveals the hexameric arrangement of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 ::: Results:For each Nsp15 molecule, all three domains of Nsp15 were clearly visible in the reconstruction as well as the uracil base and ribose sugar of the bound UTP molecule (Fig. S2). Despite adding excess manganese to the storage buffer, we did not observe discrete density for a metal ion suggesting that the stabilizing effect of manganese may be due to non-specific interactions along the highly charged patches of Nsp15 (4, 19). Overall the cryo-EM structure of Nsp15 is very similar to recently published crystal structures of SARS-Cov-2 Nsp15 (11). The barrel-shaped Nsp15 particle has dimensions of 100 × 110 Å with a narrow, negatively-charged channel that runs through the middle (Fig. 2B). The small ND domain, composed of 64 amino acid residues, mediates oligomerization of the complex by forming two head to head stacked trimers. Following the ND is the MD, composed of a mixture of beta-strands and two small alpha-helices (Fig. 2C). Following the MD is the well-conserved endoU domain containing the nuclease active site (Fig. 2C). The unique arrangement of the 6 individual Nsp15 protomers positions the endoU domains on opposite ends of the hexamer (Fig. S3).Cryo-EM reveals the basis for uridine specificity ::: Results:The Nsp15 active site contains several residues that are well conserved amongst Nsp15 homologues and important for nuclease activity and specificity (Fig. 3A and S4). The active site within each individual Nsp15 protomer lies near the interface with a neighboring endoU domain (Fig. 3B). This close positioning of the active site to the neighboring protomer hints at a possible mechanism of allosteric communication between the Nsp15 protomers. The active site residues within the endoU domain have well defined side-chain density in the cryo-EM reconstruction along with additional density for a ligand (Fig. 3B, S2 and Mov. S1). While we used an excess of UTP when vitrifying Nsp15, we modeled uridine 5′-monophosphate (5′-UMP) into the active site because there was no observable density to account for the β- and γ-phosphates (Fig. 3C, S2). We observed additional ambiguous density next to 5′-UMP, which was modeled as a phosphate ion (Fig. 3C; model 3′-PO4) (Fig. S2). The ribose sugar of uridine forms van der Waals interactions with Y343, suggesting that this residue is critical for orienting the ribose within the active site for cleavage (Fig. 3C; top). Mutation of the equivalent tyrosine to alanine in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) Nsp15 leads to an almost complete loss in nuclease activity, underscoring the importance of this tyrosine residue (4, 5).Cryo-EM reveals the basis for uridine specificity ::: Results:The cryo-EM structure revealed the significance of S294 for uridine specificity. Molecular docking of 5′-UMP into the Nsp15 active site previously suggested that this serine residue may be the critical determinant for base specificity (5). The O2 and N3 positions of the uracil base are within hydrogen bonding distance of the S294 backbone N and side-chain OG atoms, respectively (Fig. 3C; bottom). Nsp15 N278 is also within hydrogen bonding distance of Ser294 and likely contributes to proper positioning of Ser294 within the active site. Across Nsp15 homologues the equivalent residue to S294 is either a serine or threonine (Fig. 3A). Previous work with SARSCoV-1 Nsp15 demonstrated that mutation of this serine to a threonine does not affect activity. Yet, mutation to an alanine reduces cleavage activity by more than 5-fold and abrogates uridine specificity such that a single rU or rC containing deoxyribonucleotide are cleaved at comparable rates (5). While this manuscript was in preparation a series of additional Nsp15 crystal structures with different ligands were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (20). One of these structures includes a 5′-UMP in the active site. This crystal structure is in excellent agreement with our cryo-EM reconstruction and supports the same conclusions drawn about the role of S294 in base specificity. The crystal structure also reveals L346 is within hydrogen bonding distance with O4 of the uracil base and likely contributes to active site alignment along with uridine specificity. Interesting, L346 is not ordered in our cryo-EM reconstruction suggesting substrate binding may promote additional ordering of the active site. Thus, our cryo-EM reconstruction, recent crystal structures, and previous biochemical work support a prominent role for S294 in uracil base discrimination within the Nsp15 active site.Two active site histidine residues are required for nuclease activity ::: Results:The active site of Nsp15 contains three residues that are required for catalysis including two histidine residues and a lysine residue, which is analogous to the active site of RNase A. Within the RNase A active site, one histidine functions as a general base to activate the 2′OH while the other histidine functions as a general acid to donate a proton to the leaving 5′OH (16). During the second hydrolysis step the roles of the two active site histidine residues are reversed. The three Nsp15 catalytic residues, H235, H250, and K290 are clustered around the ribose sugar of 5′-UMP (Fig. 3C; top). H250 and K290 are both within hydrogen bonding distance of the 2′OH of the ribose. The active site arrangement suggests that similar to RNase A, H250 functions as a general base to activate the 2′OH for nucleophilic attack, while K290 stabilizes the deprotonation of O2′. In contrast, H235 is set back further from the ribose and is within hydrogen bonding distance of the phosphate ion that we modeled into the active site (Fig. 3C; top). This modeled phosphate is adjacent to the 3′OH of the ribose and mimics the position of the phosphate group to be attacked by the 2′OH. Based on the active site arrangement, H235 is properly aligned to play the role of the general acid during the transesterification reaction.Two active site histidine residues are required for nuclease activity ::: Results:To verify that our recombinant Nsp15 retained nuclease activity and to confirm the significance of the SARS-CoV-2 active site histidine residues, we adapted a FRET-based assay previously used to measure the activity of Nsp15 from MERS coronavirus (4). We used a short 6-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AAAUAA) that is cleaved by Nsp15 3′ to the single rU. The substrate contains 5′-fluorescein (FI) and 3′-TAMRA labels. The FI fluorescence is quenched by the TAMRA label in the uncleaved substrate, and we can monitor RNA cleavage by measuring the increase in FI fluorescence as the TAMRA label is released. We made two single mutants of Nsp15 in which we individually mutated the active site histidine residues to alanine (H235A or H250A). Both mutants purified as stable hexamers, confirming that these mutations do not disrupt the oligomerization of Nsp15 (Fig. S1). We measured RNA cleavage over a one-hour time course with wt-Nsp15 and the H235A and H250A Nsp15 variants. Wt-Nsp15 displayed robust RNA cleavage that increases as a function of time, but we could not detect any RNA cleavage with the two histidine mutants (Fig. 3D). These results confirm that recombinant Nsp15 is active and H235 and H250 are required for RNA cleavage.Nsp15 predominantly catalyzes 2′-O-transesterification ::: Results:After confirming that our recombinant Nsp15 was active, we used mass spectrometry to determine the identity of the Nsp15 RNA cleavage products. First, we calculated the theoretical masses of all potential cleavage products from our 6-mer FRET RNA substrate (Table S1). Mass spectrometry can identify the site of RNA cleavage. Moreover, mass spectrometry can distinguish the mass difference of 18.01 Da for the two possible 3′-end products (the 2′3′-cP intermediate versus the 3′-P hydrolyzed intermediate). We analyzed the 6-mer FRET RNA substrate using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) in the absence of Nsp15 and observed a MS spectra peak of 3294.74 Da, corresponding to the theoretical molecular mass of the uncleaved RNA substrate (Fig. S5A and Table S1). Next, we analyzed the RNA products following a 30-minute enzymatic reaction with Nsp15. Similar to other Nsp15 homologs, we observed products resulting from a single cleavage site 3′ to the uridine (5′-AAAUÂA), confirming Nsp15’s strict specificity for uridine. We observed a prominent peak in the extracted ion chromatogram with a calculated mass of ~1463 Da, which was absent in our negative control (Fig. 4A). The experimental mass of this RNA product corresponds well with the theoretical mass of 5′-HO-AA-TAMRA (Table S1). The MS spectrum of the 5′-HO-AA-TAMRA product has a mass of 1464.43 Da and in conjunction with MSMS data confirms its identity (Fig. 4B and S5B). Furthermore, we could not detect any other 5′ cleavage products, confirming Nsp15 exclusively cuts the RNA substrate 3′ of the uridine. A second prominent peak was also detected in the extracted ion chromatogram that was absent in our negative control and corresponds to a 3′ RNA product (Fig. 4C). The MS spectrum of the 3′ product revealed a doubly charged ion at m/z 914.14 and, hence, a molecular mass of 1830.30 Da corresponding to 5′-FI-AAAU-2′3′-cP and another doubly charged ion at m/z/ 923.14 and, hence, a molecular mass of 1848.31 Da corresponding to 5′-FI-AAAU-3′-P (Fig. 4D, S5C and Table S1). To determine which 3′ RNA product is more prominent, we normalized and compared the abundance of the 2′3′-cP and 3′-P products assuming similar ionization efficiencies of the 2′3′-cP and 3′-P products (Fig. 3E). We observed that the 2′3′-cP makes up 80% of the total 3′-product confirming the 2′3′-cP is the major cleavage product and suggesting the rate of hydrolysis is slow.Nsp15 predominantly catalyzes 2′-O-transesterification ::: Results:We compared the active sites of Nsp15 and RNase A to determine why Nsp15 does not promote the hydrolysis step as efficiently as RNase A. We superimposed the active sites of Nsp15 and RNase A using a crystal structure of RNase A solved in the presence of 3′-UMP (21). H250 and K290 of Nsp15 superimpose well with the equivalent H12 and K41 residues from RNase A (Fig. 4F). In contrast, H235 from Nsp15 and H119 from RNase A do not superimpose (Fig. 3F). H119 of RNase A is near the ribose group and is fixed into position by a network of hydrogen bonds and tightly coupled to a carboxyl (Asp121) to promote catalytic action. Conversely, H235 of Nsp15 is ~ 8 Å away from the ribose group and therefore it is not positioned to promote hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate. This difference in Nsp15 active site architecture likely slows the hydrolysis reaction leading to an accumulation of 2′3′-cP products. This is reminiscent of the active site of a related nuclease Angiogenin (22). The active site of Angiogenin is partially blocked by a glutamine residue that is not found in RNase A (23). The glutamine residue alters the active site geometry in such a way that cleavage is not as efficient as RNase A and it primarily produces 2′3′-cP products.UTP binding stabilizes endoU domain conformation ::: Results:In addition to determining the structure of Nsp15 in the presence of UTP, we also determined several cryo-EM reconstructions of Nsp15 in the absence of ligand at resolutions ranging from 2.9 to 3.3 Å (Fig S6–S8). First, we vitrified the H235A-Nsp15 mutant, which cannot cleave RNA, in the presence of a 21-nucleotide single-strand RNA (SS-RNA) substrate in an attempt to solve the structure of Nsp15 bound to RNA. We processed this data with and without imposing D3 symmetry, but did not observe any asymmetric states or the presence of RNA. Overall the cryo-EM reconstruction of apo H235A-Nsp15 are very similar to the uridine-bound reconstruction with one notable difference, an observed loss in the local resolution of the endoU domain (Fig. S6). One possibility for this loss in resolution is the presence of heterogeneity in the conformation of the endoU domain. We carried out 3D variability analysis to model the conformational landscape of the endoU domain present in our cryo-EM data (24). This analysis revealed multiple conformational states of the endoU domain with respect to the remaining Nsp15 hexamer (Fig. 5A and Mov. S2). The conformational variability of the endoU domain is restrained, but suggests that in the absence of a ligand the endoU domain wobbles towards the central channel with respect to the ND and MD domains and is not locked into a fixed position.UTP binding stabilizes endoU domain conformation ::: Results:In order to confirm that the observed wobbling of the endoU domain was not due to the H235A active site mutation or the presence of RNA when vitrifying the sample, we determined two additional cryo-EM structures of wt-Nsp15 and Nsp15 H235A vitrified in the absence of any ligand. Both of these reconstructions also display a loss in the local resolution of the endoU domain in comparison with UTP-bound Nsp15 (Figs. S7–S8). We repeated 3D variability analysis on these datasets and observed similar conformational landscapes of the endoU domain (Fig. 5A and Movies S3–S4). Collectively the three apo-Nsp15 cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that the endoU domain of Nsp15 is dynamic and samples multiple conformations in its ligand-free state.UTP binding stabilizes endoU domain conformation ::: Results:Finally, we used molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the observed wobbling of the endoU domain in the absence of ligand. We looked at the dynamics of the Nsp15 monomer and Nsp15 hexamer in the presence and absence of 5′-UMP. We established the stability of the Nsp15 monomer and hexamer by determining the root mean square deviations (RMSD) from molecular dynamics trajectories following the convergence of the RMSD values in the last 100 ns of the simulations (Fig. S9). There is a significant difference in the RMSDs of the monomer compared to the averaged values of individual monomers from the hexamer both in the absence (2.0 vs 1.3 Å) and presence (2.3 vs 1.4 Å) of 5′-UMP. Thus, the hexamer provides stability for the individual Nsp15 protomers and this stability likely contributes to the requirement of Nsp15 oligomerization for RNA cleavage activity.UTP binding stabilizes endoU domain conformation ::: Results:Next, we determined the impact of 5′-UMP binding on the dynamics of the monomer and hexamer. Binding of 5′-UMP does not result in large changes in the thermal fluctuations, but results in differences with the dynamic correlation (Fig. S9). Dynamic correlation reflects the association between the distances of the alpha-carbons across the entire protein backbone. In the absence of 5′-UMP we observe correlations within the residues of individual domains of Nsp15, but there is little correlation among the three distinct domains. This suggests the ND, MD, and endoU domains are largely moving independently of one another in the absence of a ligand. In contrast, we observe an increase in the correlated motions of both the residues within the endoU domains across the hexamer and among the ND, MD, and endoU domains in the presence of 5′-UMP (Fig. 5B and Table S2). This observation is in-line with 5′-UMP-induced ordering of the Nsp15 endoU domain and a previous report that the addition of mononucleotide and dinucleotide analogs significantly increase Nsp15 stability by differential scanning fluorometry (20). Thus, 5′-UMP binding locks the endoU domain into a fixed position that correlates its motion with the rest of the Nsp15 higher-order assembly.DiscussionHere we present a cryo-EM derived atomic model of the hexameric endonuclease Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2. In the presence of 5′-UMP, Nsp15 has an ordered active site that draws many parallels with the well-studied RNase A, which utilizes an elegant acid-base reaction mechanism to catalyze a two-step reaction of transesterification and hydrolysis. Mass spectrometry revealed that analogous to RNase A, Nsp15 can catalyze both reaction steps, however we observed a significant accumulation of the 2′3′-cP product from the transesterification reaction indicating that hydrolysis is slow. Based on the comparison of the active sites of Nsp15 and RNase A this difference can be attributed to an alternative location of H235 in the Nsp15 active site. While the nature of the 3′-end of the cleavage product can have important implications for downstream RNA processing and/or function (22), it seems unlikely that the identity of the 3′-end is critical for viral pathogenesis. Nsp15, with a presumptive role in regulating the length of poly(U) tails at the 5′-end of the negative-strand (Fig. 1), generates a shortened negative-strand with a 5′-hydroxyl and a range of short U-ended oligonucleotide products with a mixture of 2′3′-cP and 3′-P ends (8).DiscussionThe 5′-UMP bound cryo-EM structure is similar to existing Nsp15 crystal structures, however, the apo cryo-EM reconstructions revealed structural heterogeneity within the endoU nuclease domain. This heterogeneity demonstrates that the endoU domain wobbles with respect to the N-terminal half of Nsp15 in the absence of RNA ligand. Molecular dynamics confirmed that in the absence of ligand the endoU domain moves independent of the rest of the molecule. In contrast, in the presence of 5′-UMP the endoU domain is locked down and its movement is correlated with the N-terminal half of the protein. While more work is needed to establish the functional significance of the endoU wobble, there are several possibilities as to why this could be critical for Nsp15 function. Flexible active sites that become stiff upon engaging substrates have been shown to promote catalysis by reducing the substrate-binding energy (25). Another possibility is that the wobbling of the endoU domain is important for Nsp15 to accommodate different RNA substrates. Recent work suggests that in addition to cleaving the 5′-end of the negative-strand, Nsp15 can cleave multiple sites within the viral RNA to prevent activation of host anti-viral sensors (8, 10). Finally, wobbling of the endoU domain may provide Nsp15 with a mechanism of allosteric communication between the six individual protomers. While we only observed Nsp15 particles with six-fold symmetry, we hypothesize that binding of large RNA substrates will lead to the formation of asymmetric states that rely on coordination between the protomers to bind and process RNA. This is further supported by the free energy estimations from molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed that 5′-UMP initially binds all 6 active sites, but only remains stably associated with a single protomer (Table S2).DiscussionIn summary, our cryo-EM reconstructions, biochemistry, and molecular dynamics reveal critical insight into how SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 processes viral RNA. The series of structures presented in this manuscript can be used to aid in the development of effective inhibitors which are urgently needed as reported cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. Nucleotide analogues have shown great promise as viral inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, thus uridine derivatives that could bind the Nsp15 active site should continue to be explored as new therapeutic targets (20). Moreover, recent in silico-based approaches have identified potential Nsp15 inhibitors that await structural and biochemical validation (26, 27).Nsp15 construct design ::: Materials and MethodsThe nucleotide sequence for the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) recognition site was added upstream of full-length SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 that was codon optimized for E. coli expression. The TEVNsp15 construct was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET-14b in frame with the N-terminal 6x His tag and Thrombin cleavage site to create the 6X-His-Thrombin-TEV wt-Nsp15 construct. Nsp15 catalytic-deficient variants H235A and H250A were created using the wt-Nsp15 template. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz).Protein expression of Nsp15 variants ::: Materials and MethodsWt-Nsp15 was overproduced in E. coli CD41 (DE3) competent cells in Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Transformed cell cultures were grown to an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0 prior to their induction with 0.2 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. Harvested cells were stored at −80°C until needed. Catalytic-deficient Nsp15 variants (H235A or H250A) were overexpressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLacI competent cells in Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Transformed cell cultures were grown to an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0. Cell cultures were stored at 4°C for 1 hour prior to their induction with 0.2 mM IPTG and overnight incubation at 16°C. Harvested cells were stored at −80°C until needed.Protein purification ::: Materials and MethodsCells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM β-ME, 5 mM imidazole) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified at 26,915 × g for 50 minutes at 4˚C and then incubated with TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). His-Thrombin-TEV-Nsp15 variants were eluted with 250 mM imidazole and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) in SEC Buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM β-ME). To remove the N-terminal 6x His-tag from His-Thrombin-TEV-Nsp15, variants were incubated with thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature in Thrombin Cleavage Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM β-ME, 2 mM CaCl2) for 3 hours. Thrombin cleavage was quenched by the addition of 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteolytic cleavage reactions were incubated with TALON metal affinity resin and tagless protein was eluted in batch and resolved by gel filtration using a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with SEC Buffer.Preparation of Nsp15 cryo-EM specimens ::: Materials and MethodsPurified wt-Nsp15 and catalytic-deficient Nsp15 H235A were resolved over a Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column using SEC Buffer to isolate the hexamer. Prior to grid preparation Nsp15 variants were diluted into low-salt buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mMPreparation of Nsp15 cryo-EM specimens ::: Materials and MethodsMnCl2, 5 mM β-ME). Nsp15 variants (0.75 μM) were incubated in the presence of excess 8 μM 22-nucleotide uridine-rich single-stranded RNA (UUUAGGUUUUACCAACUGCGGC/36-TAMSp/) (H235A-APO, dataset i), in the absence of ligand (H235A-APO, dataset ii), in the presence of excess 333 μM 22-nucleotide single-stranded RNA (SS-RNA: 5′-ACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAA-TAMRA-3′) (wt-APO), and in the presence of excess 2 mM uridine 5′-triphosphate (wt-UTP bound) for 1 hour at 4°C. UltrAuFoil R1.2/1.3 300 mesh gold grids (Quantifoil) were rendered hydrophilic using the Tergeo plasma cleaner (Pie Scientific). Protein mixture (5 μL) were deposited onto the grids and blotted for 3 seconds using an Automatic Plunge Freezer (Leica).Data acquisition and image processing ::: Materials and MethodsImages of Nsp15 variants were collected on a Talos Arctica electron microscope (Thermo Fischer Scientific) operated at 200 keV and equipped with a K2 Summit direct detection camera (Gatan). Movies were recorded in counting mode at a nominal magnification of 45,000x or 36,000x corresponding to 0.932 Å/pixel and 1.187 Å/pixel respectively (see Table 1). Total exposure time was 8.4 seconds at a dose rate of 6.54 e−Å−2s−1 resulting in a total dose of ~54 e−A−2, distributed over 60 frames. Images were recorded across a defocus range of −1.0 to −2.5 μm.Data acquisition and image processing ::: Materials and MethodsBeam-induced motion and drift were corrected using MotionCor2 (28) and aligned dose-weighted images were used to calculate CTF parameters using CTFFIND4 (29). CryoSPARC v2 (30) was used in all subsequent image processing. Particles were selected by template-based particle picking, downsampled by a factor of 4, extracted with a box size of 64 and subjected to an initial round of 2D classification. Full resolution particle projections from “good” classes were re-extracted using a box size of 256. Ab initio reconstruction with 3 classes was used to generate initial models. Three independent 3D refinement cycles were performed while applying C1, C3, and D3 symmetry respectively. Visual examination of the refined maps did not revealed significant differences between asymmetric units. For this reason, refined maps with D3 symmetry were used for all subsequent model building and analysis. Local resolution was calculated using cryoSPARC’s own implementation. Particles from each refinement were then post-processed using per-particle motion correction and global CTF refinement before undergoing a subsequent iteration of non-uniform refinement. Local refinement of the asymmetric unit of the map was performed by masking the asymmetric unit. The mask was padded by 5 pixels with a soft mask extended by 3 pixels. Each dataset was D3 symmetry expanded and locally refined with the fulcrum point defined as the center of the mask. 3D variability analysis was performed using cryoSPARC’s own implementation (24). The full mask from 3D refinement of each respective dataset was used, along with a D3 symmetry expanded dataset. A 5 Å filter resolution and 20 Å high pass resolution were used to capture movements of each asymmetric unit. Maps were visualized using the simple 3D variability display job with a total of 20 frames. Superposition of the model versus high resolution crystal structures revealed an error in the voxel size. Therefore the map was rescaled by 0.9647, to optimize the RMSD fit of the N-terminal domain to crystal structures PDB ID 6WLC and 6X4I.Model building ::: Materials and MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 crystal structure bound to 5′-UMP (PDB ID: 6wlc) was fit into the UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction using rigid-body docking in Phenix (31). The nucleotide density for the uracil base, ribose sugar, and α-phosphate was visible, however the density for the β- and γ-phosphates of the UTP molecules was ambiguous. For this reason, we modeled 5′-UMP. Additional density was also observed adjacent to the nucleotide within the active site. We modeled phosphate into this density, however the identity remains unknown. Fit was improved using a combination of rigid body and real-space refinement in Phenix (31) combined with iterative rounds of building in COOT (32). Hydrogen bond restraints were included for the UMP ligand to stabilize refinement in the poorly resolved ligand density. Molprobity (33) was used to evaluate the model and the model statistics are listed in Table 1. Figures and videos were prepared with PyMOL, Chimera, and ChimeraX (34–36). Model building for the apo-state cryo-EM reconstructions were not performed due to poor endoU domain density caused by conformational heterogeneity.Nsp15 endoribonuclease assay ::: Materials and MethodsReal-time Nsp15 RNA cleavage was monitored as previously described (4) with minor modifications. The 5′-fluorescein (FI) label fused to the FRET RNA substrate is quenched by its 3′-TAMRA label (5′-FI-AAAUAA-TAMRA-3′). The FRET RNA substrate (0.8 μM) was incubated with a constant amount of tagless Nsp15 variant (2.5 nM) in RNA Cleavage Buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM β-ME) at 25°C for 60 minutes. RNA cleavage was measured as an increase in fluorescein fluorescence. Fluorescence was measured every 2.5 minutes using a POLARstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech) set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 ± 12 nm and 520 nm, respectively. Three technical replicates were performed to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and two-tailed Student’s t tests.Mass spectrometry analysis of RNA cleavage products ::: Materials and MethodsTo analyze the masses of the RNA cleavage products produced by Nsp15, the FRET RNA substrate (0.8 μM) was incubated in the absence and presence of tagless Nsp15 variant (2.5 nM) in RNA Cleavage Buffer at 25°C for 30 minutes. Mass spectrometry was performed essentially as described in (37) with the following modifications. Buffer A was 400 mM hexafluoro-2-propanol, 3 mM triethylamine (pH 7.0) and buffer B was methanol. Additionally, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses were included in the MS analyses with included masses of m/z 914.14; 923.14; 1463.42.Molecular dynamics ::: Materials and MethodsInitial monomer structures were selected from the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 endoribonuclease bound to 5′-UMP (PDB ID: 6wlc). Four simulations systems were constructed, (a) a ligand-free monomer, (b) a 5′-UMP-bound monomer, (c) a ligand-free hexamer, and (d) a 5′-UMP-bound hexamer (with six 5′-UMP molecules). After introducing protons, each structure was solvated in a box of water; counter ions were added; and additional Na+ and Cl− ions were placed so that the salt concentration was 100 mM. The closest box boundary is at least 15 Å away from any protein atom. The charges for 5′-UMP were generated at the 6–31g*/B3LYP level with the FF14SB force field for amino acids. After proper equilibration of each system over 30 ns under various conditions, the CUDA implementation of the Pmemd module of Amber.18 (38) was used to simulate unconstrained dynamics for 500 ns for monomer systems at 2 fs time step and 300K under constant pressure. The hexamer trajectories were extended over 800 ns. The MMGBSA module of Amber.18 was implemented in free energy estimations."
COVID-19 Systemic Inflammatory Response,"COVID-19 systemic inflammatory reaction can be life-threatening due to its hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokine storm. The cytokine storm is not only one of the earliest and most debilitating symptoms in patients with COVID-19 but also contributes to the disease severity at the later stage (Siddiqi and Mehra, 2020). Once inside the cells, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by the pathogen recognition receptors, which trigger a downstream cascade of molecules leading to the activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the subsequent production of type 1 interferons and several other pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]-1β and IL-6) (Kawai and Akira, 2010; Conti et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Considerably, elevated plasma levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, IFN-γ–induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α), have been observed in some patients (Han et al., 2020; Karki et al., 2021). This expansion of an uncontrolled inflammatory response due to SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially leads to cell death by apoptosis, necrosis, or ferroptosis (a newly discovered type of programmed cell death), resulting in multi-organ damage in patients with COVID-19 (Banchini et al., 2021). Considering most of the acute and chronic deleterious effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are the consequences of hyper-inflammatory response of the virus, several inflammatory drugs have been used for the treatment of severe COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2020).Hyper-Ferritinemia in COVID-19: A Part of Hyper-Ferritinemic Syndrome SpectrumCOVID-19–associated systemic inflammation is thought to be the part of the hyper-ferritinemic syndromes. COVID-19 shares many clinical and laboratory features such as lymphopenia, reduced NK cell numbers and activity, abnormal liver functions, and coagulopathy, with the other hyper-ferritinemic syndromes such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) (Rosario et al., 2013; Shoenfeld, 2020). Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine and ferritin levels are the other hallmarks of hyper-ferritinemic syndromes common to COVID-19 (Colafrancesco et al., 2020).Hyper-Ferritinemia in COVID-19: A Part of Hyper-Ferritinemic Syndrome SpectrumFerritin levels are elevated in various inflammatory disorders and directly correlated with poor prognosis and severity of the COVID-19 patients (Mehta et al., 2020). Although the source of circulating serum ferritin in COVID-19 has not yet been determined, macrophages contribute considerably to release ferritin via a non-classical secretory pathway (Cohen et al., 2010). A recent in vitro study showed that hepatocytes could actively secrete ferritin (Ghosh et al., 2004). Besides its active secretion in hepatocytes, serum ferritin is also derived by hepatic cell death (Colafrancesco et al., 2020). Furthermore, a key iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin could increase intracellular ferritin levels by sequestering iron in enterocytes and macrophages (Daher et al., 2017). Activated innate immunity and cytokine cascades can accelerate the expression of hepcidin (Drakesmith and Prentice, 2012; Cassat and Skaar, 2013). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 can mimic hepcidin by inducing ferroportin blockage and can result in the elevated ferritin levels independent of the inflammatory response (Cavezzi et al., 2020). Overall, patients with COVID-19 experience hyper-ferritinemia through the above mechanism.Hyper-Ferritinemia Amplifies Inflammation and the Cytokine StormThe magnitude of the cytokine storm has a positive correlation with the serum ferritin levels. The high circulating ferritin levels in COVID-19 may not only reflect an acute phase response but also display other immunomodulatory functions (Recalcati et al., 2008; Edeas et al., 2020). Ferritin contains two subunits: L and H. H ferritin induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-beta and IL-6 and promotes the myeloid and lymphocyte proliferation by stimulating a specific ferritin receptor TIM-2 (Ruscitti et al., 2016). Also, there is compelling evidence that the cytokine storm in hepatic cells is directly correlated with the extracellular ferritin levels (Ruddell et al., 2009). Thus, the mutual promotion of ferritin and inflammatory cytokine levels generates a vicious loop that constantly heightens the inflammatory state.Iron Dyshomeostasis in COVID-19Ferritin is composed of 24 subunits, which can bind up to 4,500 atoms of iron. This makes ferritin one of the major iron storage proteins in the cells. It incorporates Fe2+via ferritin iron pores and further oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+ by an H subunit inside the ferritin cage, leading to inert deposits of Fe3+ that are unavailable for intracellular use or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Philpott, 2018). Ferritin can also release Fe3+ and reduce it to Fe2+(Kidane et al., 2006), indicating that iron is critical in COVID-19 pathogenesis (Bellmann-Weiler et al., 2020; Edeas et al., 2020). Notably, iron overload directly influences several critical manifestations of COVID-19 such as systemic inflammation, hyper-ferritinemia, and immune dysfunction.Iron Dyshomeostasis in COVID-19COVID-19–associated iron overload can be triggered by the release of the free iron from the damaged hemoglobin and ferritin catabolism. The process of viral infection is facilitated by several SARS-CoV-2 accessory viral proteins, including open reading frames (ORFs)-3, 10, and 8. The virus can interact with hemoglobin through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), CD-147, CD-26, and other receptors. The heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin is attacked by ORF-8 and surface glycoprotein binding to porphyrin. Consequently, hemolysis and dysfunctional hemoglobin are engendered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, with or without forming a complex with the released heme (Cavezzi et al., 2020). Damage to hemoglobin causes dissociation of the porphyrins from iron and releases iron into the circulation resulting in the condition of iron overload (Cavezzi et al., 2020).Iron Dyshomeostasis in COVID-19A retrospective cohort study showed that ferritin could lose a part of its inner iron content, giving rise to extremely high serum levels of free iron (Pretorius and Kell, 2014). Iron deposits derived from the ferritin lead to a poorly labile iron pool, indicating that the abundance of ferritin is a key factor governing iron homeostasis. Conversely, depletion of ferritin results in the release of iron into the labile iron pool, resulting in increased sensitivity to ferroptosis (Stockwell et al., 2020). Several studies have suggested that the selective autophagic turnover of ferritin (ferritinophagy) contributes to ferroptosis in fibroblasts and cancer cells (Hou et al., 2016). Although the role of ferritinophagy in COVID-19 remains unclear, its contribution in the pathological processes of neurodegeneration, cancer, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and urinary tract infections is well established (Tang et al., 2018).Iron Dyshomeostasis in COVID-19Iron metabolism is objectively related to clinical syndromes during COVID-19 by inducing a series of biological events (Cavezzi et al., 2020). By interacting with molecular oxygen, excess intracellular iron can generate ROS (through Haber–Weiss and Fenton reactions), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive sulfur species (RSS) (Oexle et al., 1999). Through redox damage, mitochondrial dysfunction is favored, resulting in ferroptosis, multiple tissue damage, and subsequent fibrosis (Le Lan et al., 2005). During severe inflammatory conditions, excess iron can deteriorate the inflammatory reaction by inducing a severe pro-coagulant state (Pretorius and Kell, 2014). Moreover, higher iron levels may facilitate virus multiplication in the host cells (Drakesmith and Prentice, 2008). Iron depletion or chelation has been considered as a potential antiviral therapy to protect against excessive inflammatory responses and tissue damage by sequestering iron and preventing oxygen radical formation and lipid peroxidation in patients with COVID-19 (Perricone et al., 2020). In addition, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its receptors for entry into host cells can be prevented by lactoferrin, an iron chelator (Rainey et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2020).Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-Mediated Ferritinophagy in COVID-19Recently, a ferroptosis signature has been observed in patients with COVID-19 (Jacobs et al., 2020). Ferroptosis inhibitors, such as ferrostatin-1, have been applied as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. Notably, NCOA4 has been reported to be the cargo receptor of ferritin in ferritinophagy (Dowdle et al., 2014; Mancias et al., 2014). NCOA4 binds to ferritin and delivers it to autophagosomes for ferritin degradation and iron release. ROS, RNS, RSS, and ferroptosis are generated by excess iron, consequently resulting in multiple tissue injury (Supplementary Figure S1). Additionally, Joseph et al. demonstrated that a direct association between a key surface arginine in ferritin and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for the delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes (Mancias et al., 2015). Notably, NCOA4 depletion inhibits the delivery of ferritin to the lysosome, resulting in the disruption of ferritin degradation. The degradation of NCOA4 by HERC2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leads to suppressed ferritinophagy and elevated levels of ferritin (Mancias et al., 2015).Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-Mediated Ferritinophagy in COVID-19Therefore, we hypothesize that cytokine storms caused by SARS-COV-2 infection may promote hyper-ferritinemia which can further intensify the inflammation. Elevated ferritin levels can trigger NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and may lead to ferroptosis, cell death, and organ damage. NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy can be targeted to limit the ferroptosis and, therefore, prevent the multi-organ damage and severity in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). Further studies should be conducted to confirm the involvement of NCOA4 and ferritinophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection: A multi-center study,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected most countries all over the world since its first case at the end of 2019. The genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 was initially reported by Lu and colleagues, suggesting this coronavirus had enveloped RNA, resembling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in both structural and homological ways [1]. To date, there are more than 10 million confirmed cases, with over 500 thousand reported deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 daily report dashboard (https://covid19.who.int/). As reported by the WHO, North America has been the most affected continent, followed by Europe. China has undergone this viral crisis and successfully blocked it’s spread to some extent. However, there still have already been more than 80 thousand confirmed cases and 4,600 deaths in China.IntroductionDuring this COVID-19 attack, besides the primary infection of SARS-CoV-2, many other complications are emerging, contributing greatly to the mortality. Among these, co-infection plays a crucial role, threatening many COVID-19 patients’ lives [2]. As were reported by researchers, the prevalence of co-infection was variable, being found to occur in half of the non-survivors [3]. The pathogens of respiratory co-infection could be many, either common or rare, including bacteria, virus, fungus, etc. And bacteria was reckoned one of the most commonly isolated one [4]. There is no doubt that the co-infection could be a significant promoter to the final mortality of COVID-19 patients. However, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many hospital and health care organizations are short of hands, and many potential diagnoses could not be made according to the “golden diagnostic criteria ''. The concept of “clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection” was therefore presented in this study in order to give more indications toward the timing of launching empiric anti-bacterial therapy, when patients are highly considered to have suspected bacterial co-infection.IntroductionTo decrease the mortality of COVID-19 patient as much as possible, the early recognition and managements of bacterial co-infection seem rather indispensable. In the present study, 905 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 7 different cities in both Hunan and Hubei province, China, were enrolled for investigation. The cases with suspected bacterial co-infection were clinically diagnosed according to some specific diagnostic criteria (see below). The clinical data of these clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection (CDBC) patients were collected for further retrospective analyses in order to throw light upon the characteristics of them, facilitating early recognition and managements.Study design and participants ::: MethodThe initial hospital admittance time of the enrolled patients range from January 10th to February 28th, 2020. Every participant of this study has either signed written or made oral consensus (the aims of the conducting study, the privacy protection policy, the duties and rights of enrolled patients were all told before oral consensus was made and the oral consensus was recorded by a voice recorder), as we were short of health personnel to make every participant sign a written consent during the viral outbreak. And this was permitted by the Ethics Committee of The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. COVID-19 diagnoses were made according to the diagnostic criterion from the 7th version of the guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China. All the clinical data were retrospectively recorded from the electronic medical record system in 7 different cities’ central general hospital respectively, including Yueyang, Shiyan, Shaoyang, Zhuzhou, Huaihua, Huanggang and Loudi. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and was performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration II.Data collection ::: MethodAll the 905 enrolled patients were from the separated COVID-19 units of these 7 hospitals. Computer tomography (CT) scan evaluations were made by at least 2 specialists from the radiology department. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR test quality control was performed by specialists from the clinical laboratory department. The collected clinical data include: the demographic descriptions, main symptoms, comorbidities, regular laboratory results (e.g. blood routine examination, renal function, liver function, myocardial enzyme), main treatments, etc. To be specific, all the laboratory and radiological results, from the beginning to the end, of those CDBC patients were collected when the bacterial co-infection diagnoses were clinically made (diagnostic criteria were described below). However, the test results of those non-CDBC patients were collected with the most abnormal ones during the whole hospitalization period. For privacy reasons, the raw data of these patients are not presented.Clinical definitions ::: MethodCOVID-19 diagnosis was made by SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-qPCR test with nasopharyngeal swabs before hospitalization of each participant. The RNA detection kits were provided by Sansure Biotech (Changsha, China) and being manipulated by specialized clinical laboratory technicians according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Clinical definitions ::: MethodThe clinical diagnosis criteria of bacterial co-infection are as follow (patients meet all of these criteria shall be considered CDBC): a, newly increased WBC counting (>9.5*10^9/L), with a majority of neutrophil; b, newly increased airway purulent secretion; c, increased serum procalcitonin; d, typical peripheral ground glass opacity mixed with increased density effusion opacities; e, effective empiric anti-bacterial therapy.Clinical definitions ::: MethodCOVID-19 patients who could be considered discharged when meeting all the discharging criteria from the 7th version of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China. Briefly, (1) normal body temperature for more than 3 days; (2) significantly recovered respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; (4) negative results of the nucleic acid tests of respiratory pathogens for consecutive two times (sampling interval at least 1 day).Clinical definitions ::: MethodMechanical ventilation indications: a, failed high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) therapy when 300>PaO2/FiO2≥150; b, PaO2/FiO2≤150 with failed short term NIPPV.Statistics analysis ::: MethodThe continuous variables were denoted as median (interquartile range, IQR) and comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The categorical variables were denoted as n (%) and compared by using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact Chi-square test. The association between potential risk factors and outcomes was estimated by using logistic regression. Kaplan–Meier methods were used for survival curve plotting and examined by log-rank test. The association between clinically diagnosed bacterial co-infection and all-cause mortality was examined by using multivariate Cox regression model. All analyses were performed using R software (The R Foundation, http://www.r-project.org, version 3.6.1). A two-sided significance level of 0.05 was used to evaluate statistical significance.Demographic features and clinical symptoms ::: ResultsAll the enrolled 905 confirmed COVID-19 patients were from 7 different centers (Yueyang, Shiyan, Shaoyang, Zhuzhou, Huaihua, Huanggang and Loudi). 86 out of 905 patients (9.5%) were CDBC according to our diagnostic criteria described above. Among the basic demographic features, CDBC patients tend to be older and the rest were found no differences (Table 1). Fever was more common among CDBC patients, especially the cases over 39°C, moreover, anhelation, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory rate were all increased among CDBC patients, while SPO2 was decreased (Table 1).CDBC occurred more frequent among COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities ::: ResultsWe analyzed several common chronic disease types among the enrolled patients. Hypertension and coronary heart disease are more prevalent among CDBC patients, along with diabetes. However, chronic lung diseases, liver diseases, kidney diseases and tumor were not different between CDBC and no-CDBC patients (Table 2).COVID-19 patients with CDBC tend to have increased neutrophils count and decreased lymphocytes ::: ResultsGenerally speaking, COVID-19 patients have normal WBC counting (20% of all the enrolled COVID-19 patients had increased WBC count). However, according to our findings, once WBC of COVID-19 patients increased notably, with a majority of neutrophils, they were highly suspected to have bacterial co-infection (43% of the CDBC had increased WBC count while non-CDBC only 3%). Moreover, lymphocytes count could even be further decreased (Table 3).Serum inflammatory indicators and coagulation, hepatic and renal function ::: ResultsProcalcitonin (PCT) of CDBC patients were found notably increased, supporting its widely accepted diagnostic role for bacterial infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reaction protein (CRP), common inflammatory indicators as they are, were both increased in CDBC patients. In blood clotting indexes, prothrombin time (PT) and D-dimer were found increased compared with non-CDBC patients, along with aspartate amino transferase (AST) and bilirubin in liver function tests. Moreover, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), Myohemoglobin and random blood sugar (RBS) were all increased in CDBC patients (Table 4).Radiological findings and treatments ::: ResultsEvery enrolled patient had at least 2 CT scan results during hospitalization. CDBC patients always have ground-glass opacities (GGO) mixed with high density effusion opacities (HDEO), and pleural effusion could even be found in some CDBC cases (Table 5). As for treatments, CDBC patients tend to be in need of more critical care facilities, including ventilation and other ICU medical care therapies. Also, the application of glucocorticoid was more common among CDBC patients. Moreover, retrospectively, we found the total mortality was notably increased among those CDBC patients (Table 5, Fig 1).Other potential predictors for CDBC diagnosis ::: ResultsTo evaluate the risk factors of CDBC, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. Decreased albumin account and glucocorticoid treatment could be the best predictors for CDBC, with the sensitivities 82% and 73% respectively. Moreover, advanced age, high WBC account, lymphopenia, PCT and CRP could all be CDBC predictors with reasonably high sensitivities. The cardiovascular comorbidities also could be considered predictors, however, the sensitivity is relatively low (Table 6).DiscussionUp to date, few studies have reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection, however, co-infection of influenza virus [5], fungus [6] and other atypical respiratory pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma) [7] have all been reported. According to our study, around 9.5% COVID-19 people were CDBC, which could give a huge rise to the whole mortality. A multi-center study was therefore conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of the CDBC cases among COVID-19 patients, finding them have more severe illness and increased inflammatory activities, along with an increased multi-system functional damage tendency.DiscussionViruses are one of the most common respiratory pathogens, and bacterial co-infection was not rare during primary respiratory viral infection, including influenza of many types (e.g. H1N1, H7N9, etc) [8–10], RSV [11], rhinovirus [12], and parainfluenza [13], etc) Specifically, a study regarding H1N1 in America showed 207 out of 683 enrolled patients acquired respiratory bacterial infection symptoms 72h after hospitalization, with 5.2 days as an average onset time. More than 60% of H1N1 patients had suspected bacterial co-infection, and around 30% patients could be diagnosed with bacterial co-infection [14]. Moreover, another study concerning critical influenza cases indicated that once bacterial co-infection occurred, the hospitalization duration and the final mortality would be both extremely increased [15]. Furthermore, bacterial coinfection could also be found during infection with other corona virus family members. During the 2003 SARS crisis, CDBC was a major promoter of high mortality, especially among those critical cases [16]. Moreover, bacterial co-infection in MERS was also notable, increasing the illness severity, and low albumin could be one of the most important risk factors [17, 18], which is similar with our findings. However, the coinfected bacterial pneumonia cases were up to 31%, not to mention the other types of bacterial co-infection. In this COVID-19 pandemic, Yang and colleagues have reported that hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was found in around 11.5% COVID-19 patients, which is in line with our results (9.5%), and bacterial co-infection is a major inducer of death as it could eventually lead to many organs and system failures, including sever bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and bacterial meningitis [19]. Also, many other studies reconfirmed the vital phenomenon that the antibiotic resistance could occur in COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [20–22].DiscussionAccording to our results, COVID-19 patients typically present with a normal white blood cell count, however, a suddenly increased WBC count during hospitalization shall alert the occurrence of bacterial co-infection. Lymphopenia, which could be resulted from a severe immune system disorder, is common in COVID-19 patients [5]. The cause of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients is widely considered cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by researchers [23]. According to the studies regarding SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, dendritic cells are always infected by the former, while T cells and monocytes the latter via dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [24, 25]. Similarly, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 would also affect dendritic cells, and therefore leading to the release of many cytokines and T cell apoptosis, eventually leading to immune system disfunction [24, 26]. This could be a key to the occurrence of CDBC as we found the lymphocyte count was further decreased in CDBC patients, indicating immune system disorders with a higher level. The increased inflammatory activity is a feature of COVID-19 [23], and the CDBC patients were found with further increased inflammation levels as CRP and ESR were notably ascendant [2], which was in line with the present study. PCT could be one of the most effective diagnostic indicators, which is also one of our CDBC diagnosis criteria, and studies showed a normal PCT level makes bacterial infection less likely and could guide discontinuation of anti-bacterial co-infection therapy, however, an increased PCT level is of great sensitivity but less specificity for bacterial infection diagnosis as it could also sometimes be increased in some other clinical symdromes (e.g. acute renal failure) [27]. However, we noticed an increased CRP and ESR rate among CDBC patients, and a study reported that the combination of increased PCT, CRP could provide a more useful method of distinguishing CDBC from an H1N1 influenza infection alone [28]. Segmental or lobar focal dense consolidation ± ground-glass opacities was reported the radiological feature of COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [2], and these results are also similar to our findings in CDBC patients’ CT scan. Increased PT, AST, CK-MB, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, TnI, LDH and myohemoglobin all together indicated a multi-system function damage and this might result from a secondary bacterimia following CDBC. Still, some researchers argued that the use of corticosteroid may have potential risks, as it could suppress our immune functions [29], which might therefore contribute to CDBC. We also found COVID-19 patients with CDBC tend to have an increased corticosteroid utility rate. Intriguingly, in the present study, we found older COVID-19 patients were more likely to have CDBC, while some other studies found CDBC was not age associated [30]. A potential reason could be that SARS-CoV-2 would induce more drastic immune reaction (e.g. CRS) than other respiratory viral infection [23], and immune function could be less active among older patients which might eventually give rise to the CDBC possibility. With the survival curve, we retrospectively noticed that, CDBC patients have increased possibility of death as the co-infection would aggravate the inflammatory burden of the body and toxic side effects of major organs (Kidney and liver, manly caused by antibiotics therapy).DiscussionSome limitation of the present study merit consideration. Initially, it is a real-world retrospective study, and the data collected were limited. A prospective analysis could be of more confidence and less bias. Secondly, the timing of CDBC onset was not distinguished, that is, CDBC could be community, hospital acquired or ventilation associated. And this might make the results less specific to HAP. Moreover, due to the lack of understanding of this highly contagious novel virus, the pathogens of CDBC have not been identified universally for safety reasons at the beginning of the global pandemic. But currently, microbial cultivation of respiratory secretions were recommended to make studies more informative and guiding the antibiotic therapy accordingly. Furthermore, a collection of dynamic laboratory and radiological findings could provide more confidence in the results.DiscussionTo summarize, 86 out of 905 (9.5%) confirmed COVID-19 patients were CDBC according to our diagnosis criteria (see methods part). CDBC patients tend to be more aged, and having more severe clinical manifestations with increased WBC account and worse lymphopenia. Inflammatory indicators are increased, along with increased biochemical laboratory results indicating multi-system function damage tendency. And GGO mixed with HDEO could be the feature of CDBC radiological results. Moreover, advanced age, high WBC account, lymphopenia, PCT, CRP, cardiovascular comorbidities, the utilities of glucocorticoid and ventilation are all risk factors of CDBC. To better identify and manage CDBC in early stage, more prospective studies regarding CDBC are extremely necessary."

The cardiovascular comorbidities also could be considered predictors, however, the sensitivity is relatively low (Table 6).DiscussionUp to date, few studies have reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection, however, co-infection of influenza virus [5], fungus [6] and other atypical respiratory pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma) [7] have all been reported. According to our study, around 9.5% COVID-19 people were CDBC, which could give a huge rise to the whole mortality. A multi-center study was therefore conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of the CDBC cases among COVID-19 patients, finding them have more severe illness and increased inflammatory activities, along with an increased multi-system functional damage tendency.DiscussionViruses are one of the most common respiratory pathogens, and bacterial co-infection was not rare during primary respiratory viral infection, including influenza of many types (e.g. H1N1, H7N9, etc) [8–10], RSV [11], rhinovirus [12], and parainfluenza [13], etc) Specifically, a study regarding H1N1 in America showed 207 out of 683 enrolled patients acquired respiratory bacterial infection symptoms 72h after hospitalization, with 5.2 days as an average onset time. More than 60% of H1N1 patients had suspected bacterial co-infection, and around 30% patients could be diagnosed with bacterial co-infection [14]. Moreover, another study concerning critical influenza cases indicated that once bacterial co-infection occurred, the hospitalization duration and the final mortality would be both extremely increased [15]. Furthermore, bacterial coinfection could also be found during infection with other corona virus family members. During the 2003 SARS crisis, CDBC was a major promoter of high mortality, especially among those critical cases [16]. Moreover, bacterial co-infection in MERS was also notable, increasing the illness severity, and low albumin could be one of the most important risk factors [17, 18], which is similar with our findings. However, the coinfected bacterial pneumonia cases were up to 31%, not to mention the other types of bacterial co-infection. In this COVID-19 pandemic, Yang and colleagues have reported that hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was found in around 11.5% COVID-19 patients, which is in line with our results (9.5%), and bacterial co-infection is a major inducer of death as it could eventually lead to many organs and system failures, including sever bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and bacterial meningitis [19]. Also, many other studies reconfirmed the vital phenomenon that the antibiotic resistance could occur in COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [20–22].DiscussionAccording to our results, COVID-19 patients typically present with a normal white blood cell count, however, a suddenly increased WBC count during hospitalization shall alert the occurrence of bacterial co-infection. Lymphopenia, which could be resulted from a severe immune system disorder, is common in COVID-19 patients [5]. The cause of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients is widely considered cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by researchers [23]. According to the studies regarding SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, dendritic cells are always infected by the former, while T cells and monocytes the latter via dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [24, 25]. Similarly, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 would also affect dendritic cells, and therefore leading to the release of many cytokines and T cell apoptosis, eventually leading to immune system disfunction [24, 26]. This could be a key to the occurrence of CDBC as we found the lymphocyte count was further decreased in CDBC patients, indicating immune system disorders with a higher level. The increased inflammatory activity is a feature of COVID-19 [23], and the CDBC patients were found with further increased inflammation levels as CRP and ESR were notably ascendant [2], which was in line with the present study. PCT could be one of the most effective diagnostic indicators, which is also one of our CDBC diagnosis criteria, and studies showed a normal PCT level makes bacterial infection less likely and could guide discontinuation of anti-bacterial co-infection therapy, however, an increased PCT level is of great sensitivity but less specificity for bacterial infection diagnosis as it could also sometimes be increased in some other clinical symdromes (e.g. acute renal failure) [27]. However, we noticed an increased CRP and ESR rate among CDBC patients, and a study reported that the combination of increased PCT, CRP could provide a more useful method of distinguishing CDBC from an H1N1 influenza infection alone [28]. Segmental or lobar focal dense consolidation ± ground-glass opacities was reported the radiological feature of COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [2], and these results are also similar to our findings in CDBC patients’ CT scan. Increased PT, AST, CK-MB, bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, TnI, LDH and myohemoglobin all together indicated a multi-system function damage and this might result from a secondary bacterimia following CDBC. Still, some researchers argued that the use of corticosteroid may have potential risks, as it could suppress our immune functions [29], which might therefore contribute to CDBC. We also found COVID-19 patients with CDBC tend to have an increased corticosteroid utility rate. Intriguingly, in the present study, we found older COVID-19 patients were more likely to have CDBC, while some other studies found CDBC was not age associated [30]. A potential reason could be that SARS-CoV-2 would induce more drastic immune reaction (e.g. CRS) than other respiratory viral infection [23], and immune function could be less active among older patients which might eventually give rise to the CDBC possibility. With the survival curve, we retrospectively noticed that, CDBC patients have increased possibility of death as the co-infection would aggravate the inflammatory burden of the body and toxic side effects of major organs (Kidney and liver, manly caused by antibiotics therapy).DiscussionSome limitation of the present study merit consideration. Initially, it is a real-world retrospective study, and the data collected were limited. A prospective analysis could be of more confidence and less bias. Secondly, the timing of CDBC onset was not distinguished, that is, CDBC could be community, hospital acquired or ventilation associated. And this might make the results less specific to HAP. Moreover, due to the lack of understanding of this highly contagious novel virus, the pathogens of CDBC have not been identified universally for safety reasons at the beginning of the global pandemic. But currently, microbial cultivation of respiratory secretions were recommended to make studies more informative and guiding the antibiotic therapy accordingly. Furthermore, a collection of dynamic laboratory and radiological findings could provide more confidence in the results.DiscussionTo summarize, 86 out of 905 (9.5%) confirmed COVID-19 patients were CDBC according to our diagnosis criteria (see methods part). CDBC patients tend to be more aged, and having more severe clinical manifestations with increased WBC account and worse lymphopenia. Inflammatory indicators are increased, along with increased biochemical laboratory results indicating multi-system function damage tendency. And GGO mixed with HDEO could be the feature of CDBC radiological results. Moreover, advanced age, high WBC account, lymphopenia, PCT, CRP, cardiovascular comorbidities, the utilities of glucocorticoid and ventilation are all risk factors of CDBC. To better identify and manage CDBC in early stage, more prospective studies regarding CDBC are extremely necessary."
E-Learning During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Surge in Childhood Obesity,"To study the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on body mass index, obesity, and overweight in children.Parents of children 3–15 years of age.Parents of children who were visiting a general practitioner or paediatrician.Children who visited hospital for well child check, acute pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, otitis media, and strep throat are included.Exclusion Criteria ::: Material and Methods Parents of children who were visiting SpecialistsChildren with chronic illness.ResultsSample size was 2000(n). 308 candidates did not respond. Respective data removed from database. Complete data available for n = 1692.ResultsDemographic data noted (Table 1). Table 1 presents the characteristics of the child participants. N = 1692, of which 1036 (61.2%) were males and 656 (38.7%) were females. Overall male: female was 1.5:1. Age-wise and gender-wise distribution across groups depicted in Fig. 1. Age range was between 3 and 15 years with mean age 8.5 years.ResultsFigure 2 is a pie chart that represents the distribution of child participants based on their BMI percentile. 78.4% of the study population is between the 5th and 85th percentile which, according to the CDC growth charts, comes under the healthy weight category. The study population with BMI percentile equal to or greater than the 95th percentile (which indicates that they are obese) constituted 5.4%. The “less than the 5th percentile” (underweight) category constitutes approximately 3%, and those who are between 85 and 95th percentile (At risk of being obese) also comprised approximately 13%.ResultsChanges in BMI, obesity and overweight before and after the COVID-19 lockdown period is shown in Table 2.ResultsPost-lockdown, the mean body mass index (BMI) increased among all participants from 17.32 to 17.80 kg/m2 (p < 0.001). The overall obesity (5.4–7.8%, p < 0.001) and overweight (13–17.8%, p < 0.001) burdens significantly increased after the lockdown period.ResultsThe eldest age group (13–15 years) had the greatest increase in obesity after the lockdown period (14–27%, p < 0.001), compared to those aged 3–7 (9.4%) and 8–12 (11.9%) years.DiscussionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing substantial morbidity and mortality, straining health care systems, shutting down economies, and closing school districts. While it is a priority to mitigate its immediate impact, we want to call attention to the pandemic’s longer-term effect on children’s health; COVID-19, via these school closures, may exacerbate the epidemic of childhood obesity and increase disparities in obesity risk.we found that, after the COVID-19 lockdown, the children's weight status has increased; the frequencies of their physical activities have reduced, and their sedentary, sleeping, and screen time have all increased.DiscussionWeight assessment of a child with obesity is accomplished by considering both the age of the child and the severity of the obesity. For infants up to the age of 2, BMI is not assessed. Instead, the infants' weight percentile is compared to length percentile. Body mass index charts are used for children between the ages of 2–20 years according to Centre for Disease Control (CDC). These CDC charts were developed in the year 2000 and are colour coded by BMI percentile: < 5th percentile (red), 5th − 85th percentile (green), 85th − 95th percentile (yellow), and > 95th percentile (red). The chart extends to a BMI of 35 kg/m2.DiscussionA study by conducted by Williams et al. (1992), on 3,320 children in the age-group of 5–18 years classified children as fat if their percentage of body fat was at least 25% for males and 30% for females, respectively [13]. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention defined overweight as at or above the 95th percentile of body mass index (BMI) for age and “at risk for overweight” as between 85 to 95th percentile of BMI for age [14, 15]. European researchers classified overweight as at or above 85th percentile and obesity as at or above 95th percentile of BMI [16]. An Indian research study has defined overweight (between ≥ 85th and < 95th percentile) and obesity (≥ 95th percentile) [17]. Another study has followed World Health Organization 2007 growth reference for defining overweight and obesity [18].DiscussionThe ecological model, as described by Davison et al., suggests that child risk factors for obesity include dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour [19]. The impact of such risk factors is moderated by factors such as age, gender. Family characteristics parenting style, parents’ lifestyles also play a role. Eating out or watching TV while eating is associated with a higher intake of fat. Parental feeding style is also significant.DiscussionAnother factor that has been studied as a possible contributing factor of childhood obesity is the consumption of snack foods. Snack foods include foods such as chips, baked goods, and candy. Many studies have been conducted to examine whether these foods have contributed to the increase in childhood obesity. While snacking has been shown to increase overall caloric intake, no studies have been able to find a link between snacking and overweight [20].DiscussionOne of the factors that is most significantly linked to obesity is a sedentary lifestyle. Each additional hour of television per day increased the prevalence of obesity by 2% [20]. Television viewing among young children and adolescents has increased dramatically in recent years [20, 21]. The increased amount of time spent in sedentary behaviours has decreased the amount of time spent in physical activity. Research which indicates the number of hours children spend watching TV correlates with their consumption of the most advertised goods, including sweetened cereals, sweets, sweetened beverages, and salty snacks [22].DiscussionIt was reported in one study in Copenhagen that online platforms were extensively used by the young generation to communicate with others, to play video games and to access social media prior to COVID-19 pandemic also [23]. But the pandemic increased screen time for children as schools shifted to E-learning. Although this was beneficial for educational purposes, the increase in screen time can further exacerbate sedentary habits as well as increase the risks for anxiety, depression and inattention [24].DiscussionA study had shown association between increased body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage as screen time increased [25]. Another study had shown association between screen time and increase in snacking and a consequent increase in weight [11].DiscussionStudies reported that children had higher tendencies to experience weight gain during the summer holidays. Such weight gain is difficult to shed and actually accumulates from one summer to another [26, 27]. Hence, if one considers the COVID-19 lockdown period as an ‘early onset summer holiday’, it could be anticipated that the childhood obesity rate will rise proportionately to the number of months the schools remain closed.DiscussionParents that shifted to telework had more time with their children. Needless to say, these faced new challenges in trying to balance taking care of their children, home-schooling them while at the same time tele-working. Nonetheless stronger family bonds are expected to have been developed as more family events under one roof had to be catered for [28].DiscussionIn our study, the mean body mass index (BMI) increased among all participants from 17.32 to 17.80 kg/m2 (p < 0.001). The overall obesity (5.4–7.8%, p < 0.001) and overweight (13–17.8%, p < 0.001) burdens significantly increased after the lockdown period. This is similar to study subjects of Jia et al. [29] where the youths showed a significant increase in BMI on average (21.8 to 22.1 kg/m2, p < 0.001), which was also observed in all education subgroups after lockdown. Similarly, increases in the prevalence of overweight (21.4% to 24.6%, p < 0.001) and obesity (10.5% to 12.6%, p < 0.001) were also observed in all education subgroups.DiscussionThis is similar to the Pellegrini et al. [30], where on average, during the lockdown period, self-reported weight and BMI significantly increased by 1.51 kg (p < 0.001 by t-test for paired samples) and 0.58 kg/m2 (p < 0.001), respectively.DiscussionSimilar results are seen in study reports of Kim et al. [31], where mean body mass index (BMI) increased among all participants from 26.7 to 27.7 kg/m2 (p < 0.001).DiscussionCOVID-19 restrictions, for the good of all, have reduced many healthy food and physical activity options for children. Clinicians, families and communities must create and prioritize alternate, safe options. The many effects of the COVID19 pandemic on childhood obesity must be considered in creating effective health policy going forward. However virtual platforms have been used by some schools to organise physical activity classes for children to easily follow at home [32]. Such initiatives should continue and be more readily implemented during these COVID-19 times.LimitationsThe first limitation of this study was the comparatively small sample size. Also, as food choices, culture, food availability, beliefs vary across different ethnicities this restricts the extrapolation of these findings to other ethnic and racial groups. The study should be conducted on a larger sample comprising more ethnically and socioeconomically diversified populations to better understand the influences of different ethnic and racial groups and socioeconomic status on child obesity. Because of the small sample size, the study may not have enough power to detect an association between a factor of interest and the child BMI percentile. LimitationsThe second limitation of this study was that the data were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. Parents might have tended to choose desirable answers. Self-reported body weight, may be subject to recall bias. Also, it is questionable whether parents were accurate reporters of their habits. Finally, this being a cross-sectional study, the direction of a relationship cannot be established between children’s BMI percentile and a parental or family factor even if the relationship is significant. To better understand the association of the parental and family factors with child’s BMI percentile, a longitudinal research design needs to be undertaken in future studies.ConclusionCOVID-19 places children at increased risk for physical and psychosocial sequelae. For schools that have the capacity to stream online classes, physical education teachers could stream exercise classes and few exercise programs could be adapted into at-home lesson plans to engage children in physical activity. A supportive relationship with adults can help “buffer” a stressful experience and support the child's adaptation. Ensuring the health of children, especially those with the chronic condition of childhood obesity, requires ongoing monitoring by healthcare specialists. Healthcare and educational systems should engage in an adequate supporting and managing system to deal with childhood obesity. Educating the parents on food availability, convenience and how to choose food wisely even if on a budget, is an issue that needs to be tackled. Advocacy for physical activity while maintaining social distancing is a must. BMI, obesity and overweight increased among children during the COVID-19 lockdown, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged subpopulations. Strategies are needed to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on unhealthy weight gain and childhood obesity."
COVID-19 Transcriptomic Atlas: A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Related Transcriptomics Datasets,"The global pandemic COVID-19 is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and has infected over 110 million people, resulting in over 2.4 million deaths worldwide (WHO, 2020). The initial outbreak began in a Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread across the world (Bai et al., 2020). It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets, surface contamination, and aerosols, though the latter’s significance is unclear (Asadi et al., 2019; Wiersinga et al., 2020).IntroductionCOVID-19 causes many symptoms with most common features including: fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath (Huang et al., 2020). Lesser-known symptoms include headaches, diarrhea, and hemoptysis (Huang et al., 2020). The severity of the disease progresses from the initial onset of the first symptom, causing a deterioration in the patient’s health, followed by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and accompanied by ICU admission in a short time period (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). The heterogeneity of COVID-19 results in the differing onsets and severity of symptoms between patients, therefore, making it challenging to identify disease-specific biomarkers.IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is classified as an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA β coronavirus (Channappanavar et al., 2014). Similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 and other β coronaviruses are linked to respiratory infections in a host of species (Channappanavar et al., 2014; Yuki et al., 2020).IntroductionThe viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 begins when the virus’ Spike (S) protein attaches to the host cell’s surface receptor (Bosch et al., 2003; Yuki et al., 2020). The cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the receptor facilitating this attachment (Li et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Once the virus adheres to the cell surface, a variety of proteases including the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein which allows for cellular entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020). Studies have shown that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in lung epithelial cells, which coincides with the entry route of the virus (Shu et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020). Upon cellular entry, the virus replicates and matures before releasing itself into the host body (Yuki et al., 2020). It takes approximately 5 days for symptoms to develop following the initial exposure to the virus due to the host mounting an active immune response ((Lauer et al., 2020; Wiersinga et al., 2020).IntroductionFollowing the initial exposure, the host immune system activates its viral inflammatory response. The innate airway immune response includes epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) (Yoshikawa et al., 2009; Yuki et al., 2020). These antigen-presenting cells present the S protein to CD4+ T cells, activating B cells as part of this response (Yuki et al., 2020). During the initial stages of the disease there is an increase in IgM and IgA antibodies, followed by a prolonged presence of IgG (García, 2020). In severe case patients, there is a reduction of peripheral blood T cells and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma (García, 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). This change compromises the epithelial-endothelial barrier, leading to the development of pulmonary edema (Wiersinga et al., 2020). Alongside other complications, patients develop ARDS, followed by organ failure caused by viral sepsis in the final stages of the disease (Wiersinga et al., 2020).IntroductionSeveral studies have shown that a multitude of factors could affect the severity of the disease and the immune response. For example, ACE2 expression was found to be present in higher levels in diabetics and smokers (Brake et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Grundy et al., 2020; Wijnant et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2021). This finding leads to the belief that comorbidities play a significant role in the disease severity and progression, however, this significance needs to be further investigated.IntroductionIn the earlier stages of the outbreak, preventative measures were put in place to control and reduce the spread of infection, and several available therapeutic drugs have been repurposed for use in COVID-19 (Pradhan et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2020). These repurposed drugs aim by targeting host pathways and/or viral replication mechanisms (Bchetnia et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2020). One of the leading efforts against combating COVID-19 is the development of vaccines, with the Spike (S) protein being used as a novel target (Krammer, 2020; Poland et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2020). Currently, several vaccines are undergoing clinical trials, and the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines have received regulatory approval (Krammer, 2020; Poland et al., 2020; Administration, U.F.a.D., 2020a; Administration, U.F.a.D., 2020b; European Medicines Agency, 2021).IntroductionTo develop anti-viral drugs and vaccines, it is crucial to understand the molecular basis and pathology of COVID-19. An increase in research output is required to generate data and results at a faster rate; therefore bioinformatics plays a crucial role in COVID-19 research. There is an abundance of transcriptomic data from studies carried out in COVID-19, however, their use is limited by the confounding factors pertaining to each study. The reanalysis of all these datasets in a unified approach should help in understanding the molecular basis of COVID-19. Bioinformatics uses in-silico tools to carry out research on transcriptomic data without requiring the need to be in the lab. Tools and software platforms such as R coding language and NCBI’s GEO database allow for the reanalysis of such data (Wang et al., 2019). In this study, we aim to use the multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets retrieved from GEO database to identify consistently differential expressed genes in different tissues and clinical settings. This should allow for the identification of COVID-19 biomarkers expressed in patients and the presence of markers specific to disease severity and condition.Generating the Datasets ::: Materials and MethodsA list of datasets was generated from NCBI’s GEO database (Barrett et al., 2013) using the GEOmetadb package through the software R (Figure 1). The GEOmetadb package allows the user to query the database efficiently. Query search keywords included SARS-COV-2, and COVID-19. Datasets containing more than 10 samples in human tissues were selected (Table 1). The coding template “RNA seq tutorial” by Lauren Blake was obtained from Rpubs, a R markdown repository, and was used for the basis of this analysis (Blake, 2018). The raw data was imported into R from GEO and the readDGE function was used to create a digital gene expression matrix that was used for further processing. Each dataset was analyzed independently of other datasets (Figure 2). R packages used in this analysis include RNAseq123, gplots, RColorBrewer, R. utils, Limma, Glimma, EdgeR, Homo.sapiens, and were obtained from Bioconductor.Sample Annotation ::: Materials and MethodsSamples were annotated in R using the Homo. sapiens annotation package. The gene identidiers provided with the data was used to match the sample gene ID to the gene name in the annotation database. Samples were grouped based on the disease status and other conditions for analysis.Data Filtering and Normalization ::: Materials and MethodsData were filtered to remove all duplicate genes and the log counts per million (CPM) was calculated for genes with at least one count in three different samples. Samples were then normalized using the ‘calcNormFactors’ function provided with the edgeR package; the trimmed mean of M-value (TMM) was used as the defult normalization method. Gene expression was normalized following the construction of a linear model. The “voom” function in the limma package was used to calculate the weights of the genes in order to offset the mean-variance relationship created by the model.Sample Visualization ::: Materials and MethodsSamples were visualized at multiple stages of the analysis. The functions “plotDensities” and “boxplot” were used to visualize the samples during the filtering and normalization process. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to visualize the level of similarity and the relationship between samples based on their grouping. The “plotMDS” and “plotMD” functions were used for this visualization. The Glimma package was used to generate an interactive plot of the sample scaling and DEGs.Differentially Expressed Genes ::: Materials and MethodsDifferentially expressed genes were identified using the limma package. A contrast matrix containg sample data and information was created. The genes per sample were normalized using the “voom” function. Various functions such as ‘fit’, “eBayes”, and “treat” were used to create a linear model for each gene, and calculate various statistics for each contrast of interest in order to test for DEGs. Statistics calculated include t-statistics, log fold change (logFC), p-value, adjusted p-value, average expression, coefficients, and standard deviations. The “eBayes” and ‘treat’ functions were used to identify DEGs, that could be used for further experimentations. The list of DEGs was visualized in a table and a Venn diagram (Heberle et al., 2015), with the addition of a mean-difference (MD) and a heatmap per contrast. The “Glimma” package was used to generate an interactive MD plot, along with a gene expression plot. For all statistical values, the adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and logFC ≥2 was used to signify statistical significance.Data Intersection and Gene Enrichment ::: Materials and MethodsTo identify common DEGs among COVID-19 patients, genes from the same datasets, or similar sets in terms of tissues and conditions were intersected and compared with each other (Figure 2). Since several data sets were analyzed at multiple levels, these dataset layers were compared with each other to identify a list of common genes per condition. Gene pathway enrichment and COVID-19 reference list enrichment was carried out in metascape, a gene annotation and enrichment tool, using the identified common DEGs (Zhou et al., 2019).32 Genes Are Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Patients ::: ResultsLung tissues from deceased patients from the dataset GSE151764 were analyzed in this study (Sobottka et al., 2020). Expression of these genes were analyzed at four different levels (Figure 2). In the first analysis, control samples were compared with COVID-19 samples and five genes were identified to be DE in COVID-19 patients (Table 2). The following analyses added a secondary layer to the previous one; control and COVID-19 samples were divided into further subgroups. The second analysis used the presence or absence of pre-existing lung conditions as the secondary grouping criterion. This subgrouping has identified one DEG in COVID-19 patients without any pre-existing lung conditions, while there are 24 genes in those with pre-existing conditions.32 Genes Are Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Patients ::: ResultsThe third analysis used smoking history for the secondary grouping criteria. People with no smoking history have 4 DEGs and those with a smoking history expressing 18 DEGs. The fourth analysis compared diabetics with non diabetics as a secondary criterion and has identified two DEGS in non-diabetics and 20 DEGs in diabetic patients.32 Genes Are Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Patients ::: ResultsTable 2 contains a list of differentially expressed genes for COVID-19 patients in each specific condition.8 Genes Are Differentially Expressed in ARDS ::: ResultsThis study compares tracheal aspirates (GSE163426) taken from three types of patients, those with COVID-19 caused ARDS, those with non-COVID-19 ARDS, and controls with mechanical ventilation (Sarma et al., 2020). A total of eight genes were differentially expressed, five of which are specific in COVID-19 induced ARDS (Table 3) (Figure 6A).Upper Airway Gene Expression Reveal Different Genes Are Expressed for Different Types of Infections ::: ResultsThe analysis of GSE156063 compares the gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 infections with other respiratory infections, whether they are due to an acute illnesses or viral infections (Mick et al., 2020). Two genes (GZMB & CCL8) were differentially expressed in all cases, 71 genes were differentially expressed in respiratory infections caused by other viral infections, and 24 genes were expressed in nonviral respiratory illnesses (Table 4); (Figure 7A).Rotavirus Infections Elicit Responses Similar to That of COVID-19 ::: ResultsIn this study, three different nasal tissue samples from the dataset GSE149273 were comparable: control samples, RVC-15 and RVA-16 infected tissues (Chang et al., 2020). Of all three sample types, only the comparision of rotavirus against control tissues yielded any DEGs. Comparing both rotavirus’ with each other yielded no DEGs. One hundred sixty-six genes were differentially expressed in control samples one in RVC-15 and 49 in RVA-16 (Supplmentary Figure S2). Table 5 contains the list of DEGs for each condition.Nasopharyngeal Swabs Are a Better Diagnostic Tool for Sequencing COVID-19 Compared to Whole Blood ::: ResultsIn this study, samples were taken by both nasopharyngeal swab and whole blood (GSE163151) (Ng et al., 2020). Each sample source was analyzed independently from the other and 119 genes were found to be DE in COVID-19 patients from nasopharyngeal swab samples, while in whole blood samples, 10532 genes were identified (Figure 10).Nasopharyngeal Swabs Are a Better Diagnostic Tool for Sequencing COVID-19 Compared to Whole Blood ::: ResultsIn the nasopharyngeal swab samples, 467 genes were DE in control samples, 1865 in non-viral/bacterial cuased acute respiratory illness samples, and over 4,000 genes were differentially expressed in viral infections. On the other hand, the whole blood samples have 187 DEGs in controls, 2,262 in bacterial sepsis (non-viral) acute respiratory illness samples, and 193 genes in viral samples.There Are 79 Genes Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Patients From Whole Blood Samples, Most of Which Are Upregulated ::: ResultsWhole blood samples from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients were used (GSE152641) (Thair et al., 2020). The analysis showed that 79 genes are differentially expressed between conditions, of which 61 genes are upregulated in COVID-19 infections, and 18 are down-regulated.Abatacept Treatment Yielded No Differential Expression of Genes Compared to Control Samples ::: ResultsTaken from the dataset GSE151161, this study tested the use of abatacept in rheumatoid patients with a pathology similar to that of COVID-19 patients (Julià et al., 2020). Whole blood samples were sequenced before treatment (Week 0) and after treatment (Week 12). The analysis revealed no genes that are differentially expressed between control and treatment samples.Severe COVID-19 Patients Share all Differential Expressed Genes With That of ICU Patients ::: ResultsThe samples from this study are collected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) (GSE152418) and analyses the differences between COVID-19 disease severities (Arunachalam et al., 2020). The first comparison analyzed control samples with COVID-19 samples, resulting in 371 differentially expressed genes. Then, a second analysis was carried out based on the severity level to identify which DEGs belong to what conditions. Five hundred and four genes were identified to be differentially expressed in healthy patients, four genes in moderate patients, four in severe, and 156 in ICU patients (Table 6).Genes Linked to Cell Division Are Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Infections ::: ResultsWith over 100 samples obtained from leukocytes (GSE157103), this is one of the larger studies that were reanalyzed (Overmyer et al., 2020). This study was analyzed at four levels (Figure 2), similarly to GSE151764 reanalysis. The first analysis compared the gene expression between control samples and COVID-19 samples. Following that, a secondary division was carried out, with an analysis comparing ICU patients with non-ICU patients, and another analysis comparing ventilation use with patients not requiring ventilation. The fourth analysis used a tertiary division; therefore, it compares samples by disease state, followed by ICU status, and finally ventilation requirement.Genes Linked to Cell Division Are Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Infections ::: ResultsThe first analysis identified 115 genes to be differentially expressed. The added levels of comparisons gave more perspective to the DEGs distribution, with the following number of genes identified in each analysis (Table 7).CRTAM Is Found to Be a Common Gene Among COVID-19 Patients With Varying Comorbidities ::: DiscussionFollowing the gene expression in COVID-19 severity, it is important to look at secondary conditions and comorbidities when assessing disease progression and which genes are associated with what.CRTAM Is Found to Be a Common Gene Among COVID-19 Patients With Varying Comorbidities ::: DiscussionDue to this study being analyzed at multiple levels, it was possible to intersect and compare the data. CRTAM was identified as a common gene among COVID-19 patients, regardless of their smoking history and diabetes status (Figure 3). CRTAM, which stands for cytotoxic and regulatory T cell molecule, is the gene responsible for regulating the activation and differentiation of several T-cell subsets such as NK cells. This could indicate that the gene is essential in the prognosis of COVID-19, as it is down-regulated in COVID-19 patients and more so in those with pre-existing lung conditions, smokers and diabetics. Additionally, 14 genes are differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including MX1, OAS1, and OAS3, all of which are involved in anti-viral responses, including cytokine signaling (Figure 4).CRTAM Is Found to Be a Common Gene Among COVID-19 Patients With Varying Comorbidities ::: DiscussionThere are three genes shared between SARS-CoV-2 patients that have pre-existing lung conditions and smoking history, which are TNFSF18, TNFRSF9, NCR3. These genes are involved in cytokine signaling and regulation of T cell activation (Figure 4). No genes are shared between pre-existing lung conditions and diabetes, while diabetics have 6 DEGs in that indication. These common genes differ based on the sets compared, hinting that certain genes are affected by various factors, some more so than others.CRTAM Is Found to Be a Common Gene Among COVID-19 Patients With Varying Comorbidities ::: DiscussionEnrichment analysis of COVID-19 pathways (Figure 5), reveals that the majority of the genes are involved in the cytokine signaling pathways, followed by regulation of cytokine production and response to bacterium pathways.Genes Differentially Expressed in COVID-19 Induced ARDS Are Involved in Protein Complex Assembly ::: DiscussionOf the five DEGs in COVID-19 caused ARDS, three genes (PATL2, FHOD3, and HSPA14) were found to be linked to protein complex assembly when enriched, either through nucleotide biding or by protein binding (Figure 6). On the other hand, two genes are not involved in regulating protein complex assembly; those are GBP5, which has a role in the innate immune system and inflammation, and PHF11, which is linked to asthma. Regardless, the other three ARDS-causing genes could be attributed as part of the body mechanisms instead of the COVID-19 viral-induced mechanisms. When attempting to enrich the COVID-19 pathways, none of the five COVID-19 ARDS-causing genes were found to be linked to any of the pathways (Supplmentary Figure S1).Differentially Expressed Genes Are Involved in Cytokine Signaling and Antiviral Mechanisms ::: DiscussionWhile identifying DEGs of COVID-19 is important, the disease is caused by a virus, and all viruses elicit similier immune responses. Therefore, comparing the differential expression of COVID-19 to that of other respiratory illnesses caused by both viral and nonviral factors is cruical. Two DEGS were identified in all types of infections (Figure 7A). Gene enrichment of all 97 common genes shows that most of the identified genes are involved in cytokine signaling and the immune responses (Figure 7B). Enrichment against COVID-19 reference lists (Figure 8) reveals that most of these genes are specific for cytokine signaling; this is because across the gene input list, only two genes were found to be common between SARS-CoV-2 and other illnesses while the others are differentially expressed for other respiratory illnesses. This serves as an indicator that the potential list of genes that could be used as COVID-19 specific biomarkers is small.Rotavirus Infections Induce Cytokine Signaling Pathways and upregulate MX1, MX2, and Various Interleukins ::: DiscussionOur reanalysis validated this study’s findings as ACE2 expression has been upregulated in both RVC-15 and RVA-16 samples. Additionally, MX1 and MX2, genes that are associated with anti-viral response, were upregulated in the viral infected samples. Furthermore, various interleukins have also been upregulated in the rotavirus infected samples, including IL7R, IL19, and IL4I1. The implication of ACE2 being upregulated in other viral infections reveals that COVID-19 is not the only virus that upregulates this gene. This further proves the need to compare the identified DEGs to that of other viruses and/or illneses, especially of those with similar structure or pathology.Rotavirus Infections Induce Cytokine Signaling Pathways and upregulate MX1, MX2, and Various Interleukins. Figure 9A reveals the enriched pathways of the 51 DEGs in both RVA-16 and RVC-15. The two most expressed pathways are that of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and the cytokine signaling in the immune system. Both pathways are part of the immune system’s response to pathogens. Most of the pathways involve the immune system response to pathogenic invasion, such as activating myeloid leukocytes, resulting in an immune response that affects other pathways. Of the RVA-16 and RVC-15 differential expressed genes (Figure 9B), not many are shared with COVID-19 gene lists, and if shared they are at low levels. However, the cytokine signaling in the immune system pathway has the highest level of enrichment, indicating that rotavirus’ can stimulate the same cytokine pathways involved in COVID-19 infections.Genes That Are Common in Both Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Whole Blood Sequencing Are Linked to Interferon Signaling and Response to Interferon-Alpha ::: DiscussionNasopharyngeal swab samples, reveal 48 genes that are common between COVID-19 and nonviral acute respiratory infections (Figure 10A). Only 20 DEGS are specific to COVID-19 that are not shared with any other indications (Table 8), and therefore, could be used as potential biomarkers.Genes That Are Common in Both Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Whole Blood Sequencing Are Linked to Interferon Signaling and Response to Interferon-Alpha ::: DiscussionWhole blood samples had a higher number of DEGs in COVID-19, including DEGs specific to COVID-19 (Figure 10B). Of these genes, 701 were common with bacterial sepsis, and 26 were common with other viral infections.Genes That Are Common in Both Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Whole Blood Sequencing Are Linked to Interferon Signaling and Response to Interferon-Alpha ::: DiscussionThis difference in the number of differentially expressed genes is expected due to the different tissue sources used for sequencing. When comparing the COVID-19 DEGs from both sample sources, 58 genes are found to be common (Figure 11A). However, comparing the COVID-19 specific DEGs, five genes were found to be common between the two sample types (Figure 11B).Genes That Are Common in Both Nasopharyngeal Swabs and Whole Blood Sequencing Are Linked to Interferon Signaling and Response to Interferon-Alpha ::: DiscussionGene enrichment through metascape reveals that response to interferon-alpha is the most enriched pathway (Figure 12). Other enriched pathways include GO:0070268 cornification, which is linked to cell death, and GO:0071772 response to BMP, which results from a response of growth factors. Enriching against COVID-19 reference lists, reveals that the interferon pathway is the only common pathway between this list of DEGs and the publically available list of COVID-19 genes (Supplmentary Figure S3). This finding helps in understanding the clinical differences between responses present in the site of infection (nasal/pharynx) compared to that of the immune system (blood circulation) and how sample locations affects sequencing results.Differentially Expressed Genes Are Linked to Viral Entry and the Immune Response ::: DiscussionOff the 79 DEGs in GSE152641, the ratio of upregulated genes to downregulated genes in COVID-19 was higher (Table 9). Some of the upregulated genes include SIGRR, NOG, SDC1 and IGFBP2, all of which are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling (Figure 13). Other genes are involved with various immune pathways and anti-viral responses, such as those genes involved in interaction with the host. Though in comparision with COVID-19 reference lists, enrichment for the DEGs is low, with the highest level of enrichment is that for autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematous, followed by leukocyte migration and viral entry into the host cell (Supplmentary Figure S4).Differentially Expressed Genes Are Linked to Viral Entry and the Immune Response ::: DiscussionThe genes involved in the viral entry are of importance due to their link with the virus, as preventing viral access to the host is one of the main courses of action for preventing COVID-19. However, a point of importance is that while these pathways are enriched, they are done at low levels compared to the other COVID-19 lists.Transcriptomic In-Silico Studies Are Not Enough to Validate Data ::: DiscussionOur results for this analysis have shown no differential expression of genes; however, the study (GSE151161) has carried out further experiments to validate their results. Therfore, this analysis is a reminder to not depend entirely on data and results generated in-silico and that further validation is required. We should use more than transcriptomics to answer our questions.Hemostasis Is the Most Enriched Pathway for COVID-19 Patients ::: DiscussionDisease progression is dependent on the immune response to viral infection and the genetic predisposition a patient has. When intersecting and comparing the differentially expressed genes for each severity, all DEGs for severe patients were common with those of ICU patients (Supplmentary Figure S5). It is important to note that gene expression levels between severe and ICU are similar to each other due most severe patients ending up in the ICU. The genes commonly expressed in severe and ICU patients are associated with GO processes involving the regulation of cell differentiation. Furthermore, 70 DEGs are shared between healthy and severe COVID-19 patients, while all four differentially expressed genes for moderate disease state is specific for those with moderate disease. These common genes between healthy and ICU patients are noteworthy due to their presence in these two conditions. One of these genes is HLX, which is found to be upregulated in healthy patients compared to COVID-19 patients. However, when comparing HLX’s expression based on severity levels, this gene is upregulated in ICU patients in comparision to the other disease states and healthy individuals. This difference in expression based on the state of severity indicates that there are potential genes that are linked to the disease state rather than the disease as a whole.Hemostasis Is the Most Enriched Pathway for COVID-19 Patients ::: DiscussionGene enrichment analysis revealed that in pawthway gene enrichment (Figure 14A), most DEGs are commonly found in the hemostasis pathways, followed by regulating exocytosis. Several of the other pathways are involved in cell differentiation, such as GO:0090287 process, which regulates cell response to growth factors, or R-HSA-1474244 extracellular matrix organization. Following other enriched pathways, all pathways are linked and result in the formation of blood vessels in a chain reaction.Hemostasis Is the Most Enriched Pathway for COVID-19 Patients ::: DiscussionSimilarly, when testing against the COVID-19 lists (Figure 14B), similar pathways are enriched, such as the hemostasis pathway, which appears to be highly expressed in this list compared to the other COVID-19 lists. The regulated exocytosis pathway is one of the few pathways that are expressed at similar rates to that of other lists. Unlike the other lists which involve cytokine signaling, this dataset, relies on the complement and coagulation cascades in their immune response.Hemostasis Is the Most Enriched Pathway for COVID-19 Patients ::: DiscussionComparing results of ICU patients from this study with that of another study (GSE157103) there were 9 DEGs common between ICU COVID-19 patients (Figure 15A). Following gene enrichment, these DEGs are involved in extracellular matrix organization and regulation of the inflammatory response (Figure 15B). However, when enriching them to that of COVID-19 lists [Supplmentary Figure S6], only the ECM organization pathway is common among the different lists.ICU Patients, Regardless of Ventilation Use, Differentially Expressed Genes That Are Involved With Cell Division ::: DiscussionWhen comparing the genes of COVID-19 in those with and without ventilation, seven genes have been identified to be common between the two conditions (Figure 16A). These genes are expressed in COVID-19 regardless of the requirement for ventilation, hinting that they play a central role in COVID-19. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis (Figure 16B) shows that these seven genes are involved with cytokinesis and cell division. Further anlysis through the COVID-19 reference lists reveal that these genes are still linked to cell division (Supplmentary Figure S7). An important factor to note is that most patients that require ventilation are those who are admitted to the ICU, this could be seen in the fourth analysis, where ICU patients that require ventilation, have more DEGs compared to the other conditions (Table 7). For example, ICU COVID-19 patients alone have more DEGs (431 genes) than non-ICU patients, the same for those that require ventilation (394 genes), which is more prominent when combining them both in the fourth analysis (Table 7).ICU Patients, Regardless of Ventilation Use, Differentially Expressed Genes That Are Involved With Cell Division ::: DiscussionEnriching the 387 COVID-19 ventilation specific genes (Figure 17A), revealed that most of the genes expressed are involved in cell division and cell cycle pathways. Comparing the DEGs to that of COVID-19 gene lists (Figure 17B), reveals the genes involved are those of the immune system pathways. This shows pathway enrichment analysis for genes yields different results than enrichment analysis specific for COVID-19.ICU Patients, Regardless of Ventilation Use, Differentially Expressed Genes That Are Involved With Cell Division ::: DiscussionAs mentioned previously, the ICU genes of this data set were intersected with another dataset (GSE152418) and nine genes were found to be common between these two studies (Figure 15A).The Most Common Pathways Enriched Between Datasets Involve the Immune System and Its Regulation ::: DiscussionSeveral pathways have been enriched in multiple datasets (Table 10), with cytokine signaling pathways and response to bacterium pathways being the most common. All of the enriched pathways involve the immune system, revealing a close link between viral infections and the immune response.The Most Common Pathways Enriched Between Datasets Involve the Immune System and Its Regulation ::: DiscussionHowever, in COVID-19 enriched pathways, there is a different set of genes and pathways that are enriched (Table 11).The Most Common Pathways Enriched Between Datasets Involve the Immune System and Its Regulation ::: DiscussionThe majority of COVID-19 enriched pathways are mostly involved in the regulatory aspect of the immune system. This sheds light to the viral mechanisms and how the virus affects the immune system, such as negatively regulating the immune response, one of the main causes for ARDS and disease progression. The most common pathways involved are those of the cytokines, more importantly interferons, which play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2. Another pathway of interest is the response to bacterium pathway which is present in four different enriched lists from different datasets, indicating that perhaps COVID-19 could affect the microbiome. A clear link between these pathways can be seen as responding to the viral infections results into activation and subsequent regulation of the immune system and it’s various components. Studying the link between these pathways and the genes involved in them should give a better understanding of COVID-19 molecular basis and pathology.ConclusionUsing publicly available transcriptomic data we were able to identify differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2 in multiple data sets (Figure 2). Of the nine data sets that were analyzed, only eight provided a list of differentially expressed genes. Using these lists of genes, the data was intersected and compared, where viable, and common genes between and within the datasets were found. However, each dataset contained a different number of genes in total, therefore the number of genes analyzed differened between datasets. Several genes have been present in several analyses as consistant DEGs, though the significance of their presence varied from analysis to another.ConclusionCRTAM has been identified as a gene that is present in COVID-19 patients, regardless of their comorbidities. Other genes such as CCRL2 and CCR6, even though belonging to the same family of chemokine, are differently regulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, there seem to be several genes that are common between SARS-CoV-2 infection and other respiratory-causing viral infections such as MX1 which was also differentialy expressed in rotavirus infectoins. Furthermore, as the severity increases, the amount of shared genes increases, such as in GSE152418, all DEGs in severe patients were also expressed in ICU patients. Likewise, in GSE157103, when intersecting the DEGs for COVID-19 ICU with COVID-19 ventilation, there were many common genes between them.ConclusionAn important note of observation is that the sample source played an important role in identifying differentially expressed genes. Such as when comparing gene expression from nasopharyngeal swabs with those from whole blood, the number of common genes of COVID-19 with other viral infections was higher in blood than in the nasal samples. However, there are 58 genes common between nasal swabs and whole blood, most of which are involved in antiviral responses. When comparing ARDS induced by either SARS-CoV-2, mechanical ventilation, or other respiratory illnesses, only five genes were identified as differentially expressed, one of which is involved with asthma and the other the immune system.ConclusionFrom this analysis, we can conclude that several genes appear to be less commonly expressed in different indications; however, their significance varies depending on the disease state and sample source. Some of the results of this analysis also validated some of the findings of the studies used. Further analysis is needed along with experimental validation to identify the potential biomarkers that could be used to characterize COVID-19 infections."
