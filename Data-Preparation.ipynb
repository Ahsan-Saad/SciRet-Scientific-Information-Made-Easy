METHODS: We compared our planning and experience at a tertiary care academic medical center to recommendations in the literature. RESULTS: Published literature and our experience underscored the need to plan for adequate dialysis equipment, particularly for continuous renal replacement therapy in the ICU setting, adequate nursing, and flexible scheduling of chronic patients to accommodate the surge in acute patients. We discovered other “shortages” not mentioned in the literature: shortages in the number of portable reverse osmosis (RO) machines needed to prepare dialysis water, inadequate number of rooms in units designated for COVID-19 patients with plumbing for dialysis, and lack of temperature blending valves on sinks that necessitated using cold water only, and damaging the RO membranes. We identified the need for cooperation between nephrology and critical care medicine, hospital-based and community nephrologists and community dialysis units as well as nephrologists at other hospitals in the region. We turned to guidance from the hospital ethics committee. CONCLUSION: Planning for an expected surge in hospitalized patients requiring RRT demands coordination between critical care, dialysis and nursing services as well as community and hospital providers to make certain there are adequate dialysis resources. Our experience suggests that continuous dialysis is in greatest demand early in the illness, and that plans to increase supplies should be put in place. But, planning should also focus on unforeseen hospital-specific infrastructure shortages that can develop over time and hamper intermittent dialysis delivery to all patients who require treatment.'],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":35}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DNU_XCYltTES","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661142370704,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":19936,"user":{"displayName":"Debugged Coder","userId":"04634240318588129634"}},"outputId":"5a784b73-932a-48d0-f71a-845f32a83115"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["final_df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Anas New Dataset/selected_122235_data.csv', index =True)\n"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-20T12:58:24.283373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-20T12:58:24.284298Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-20T12:59:18.301166Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-20T12:58:24.284242Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-20T12:59:18.299948Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"Gf2XvP25T9jz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"edoPNPgOwlWt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
