# SciRet-Scientific-Information-Made-Easy

SciRet is a system designed to retrieve authentic and informative data from a dataset of scientific research papers, simplify the information for better understanding by the general public, and provide accurate answers to user queries. My team and I developed this research as part of our thesis project for the Senior Project Design courses. Later, we also presented this project during the Capstone. In recognition of its innovation and impact, our research was placed among the top 3 projects in the 2022 Innovation Challenge, held at North South University, Bangladesh. This repository contains the implementation and codebase for the research paper.

My co-authors are Prof. Dr. Ashrafuzzaman Khan, Kaysarul Anas, and Rofiqul Alam Shehab.

### Forking Reason  
This project was collaboratively developed as part of our undergraduate research, with all code and commits made from a shared lab computer under one GitHub ID. As a result, my individual GitHub ID does not appear in the commit history. I have forked this repository to my personal account to reflect my significant contributions to the project and ensure transparency regarding my involvement.

## My Contributions

I was involved in all aspects of the project, playing a significant role in the following areas:

### Data Preprocessing:
- Led the preprocessing of the Coronavirus Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) dataset, converting data from JSON to CSV format.
- Applied various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and standardize the data, making it suitable for model training.
- Ensured the dataset was prepared in a way that was compatible with the RAG model, optimizing it for passage retrieval.

### Model Training and Fine-Tuning:
- Developed and fine-tuned the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model for passage retrieval from scientific research papers.
- Conducted experiments with different models, including the initial GPT-Neo, and ultimately enhanced the architecture for better retrieval performance.
- Fine-tuned the model for improved accuracy in retrieving passages relevant to user queries.

### Research and Results Analysis:
- Co-designed the research methodology, focusing on the retrieval of relevant passages from scientific papers.
- Analyzed the performance of the RAG model using multiple evaluation metrics.
- Contributed to writing sections of the paper, detailing the technical aspects of the system, model implementation, and analysis of results.

### Collaboration:
- Coordinated with teammates to ensure smooth integration of data processing and model training workflows.
- Played an active role in brainstorming, problem-solving, and refining the projectâ€™s approach.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** Worked with the Coronavirus Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19), a large and complex dataset of COVID-19 related scientific literature.
- **Modeling:** Developed a passage retrieval system using the RAG model, enhancing access to scientific research for the general public.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved significant performance improvements, enabling more accurate retrieval of passages based on user queries.
- **Impact:** This project makes scientific research papers more accessible and usable for the general public, empowering science enthusiasts and professionals alike.

## Manuscript Submission

Although the research was completed and the paper was prepared, we could not proceed with submitting the manuscript for publication. The research was completed by July 2022, and soon after, the release of ChatGPT in November 2022 introduced new developments in the field, which led us to reassess the relevance of our work in light of these advancements. Additionally, due to budgetary constraints and changing priorities at the time, we did not pursue funding for the publication. As a result, we decided to hold off on submitting the paper for publication, choosing instead to focus on exploring how the evolving landscape of AI, including tools like ChatGPT, could influence the direction of future research.

### Acknowledgment  
This project was a collaborative effort, and I acknowledge the contributions of my teammates and supervisors who played an essential role in its success.
